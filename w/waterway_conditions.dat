The tower-shaft as well as the upper storeys of the Tegeler Plate lighthouse were intended to be entirely built as steel construction. The tower-shaft's height of about 46 m as well as the local shallow water conditions (i.e. average low tide about 2.50 m above ground level) made it possible to pile jet the tower-shaft 18 m deep into the sand in one step. To this end, jetting the tower-shaft into sand as a first step was considered to be followed by placing the upper storeys on top as a second step. In this manner corrections of slight discrepancies of the shaft could be made.|$|E

40|$|Coastal areas {{across the}} world are {{experiencing}} rapid population growth. One of the main drivers of this growth is the aesthetic value of coastal regions, which is based at least partly on good environmental quality. However, {{in the absence of}} good management, this population growth has the potential to degrade environmental quality. Changes in coastal condition are not only important in terms of environmental impacts, but are also likely to affect {{the quality of life of}} people living in the coastal zone. Information on potential social implications of resource management actions is increasingly required before management decisions are made. However, there are few tools available to assess the impacts of changes in environmental resource condition on people. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a system dynamics model that can be used to assess the potential impacts of changes in the <b>condition</b> of coastal <b>waterways</b> on human quality of life. The model is based on the Pumicestone catchment in south-east Queensland. It consists of three sub-models; environmental condition, human health, and social wellbeing. The environmental sub-model is very simple, and includes population growth and management actions driving decreases and increases in <b>waterway</b> <b>condition</b> respectively. <b>Waterway</b> <b>condition</b> is made up of water quality, vegetation and biota. The health model is driven by changes in the environmental sub-model. Enterococci concentrations (a water quality indicator) are positively related to the risk of coming down with gastrointestinal illness; bacterial and heavy metal contamination of oysters (biota indicator) leads to increased health risk and the potential closure of oyster aquaculture farms; and increased iron concentrations in the water promote summer blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula (vegetation indicator), which can cause dermatitis in swimmers. Perceived <b>waterway</b> <b>condition</b> is driven by overall <b>waterway</b> <b>condition</b> (comprising water quality, vegetation and biota) and affects the frequency and duration of recreational visits made to coastal waterways. Recreational visits result in greater amounts of exercise, and also contribute to overall mental and physical health. In terms of social impacts, recreational visits are related to attachment to place and social interaction, which in turn lead to wider social networks and the sense of belonging to the place, significant determinants of quality of life. Place attachment is also related to willingness to contribute to an area and rates of volunteerism, both of which have positive contributions to waterway management. Results from three scenarios show that social and health aspects of wellbeing deteriorate as a result of population growth in the absence of management, but improve if management efforts are sufficient to offset the negative impacts from population growth. However, the positive effects are diminished, and in some cases do not occur within the model timescale, when management efforts are delayed relative to population growth. Dynamic models offer a potentially very useful tool for integrated impact assessment. The integrated quality of life assessment framework described here can be easily generalised to other places and situations, including other types of natural resource management, and offers a potentially valuable tool for natural resource managers...|$|R

40|$|Waterways offer a {{range of}} {{environmental}} and social benefits for people living in South East Queensland. The impact of these benefits is important to understand. Each year, Healthy Land and Water produces an annual report card on environmental conditions and social impacts of the waterways across 19 catchment areas in South East Queensland (SEQ). The Report Card provides an annual assessment of the pressures facing our waterways, their current environmental condition (A-F grade), {{and the level of}} social and economic benefit the waterways provide to local communities (1 - 5 star rating). The 2017 QUT social science report contributes the social research data for the Healthy Land and Water annual Report Card. The study provides the social component of evidence, specifically the attitudinal and behavioural components that underpin social expectations and actions towards valuing and using local and SEQ waterways in communities across the 19 catchment areas. The 2017 social science study is guided by a conceptual-based model and two research questions focusing on the social benefits of waterways – specifically to understand the relationship between waterway condition and perceptions of waterway useability, accessibility and satisfaction, within an engagement framework. The questions specifically investigated to what extent do people use, value and benefit from engaging with in their local waterways, and to what extent do <b>waterway</b> <b>conditions</b> impact the use and enjoyment of these waterways? Data for the study were collected through a self-administered 15 minute online survey. Questions for the survey were developed from modified existing scale items and questions used in previous Healthy Waterway surveys to allow comparison. The sample was adults living in the 19 catchment areas in South East Queensland (SEQ) The 2017 survey used two recruitment strategies for sampling; panel (n = 3200) and social media (n = 722), as a way to increase representation in the Stanley, mid Brisbane and Upper Brisbane catchments. It should be noted that analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the panel and social media data and these are therefore reported separately. Data were analysed using the statistical packages SPSS (23). Quantitative analyses provided frequencies, mean statistics, correlations regressions and cluster analysis. The study found respondents confirmed local waterways in particular, play a valuable and important role in their daily lives and that they enjoyed {{a range of}} wellness benefits from their use. Swimming and recreational activities alongside waterways, such as walking, cycling and picnics, were the most popular activities, with fishing featuring more prominently in some catchments. Similar to previous years, while local waterways were viewed as very accessible, useable, and that respondents were generally satisfied overall, the response means (average score) on all these indicators were lower than previous years. Respondents’ life satisfaction scores were found to be positively related to satisfaction of waterways and <b>waterway</b> <b>conditions</b> (local and SEQ level). This means that those people who used or visited waterways were generally more satisfied with their lives. In addition, waterway place attachment - or the benefits the respondents feel they receive from their local waterways – were reported as high in coastal aligned catchments, such as Moreton Bay and Islands Catchment, while social value – or the level of value respondents receive from using waterways with their friends and family – were reported as high in the Mid Brisbane catchment area. Conditions of local waterways, such as perceptions of water clarity and cleanliness, were found to influence activities in or alongside a waterway. The study also found that in general, people were limited in their protection activities. For those who did report being active in stewardship, rubbish clean-up and monitoring were the most commonly undertaken. Tallebudgera showed the highest levels of stewardship with their local waterways while Upper Brisbane showed the lowest levels.

40|$|Ephemeral streams are {{waterways}} with poorly defined {{channels and}} episodic flow. Globally, {{the occurrence of}} ephemeral streams appears to be increasing due to drying trends driven by climate change, {{as well as a}} result of increased water abstraction. Simultaneously, these pressures result in increased vulnerability of ephemeral streams, as flow rates decline from intermittent to entirely absent. Despite this, ephemeral waterways are broadly neglected by ecologists, and no tailored measures are available to study the health of these systems.

This research report documents the social component of evidence, specifically the attitudinal and behavioural components that underpin social expectations and actions towards valuing and using local and SEQ waterways in communities across the 18 catchment areas in Queensland. The study design and findings from the 2016 Healthy Waterways social study are provided. In 2016, two key research questions guided the research project. The research questions focused on waterway use and <b>waterway</b> <b>condition.</b> The questions investigated {{to what extent do}} people use local and SEQ waterways, and to what extent do the <b>conditions</b> of SEQ <b>waterways</b> impact the use and enjoyment of these waterways? The items use to answer these questions were based on existing measures, but also included specific questions and issues used historically in the 2015 survey. A number of constructs or topic areas were identified for the survey that had previously rated survey items (i. e. they have been tested in previous research and found to have reliability and validity). Data for the study were collected through a self-administered 20 minute online survey developed from established scale items and modified for use. In addition, historical questions were used to provide comparative data based on previous surveys. The sample was adults living in the 18 catchment areas in South East Queensland (SEQ) recruited using panel data (n= 3263). Data were analysed using the statistical packages SPSS (23).

In particular, it focuses on strategies to improve the performances of the different links of the intermodal transport chain: the barge transport services, the transhipment at terminals and pre- and post-truck haulage operations. The thesis shows {{that the development of}} more complex barge transport services, implemented for instance in collection/distribution-, trunk-feeder- and hub-and-spoke service networks, can improve the market position of barge transport in the hinterland transport of containers and enables to open up new markets for intermodal barge transport. However, to support the well-functioning of these service networks appropriate terminal and transhipment concepts are needed. Basically there are three ‘locations’ in the network where tailor-made barge handling innovations are needed: (1) in the seaport, (2) in the capillaries of the waterway network and (3) in strategically located inland nodes, e. g. to support hub-and-spoke networks. In pre- and post-truck haulage, which has a relatively large share in the total chain costs, the challenge is to improve the organisation of these hauls through combining loaded trips.

Two hypotheses can explain carnivore presence in riparian ecosystems. Higher riparian plant richness, diversity, and structure provide the resources used by carnivores (resting sites, cover, and food). Alternatively, areas with higher water availability allow species to withstand water loss and thermal gradients in the high summer temperatures. In southern Portugal we surveyed 70 transects 2 km long along riparian ecosystems during the wet winter months {{and again in the}} dry summer months, recording signs of carnivore species and the environmental context in which they occurred (vegetation descriptors, surrounding landscape, and <b>waterway</b> type and <b>condition).</b> Five carnivore species used riparian ecosystems (stone marten [Martes foina], Eurasian badger [Meles meles], common genet [Genetta genetta], Egyptian mongoose [Herpestes ichneumon], and red fox [Vulpes vulpes]). Riparian ecosystems had a diverse and heterogeneous plant community with a mix of obligate riparian, Mediterranean sclerophyllous, and exotic species. Most carnivore species responded to water channel type and standing water availability in both seasons, except for the stone marten in the wet season, which uses areas with rich riparian vegetation. Our results suggest that the use of riparian ecosystems is linked to water availability that provides water, prey, and external temperature regulation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} economic globalization, {{the scale}} of transportation through ports and waterways has increased sharply. As the capacity of maritime infrastructure in ports and inland waterways is limited, {{it is important to}} simulate vessel behavior to balance safety and capacity in restricted waterways. Currently many existing vessel simulation models focus mainly on vessel dynamics and maritime traffic in the open ocean. These models are, however, inapplicable to simulating vessel behavior in ports and inland waterways, because behavior in such areas can be influenced by many factors, such as <b>waterway</b> geometry, external <b>conditions</b> and human factors. To better simulate vessel behavior in ports and waterways, we developed a new maritime traffic model by adapting the theory of pedestrian models. This new model comprises two parts: the Route Choice Model and the Operational Model. The Route Choice Model has been demonstrated and calibrated in our recent study, in which the desired speed is generated. This paper presents {{the second part of the}} model, the Operational Model, which describes vessel behavior based on optimal control by using the output of the Route Choice Model. The calibration of the Operational Model is carried out as well. In the Operational Model, the main behavioral assumption is that all actions of the bridge team, such as accelerating and turning, are executed to force the vessel to sail with the desired speed and course. In the proposed theory, deviating from the desired speed and course, accelerating, decelerating and turning will provide disutility (cost) to the vessel. By predicting and minimizing this disutility, longitudinal acceleration and angular acceleration can be optimized. This way, the Operational Model can be used to predict the vessel speed and course. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data of unhindered vessel behavior in the Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were used to calibrate the Operational Model. The calibration results produced plausible parameter values that minimized the objective function. The paths generated with these optimal parameters corresponded reasonably well to the actual paths.

40|$|The Earth's land surface, {{including}} its biomass, {{is an integral}} part of the Earth's weather and climate system. Land surface heterogeneity, such as the type and amount of vegetative covering., has a profound effect on local weather variability and therefore on regional variations of the global climate. Surface conditions affect local weather and climate through a number of mechanisms. First, they determine the re-distribution of the net radiative energy received at the surface, through the atmosphere, from the sun. A certain fraction of this energy increases the surface ground temperature, another warms the near-surface atmosphere, and the rest evaporates surface water, which in turn creates clouds and causes precipitation. Second, they determine how much rainfall and snowmelt can be stored in the soil and how much instead runs off into <b>waterways.</b> Finally, surface <b>conditions</b> influence the near-surface concentration and distribution of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The processes through which these mechanisms interact with the atmosphere can be modeled mathematically, to within some degree of uncertainty, on the basis of underlying physical principles. Such a land surface model provides predictive capability for surface variables including ground temperature, surface humidity, and soil moisture and temperature. This information is important for agriculture and industry, as well as for addressing fundamental scientific questions concerning global and local climate change. In this study we apply a methodology known as tangent linear modeling to help us understand more deeply, the behavior of the Mosaic land surface model, a model that has been developed over the past several years at NASA/GSFC. This methodology allows us to examine, directly and quantitatively, the dependence of prediction errors in land surface variables upon different vegetation conditions. The work also highlights the importance of accurate soil moisture information. Although surface variables are predicted imperfectly due to inherent uncertainties in the modeling process, our study suggests how satellite observations can be combined with the model, through land surface data assimilation, to improve their prediction...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{beneficial}} use of dredged sediments to reverse land subsidence in lowlands and delta areas is explored. The major constraints for beneficial use of sediments are the contaminant concentrations, {{and the proper}} managing {{of supply and demand}} of  sediments (Chapter 1). When sediments are transferred from <b>waterways</b> to upland <b>conditions,</b> a series of processes take place that transform the waterlogged sediments into aerated soils, a process known as ripening. To understand the relation between the sediments and the soils formed, physical/chemical and biological processes were studied at three scales: laboratory scale, mesoscale, and field scale. The knowledge obtained with these experiments can provide guidelines to effectively use dredged sediments to reverse land subsidence. In the laboratory experiments, the environmental conditions were controlled, leading to constant water content and optimal oxygen concentration for biological processes. In the mesoscale experiment, the environmental parameters such as wind, precipitation and temperature, were not controlled as the 1 m 3 containers used for these experiments were placed outside, in open air conditions. Still, the water level could be monitored and controlled, and the subsidence of the dredged sediment could be monitored. In the field experiment, the environmental and filling conditions could not be controlled but the changes occurring in the deposit were monitored. In the first laboratory experiment (Chapter 2) the behaviour of dredged sediments with varying particle size distribution and organic matter content was studied. The dredged sediments were dewatered using suction chambers and then submitted to biochemical ripening during 141 days. The five types of dredged sediments had similar overall behaviour. The most significant observation was that most volume lost during dewatering and biochemical ripening was due to shrinkage and not to organic matter mineralization. Furthermore, the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification, i. e., more stable compounds were formed. The soils formed from biochemical ripening of dredged sediments had very stable aggregates and the load-bearing capacity was enough to sustain cattle and tractors. The second laboratory experiment (Chapter 3) was designed to investigate the influence of mixing compost and the solid fraction of swine manure (low in nutrients) with dredged sediments on dewatering and biochemical ripening. When the supply of dredged sediments is too low to compensate for land subsidence, bio-wastes, such as compost and manure, can be mixed with the sediments to reverse land subsidence. The results of this experiment confirm that most volume lost during ripening was due to shrinkage and not due to organic matter mineralization. Adding compost or the solid fraction of manure to the dredged sediments enhances the changes in the type of organic matter and CO 2 production, i. e., the addition results in increased rates of organic matter mineralization which is described in the literature as the priming effect.  In addition, the undrained shear strength of the mixtures of sediments with compost or manure was three times higher than the measured values for the sediments alone, meaning that organic amendments will improve the characteristics of the soil formed from ripening of sediments. The mesoscale experiment (Chapter 4) was performed during 400 days in 1 m 3 containers which allowed to control the water level. Two scenarios were tested: upland deposits in which the sediments are allowed to dry; and underwater deposits in which the water level is always 2 cm above the sediments. It was expected that the upland deposit conditions would lead to a higher subsidence than the underwater conditions. However, subsidence of the sediments was very similar for the two scenarios. Also in these experiments it was observed that most subsidence could be attributed to shrinkage and not organic matter mineralization, and the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification. Furthermore, the water balance indicated that evapotranspiration results in higher loss of water than drainage. Still, in this case the undrained shear strength after 400 days of experiment was not enough to sustain cattle or tractors even though it increased with time. The monitored field scale upland deposit of dredged sediments (Chapter 5) is located in the Wormer- en Jisperveld area – North Holland, the Netherlands. The deposit was filled in two stages reaching a maximum height of sediments of 195 cm. After 17 months of monitoring, the subsidence of the sediments was 119 cm to which an extra subsidence of 19. 5 cm of the underlying soil due to the overburden pressure was added. The results observed in the upland deposit are in line with the laboratory and mesoscale results since subsidence could also be attributed to shrinkage and no significant changes in the organic matter content were observed. However, {{in the case of the}} upland deposit, the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification during the first 8 months (March to November), then stabilized during 7 months (November to June), and changed in the direction of mineralization afterwards. The outcomes of this research indicate that dredged sediments have the potential to reverse land subsidence. This statement is supported by the consistent results showing that the decrease in volume of dredged sediments is caused by shrinkage and not to organic matter mineralization as traditionally reported (Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5). In addition, in places where composted and stable bio-wastes are available, these can be added to dredged sediments to further reverse land subsidence. Still, in this case special attention should be given to the potential priming effect (Chapter 3). Finally it is recommended to adapt the current practices of disposal of dredged sediments in upland deposits, since 19. 5 cm of subsidence observed for the underlying soil in the upland deposit (Chapter 5), was caused by the overburden pressure of the dredged sediment. From the point of view of avoiding/reversing land subsidence it is recommended to spread thin layers (in the order of cm) of sediments over the land, although this might lead to an increase in the time and costs for the stakeholders involved in dredging and in managing the water boards...|$|R
