5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
25|$|Sarah is {{the female}} {{half of the}} lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is {{cautious}} and fearful around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> and what she thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also {{emphasizes the importance of}} contact.|$|E
25|$|Just as the Athenians were {{preparing}} to sail home, on August 28, there was a lunar eclipse, and Nicias, described by Thucydides as a particularly superstitious man, asked the priests <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> They suggested the Athenians wait for another 27 days, and Nicias agreed. The Syracusans took advantage of this, and 76 of their ships attacked 86 Athenian ships in the harbour. The Athenians were defeated and Eurymedon was killed. Many of the ships were pushed on to the shore, where Gylippus was waiting. He killed some of the crews and captured 18 beached ships, but a force of Athenians and Etruscans forced Gylippus back.|$|E

25|$|Stefan said {{he would}} have tried out the last idea at his own house in England. He {{probably}} meant St Thomas's Mills at Stratford, London, which Henry had given him, then taken away in 1544. Stefan seems not to have found work, but he did come back to England. On 9 January 1547, the Imperial ambassador in London, François van der Delft, wrote to Mary of Austria to ask <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> about Haschenperg. Stefan and his wife had come to London thinking that Mary's letters would get his job back. Van der Delft suggested he should not intercede between Henry VIII and his servant. Stefan then became a steward of Jan Dubravius, Bishop of Olmütz, in Bohemia.|$|E
25|$|In 189, the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo took {{advantage}} of the power vacuum, created {{in the aftermath of the}} conflict between the regent He Jin and the eunuch faction, to seize control of the Han central government and hold the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage in the imperial capital, Luoyang. Yang Yuan (楊原), the Prefect of Zhongmu County, started panicking and wanted to abandon his post and leave. Ren Jun advised him to stay and urged him to take the lead in calling for everyone to rise up against Dong Zhuo and overthrow him. When Yang Yuan asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> Ren Jun advised him to assume the position of acting Intendant of Henan (河南尹), bring all the counties in Henan Commandery under his leadership, and rally as many men as possible to form an army to fight Dong Zhuo's forces. Yang Yuan appointed Ren Jun as his Registrar (主簿) and proceeded to implement his suggestions.|$|E
25|$|Artemus {{is held by}} {{officials}} of an unnamed government (the nation had an arsenal of Cruise Missiles and Minutemen, though the United States is not directly named) who fear his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around {{the will of the}} omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy can read the thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and unsure of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership.|$|E
50|$|After Larive was caught, he was interrogated {{by a local}} Gestapo officer.

Lawrence responded furiously, calling him a moron and a traitor. When he replied {{that he had no}} other prospects now that the war was over and asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> Lawrence suggested [...] "Go live with the Arabs." [...] Bodley said his conversation with Lawrence, which lasted [...] "less than 200 seconds", proved to be life-changing. He promptly sorted his affairs, and with a total of £300 and no prospects of further income, went to live in the Sahara. His bemused friends held him a farewell party. They all agreed he would be back in six weeks; he stayed in the Sahara for seven years.|$|E

Kurt, who {{is aware of the}} proposal, asks his father for advice on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> He tells Kurt the story about how he met his mother when he was twenty-two, and married her six months later. While married life was not easy, he says there is nothing he would change. In [...] "The Quarterback", Burt is shown with Kurt and Carole after the death of Finn as they attempt to clean out Finn's room.

When New Directions dedicates their Nationals Show Choir Competition performance to Finn, they invite Carole and Burt to accompany them to Los Angeles for the event.|$|E
500|$|Scudder {{provides}} the additional detail that [...] "instruments {{of all kinds}} were interdicted", including any magnifying glass. After several hours Agassiz asks for a report and Scudder describes [...] "the fringed gill-arches and moveable operculum; the pores of the head, fleshy lips and lidless eyes; the lateral line, the spinous fins and forked tail; the compressed and arched body". Disappointed, Agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe [...] "the most conspicuous features of the animal" [...] and commands him to [...] "look again, look again!" [...] The mortified Scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen, {{and is able to}} report to Agassiz the following morning that [...] "the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs", which was the observation Agassiz was looking for. However, when Scudder then asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> next, Agassiz replied, [...] "Oh, look at your fish!" [...] which Scudder did for another two full days.|$|E

500|$|Days after Buckner joined Bragg, both Bragg and Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith {{began an}} {{invasion}} of Kentucky. As Bragg pushed north, his first encounter was in Buckner's home town of Munfordville. The small town was important for Union forces to hold {{if they wanted to}} maintain communication with Louisville while pressing [...] southward to Bowling Green and Nashville. A small force under the command of Col. John T. Wilder guarded the town. Though vastly outnumbered, Wilder refused requests to surrender on September 12and September 14. By September 17, however, Wilder recognized his difficult position and asked Bragg for proof of the superior numbers he claimed. In an unusual move, Wilder agreed to be blindfolded and brought to Buckner. When he arrived, he told Buckner that he (Wilder) was not a military man and had come to ask him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> Flattered, Buckner showed Wilder the strength and position of the Confederate forces, which outnumbered Wilder's men almost 5-to-1. Seeing the hopeless situation he was in, Wilder informed Buckner that he wanted to surrender. Any other course, he later explained, would be [...] "no less than willful murder." ...|$|E
500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E
500|$|Ronald D. Moore {{wrote the}} script, and pitched it {{directly}} to Roddenberry {{in a meeting}} alongside Piller and Berman. Roddenberry described that he hated the episode idea as {{he felt that the}} animosity shown by the Picard brothers would not exist at that point in the future. He said it was not Star Trek as it had no action or jeopardy. After the meeting was over, Moore asked Piller and Berman <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> and he was advised to ignore Roddenberry's comments and write the script. He never heard what happened with Roddenberry, but the script went through without any issues. Picard's family would later be mentioned once again in the 1994 film Star Trek Generations. The original idea was for Robert to die following a heart attack, but instead the writers opted to kill off both Robert and Rene off-screen in a fire. Throughout the years of The Next Generation, dozens of Jack Crusher related spec scripts had been received. The scenes in [...] "Family" [...] were taken from one submitted by Susanne Lambdin. Piller found the scenes powerful, as the episode was produced shortly after the birth of his daughter.|$|E

500|$|In New York, Michael and Dwight locate Ryan after {{discovering}} which club Ryan frequents; Ryan is {{thrilled to see}} them but appears {{to be under the}} influence of drugs though Michael and Dwight do not notice. Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan and Ryan's colleague, Troy Underbridge (Noel Petok) (who Dwight is certain is a Hobbit due to his short stature) wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they do not have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women's basketball team, who are also waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic and aggressive, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack Ryan. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks his [...] "friend Troy" [...] has a drug problem, and asks <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a wiretap and snitching on a drug dealer. [...] He then tells the camera that he has been watching The Wire but does not understand {{what is going on in}} the show.|$|E
500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew {{had a lot of time}} on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of his clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E

During that show, a salute to the popular Broadway director Joshua Logan, the two men were watching in the wings, and Sullivan asked Logan how he thought the show was doing.
