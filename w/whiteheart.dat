50|$|Building on {{his passion}} for music, Garies formed JAG in the late 1980s. JAG's {{original}} lineup for their 1990 debut, The Longest Road included guitarist J. Paul Brittain, bassist Tim Hall, drummer Chuck Connor, and Garies on lead vocals. Their 1991 follow up The Only World In Town traded McCreight for Michael Lusk and featured additional help from drummer Chris McHugh and guitarists, Jim Williams, Dale Oliver (originally of Geoff Moore's band) and Giant's Dann Huff. Produced by frequent CCM-session keyboardist Blair Masters, JAG's final album, Fire in the Temple, featured songs written by Garies, and the likes of Billy Smiley and Mark Gersmehl and performed by players Gordon Kennedy, Chris McHugh and Tommy Sims, {{all of whom were}} current or former members of the group <b>Whiteheart,</b> a band's sound to which JAG is oft-compared.|$|E
50|$|<b>Whiteheart</b> was {{pursued by}} every major Christian label until Chris Christian heard their demo and signed them to Home Sweet Home Records {{and gave them}} their first record deal. By the time they {{released}} their third album, they were selling in excess of 250,000 albums. After their self-titled debut album was released in 1982, the band suffered its first lineup change. Green left the band, saying that rock was not his style. They went on to tour with David Meece and Farrell and Farrell {{for the next two}} years, building their fan base, with Scott Douglas as Green's replacement as lead vocalist. Green continued to sing background vocals on Vital Signs, and they had their first No. 1 single, We Are His Hands, with Douglas singing the lead, and Smiley and Green singing the harmonies.|$|E
50|$|Walker B motif is a motif in most P-loop {{proteins}} situated well downstream of the A-motif. Walker et {{al reported}} the consensus sequence of this motif to be RK-x(4)-G-x(4)-LhhhhD, where R, K, G, L and D denote arginine, lysine, glycine, leucine and aspartic acid residues respectively, x represents any of the 20 standard amino acids and h denotes a hydrophobic amino acid. The consensus sequence of this motif was more recently reported by Hanson and <b>Whiteheart</b> (2005) to be hhhhDE, where E denotes a glutamate residue. The aspartate and glutamate also form {{a part of the}} DEAD/DEAH motifs found in helicases. The aspartate residue co-ordinates magnesium ions, and the glutamate is essential for ATP hydrolysis.There is considerable variability in the sequence of this motif, with the only invariant features being a negatively charged residue following a stretch of bulky, hydrophobic amino acids.|$|E
50|$|The {{village was}} named after James Rattray (1859-1938), a Stellenbosch {{businessman}} who owned a butchery in Dorp Street. He was the grandson of Scottish teacher James Rattray (c. 1795-1864) who immigrated to the Cape Colony in 1822, one of several British people recruited to the colony by Scottish missionary George Thom {{at the request of}} the governor Lord Charles Somerset. In 1902 Rattray and Rhenish missionary Jacob Weber (1856-1937), who was born in Lennep in Germany and sent to Stellenbosch in 1882, acquired a portion of the Blaauwklippen farm. The land was divided into plots and sold to coloured families, and most of the associated debt was paid off within twenty years. Street names such as Everbearing, Festival, Nared, Pajaro, Rolinda, Tiobelle, Titan, Torrey, Tribute and <b>Whiteheart</b> in the residential area are based on strawberry varieties, after the main crop grown there since 1902. Other crops grown there include beans, lettuce, potatoes and tomatoes.|$|E

Chi-Rho featured a pop rock sound {{and consisted of}} covers of various Christian music performers such as <b>Whiteheart,</b> Dogs of Peace, and Rebecca St. James. However, Børud considers his subsequent release, Shakin' the Ground, his true solo debut, {{as it was the}} first featuring original music. On this and subsequent releases, Børud adopted a Westcoast funk, r&b, and soul style, and his latest release, Stepping Up, is described as jazz pop in the vein of Steely Dan and Stevie Wonder. Other noted influences include Quincy Jones, George Duke, Earth, Wind and Fire, Prince and Toto. Børud himself stated in one interview that his influences [...] "could be a lot. Anything from Death to Yes to Steely Dan to Jason Falkner and so forth." [...] Per Albrigtsen of Østlands-Posten called Børud one of the foremost artists in the funk and soul genres. Børud has also performed for Torun Eriksen and Sofian, and collaborated with Larvik Stroband and the Oslo Gospel Choir.|$|E

40|$|Hazelnuts (Corylus aveIIana L.) are a {{very recent}} {{addition}} to commercial horticulture in New Zealand and <b>Whiteheart</b> has been selected as the primary commercial cultivar. No published information {{is available on the}} optimum temperatures needed to roast the dried nuts. An experiment was designed to investigate three different roasting treatments, blanching, light roast and full roast using a conveyer type roasting oven set at 200 °C. The roasted samples were then analysed for proximate contents and evaluated using a taste panel. The appearance, texture, flavour and overall appearance was evaluated by 63 tasters at one time. The blanched nut was appreciated for its colour but it was considered too chewy and bland in taste compared to the roasted nuts. Each one of the heat treatments gave an improved rating for all of the attributes measured. Roasting in the oven set at 200 °C for 6 minutes (full roast) was the treatment appreciated most by all tasters. Analysis of the correlation coefficients showed that the overriding impression about the hazelnuts comes from the flavour of the nut followed by its texture. The overall appearance of the nut was not highly rated by the tasters once the hazelnuts had been heat treated...|$|E

40|$|The {{intricate}} {{temporal and}} spatial regulation of membrane fusion is critical for all living organisms. Fusion of two opposing membranes occurs {{in a wide range}} of processes. These include intracellular transportation, cell-to-cell fusion and viral fusion. In all known cases, the SNARE proteins (Soluble NSF attachment protein receptors) (Sollner et al., 1993; <b>Whiteheart</b> et al., 1993) have been shown to be required for vesicular membrane fusion within cells and sufficient to drive membrane fusion in vitro (Nickel et al., 1999; Parlati et al., 1999; Weber et al., 1998). While SNAREs combine in specific combinations to drive highly specific membrane fusion, it is clear that SNARE proteins do not act independently to regulate the entire fusion process. Many regulatory proteins from different families have been identified that interact with individual SNARE proteins and SNARE complexes, yet the precise role of many of these remains unclear. One such group of regulatory proteins is the Sec 1 /Munc 18 (SM) family. Sec 1 proteins are likely to be critical players in membrane trafficking. My work has focused on the role of the yeast Sec 1 p in post-Golgi secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To analyze Sec 1 p function in vitro, I have utilized a well-characterized SNARE-mediated membrane fusion assay. For this application, conditions were optimized to allow for specific protein-protein interactions to be tested. Conditions for expression and purification of the previously elusive recombinant Sec 1 p are documented. In addition, an overexpressing Sec 1 p yeast strain was generated. Sec 1 p interactions with SNARE proteins that mediate post-Golgi secretion were then tested. I found that recombinant Sec 1 p binds strongly to the t-SNARE complex (Sso 1 p;Sec 9 c) as well as to the fully assembled ternary-SNARE complex (Sso 1 p;Sec 9 c/Snc 2 p), and also weakly to free Sso 1 p. I tested the ability of Sec 1 p to regulate fusion in the fusion assay. Concentration dependent stimulation of membrane fusion is observed when Sec 1 p is associated with the SNARE proteins. The binding and fusion data strongly argue that Sec 1 p directly stimulates SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. With this new information, specific binding modes of neuronal-Sec 1 are currently being investigated further in yeast, Drosophila and mammalian SNARE systems...|$|E
