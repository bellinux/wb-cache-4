5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the port}} of Monterey, her captain was {{supplied}} with wood and water. When ready to sail he asked permission of Governor Borica to land eleven English sailors who had secretly boarded his vessel at Botany Bay, Australia. The Governor refused his consent. It {{was a violation of}} Spanish law to land any foreigners. The shrewd Yankee captain, however, that night forced the sailors at the point of a pistol to go ashore. He then speedily put to sea. Borica <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> Making the best of the situation, however, he put the men to work as carpenters and blacksmiths.|$|E
25|$|Once, while Parvati {{wanted to}} take a bath, there were no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally {{entering}} the house. Hence she created an image of a boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body, and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper and severed the boy's head with his trident. When Parvati came out and saw her son's lifeless body, she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> She demanded that Shiva restore Ganesha's life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant's head to Ganesha's body, thus giving rise to the elephant headed deity.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> with Marshall's position, for {{he wanted the}} President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not. Historians mostly agree that {{the framers of the}} Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court {{to have some sort of}} judicial review; Marshall made their goals operational. Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution. Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or act of a president unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to {{take her}} {{frustration}} out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

500|$|The elder Lajoie, {{who worked}} as a {{teamster}} and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias [...] "Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called [...] "Slugging Cabby." [...] "When I told my father I had decided to take the job he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined {{to give it a try}} at least one season", Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname [...] "Larry" [...] from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.|$|E

500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to listen to {{what they had to say}} but <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry,</b> so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E
500|$|Ken Gormley, {{author of}} The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals {{in his book}} that Clinton {{narrowly}} escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During {{his visit to the}} Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while {{he was on his way}} to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED). According to officials, the IED was large enough to [...] "blow up the entire presidential motorcade". Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge. This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila. Once more, the word [...] "wedding" [...] was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt. Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry,</b> as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high. Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag. Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base. The president was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden. Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Genie moved in, Marilyn {{taught her}} to direct her frustrations outward by {{generally}} [...] "having a fit." [...] Because Genie sought compliments on her appearance Marilyn began to paint Genie's fingernails and told her {{she did not look}} good when she scratched herself, and when situations came up which especially upset Genie Marilyn tried to verbally deescalate her. Genie gradually gained more control over her responses and with prompting could verbally express frustration, although she never entirely ceased to have tantrums or engage in self-harm, and on occasion could indicate her level of anger; depending on whether she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> or merely frustrated, she either vigorously shook one finger or loosely waved her hand.|$|E

2500|$|Cost overruns {{became an}} issue on the site in 1963. As work on the fountains progressed, rising costs forced the Hanna Trust to shift $200,000 ($ in [...] dollars) from the {{proposed}} maintenance endowment {{and apply it to}} design and construction costs. In June, the city council discovered that plans for the convention center had failed to include landscaping costs. A request for nearly $372,000 ($ in [...] dollars) was made for brickwork, sidewalks, stonework, and topsoil. The city council <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> that these costs had been overlooked, but approved the request on July 2 by a vote of 28-to-4. The council was forced to sell land at Cooley Farms (the city's juvenile work farm) to pay for the landscaping.|$|E
2500|$|Collins {{started the}} 2006–07 season as first choice defender at Sunderland, but was dropped four games {{into the season}} after being booed by {{a section of the}} crowd {{following}} a mistake in the previous game against Plymouth Argyle. Collins later regained his place following the arrival of manager Roy Keane and won another championship medal come the end of the season. On 15 December Collins scored a late last minute goal against Aston Villa which would have led to the Black Cats victory but referee Steve Bennett denied the goal for a foul on Scott Carson, the foul was not apparent and the goal should have stood. Manager Roy Keane <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> at the decision and said that Bennett had cheated Sunderland and went as far as to say [...] "the players deserve better." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash recounted how {{at first}} (after the {{incident}} of the Golden Calf), God pronounced a decree against Aaron, as [...] says, [...] "The Lord <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> with Aaron to have destroyed ( [...] , le-hashmid) him." [...] And Rabbi Joshua of Siknin {{taught in the}} name of Rabbi Levi that [...] "destruction" [...] ( [...] , hashmadah) means extinction of offspring, as in [...] which says, [...] "And I destroyed ( [...] , va-ashmid) his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath." [...] But, as Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught, prayer effects half atonement. So when Moses prayed on Aaron's behalf, God annulled half the decree. Aaron's two sons Nadab and Abihu died, and Aaron's two other sons remained. Thus [...] says, [...] "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: ‘Take Aaron and his sons'" [...] (implying that they were to be saved from death).|$|E
