500|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} George Stade {{said that}} Shikasta [...] "forces {{us to think}} about... what we are, how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> way and where we are going", but complained that the book is filled with [...] "false hopes", and that the fate of humankind relies on [...] "theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations". When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing [...] "both indicts and exculpates" [...] them, implying that humanity is bad, {{but it is not}} their fault. While Stade complemented Lessing on the book's satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said [...] "have the eerie beauty of ancient Gnostic texts", he [...] "disapprove" [...] of the novel as a whole, but added, [...] "that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it".|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} The Making of the Madcap Laughs, Jones states that [...] "when Dave {{came to me}} and said that Syd wanted him and Roger to do the {{remaining}} parts of the album, I acquiesced". Roger Waters and David Gilmour were in the process of completing Pink Floyd's Ummagumma album when they got involved with The Madcap Laughs that July and helped Barrett finish his album − [...] "in a two-day sprint", according to Pink Floyd biographer Rick Sanders. [...] "We had very little time," [...] Gilmour recalled in a May 2003 interview. [...] "Syd was very difficult, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> very frustrated feeling: Look, it's your fucking career, mate. Why don't you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cola Song" [...] {{was written}} by J Balvin, Andrew Frampton, Breyan Isaac, Thomas Joseph Rozdilsky and Andreas Schuller, while {{production}} was handled by the Colombian reggaeton performer along with Rozdilsky and Schuller. While featuring guest vocals from J Balvin, the song incorporates elements from Inna's previous collaboration with Schuller on [...] "Piñata 2014" [...] (2013). Musically, the recording is of the electro house genre and portrays a [...] "subtle blend" [...] of electronic and Latin music. According to German music website Dance Charts, [...] "Cola Song" [...] features [...] "typical Romania-House" [...] sounds, alongside offbeat-bass and [...] "natural instruments" [...] like a saxophone. Bradely Stern from MuuMuse wrote that the song incorporates a [...] "horn-heavy" [...] breakdown reminiscent of American singer Jason Derulo's [...] "Talk Dirty" [...] (2013). During the lyrics, Inna sings, [...] "We got that Coca-Cola bottle shape, shape, shape. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> sugar, do you wanna taste, taste, taste?", which {{was associated with the}} singer's ended collaboration with Pepsi.|$|E

[...] "Bort things dear and sold 'em cheap, and played the 'ankey-pankey jackass with everything <b>we</b> <b>got.</b> <b>That's</b> what I mean 'e's done, Ann." [...] He repeated this last sentence {{with the addition of}} violent adverbs.|$|R

500|$|... "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Long and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, [...] "we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So when everybody knew how to draw the horse and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> out of the way, they could animate the horse acting." [...] Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I {{think most of us}} went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E
500|$|It Was Written {{has been}} credited, along with Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995), with helping usher {{in the era}} of the mafioso rap. According to writer Sam Chennault, while the hip hop subgenre would [...] "run out of steam quickly, this release is a gem." [...] Chennault also {{discussed}} the significance of It Was Written during the period of its release, stating [...] "after mastering stark street corner realism on Illmatic, Nas delivered a loose concept album that was, at the time, groundbreaking in its scope, approach and execution." [...] According to rapper Young Noble, a close friend of Tupac Shakur, the song [...] "I Gave You Power" [...] served as the main inspiration for Shakur's [...] "" [...] (1996). American hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco has cited It Was Written as his favorite album and his primary source of inspiration. Fiasco has stated that he based his debut album Food & Liquor (2006) on the conceptual style and [...] "moods" [...] of It Was Written. When asked of his musical influences in an interview with AllHipHop.com, Fiasco stated [...] "You know I really tried to go back and recreate [...] It Was Written, you know what I'm saying like that? [...] It Was Written and then I would play my album, and it was like, ‘Do we got [...] record, do <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> record?’" [...] When asked in an interview with NobodySmiling.com about why he is comfortable admitting the album as a source of inspiration, Fiasco stated: ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{speech of}} Artie Kipps is a careful {{rendering}} of the pronunciation of the English language as Wells first learned it. Kipps never masters another way of speaking, and after much effort he reverts to the manner of his upbringing: [...] "'Speckylated it!' said Kipps, with an illustrative flourish of the arm that failed to illustrate. 'Bort things dear and sold 'em cheap, and played the 'ankey-pankey jackass with everything <b>we</b> <b>got.</b> <b>That's</b> what I mean 'e's done, Ann.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|On {{a flight}} home, Carter learned of Kennedy's death and was devastated. A {{passenger}} {{on the plane}} said, [...] "Well, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> son-of-a-bitch, didn't we?" [...] Carter responded, [...] "Who are you talking about?" [...] The passenger said, [...] "You know damn well who I'm talking about", to which Carter responded by saying [...] "You're just a son-of-a-bitch", and then punching the passenger in the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|T.I. {{was also}} {{able to work with}} fellow Atlanta rapper, Outkast's André 3000 for the first time after years of trying to collaborate: [...] "We've been trying to put this {{particular}} collaboration together since the King album. Every album since King I've called Andre and been like 'Hey, I'm working on an album, let's get together.' And he'd say 'Okay, let's see what <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> makes sense.' And we've met a handful of times. This {{is the first time that}} it ... came together. I'm extremely proud, honored, and privileged." [...] And while T.I. admits that André 3000 out shined on [...] "Sorry," [...] he’s not mad: [...] "He did get down on me on my record, I can’t front," [...] laughs Tip. [...] "But to me I’m honored and it’s a pleasure that he would even choose my record to do that on." [...] The song was co-produced by former Grand Hustle intern Sir Clef alongside Jazze Pha, the latter of whom has helmed tracks for T.I. such as [...] "Chooz You" [...] and [...] "Let's Get Away".|$|E

6000|$|... "Curious, ain't it?" [...] said Poney, puffing, on {{the next}} track. [...] "You an' me, if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> man under our bumpers, we'd work him into red waste an' not know what we'd done; but-up there--with the steam hummin' in his boiler that awful quiet way..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, Molly," [...] said Tom, the Coastguardsman, {{stroking}} his bushy beard, [...] "the same idea {{has been running}} in my head, {{as well as in}} Dick's, ever since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> letter from Jim, telling us of the beauty of his new home, and urging us all to emigrate.

6000|$|... "Sounds {{like a big}} snow-slide," [...] said Festing, raising {{himself in}} his bunk. [...] "Won't harm us; shack's {{on top of the}} ridge and we're safer here than {{anywhere}} else." [...] He stopped and listened to the swelling roar and then resumed: [...] "I'm glad <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> frame braced. It's a big slide and will probably come down the gully near the bridge. They're going to snowshed that piece of track and we'll haul out the posts if we can't get on with the other job." ...|$|E
60|$|Long before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to <b>that,</b> {{before even}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{to the great}} high road, we should have hints from the stone cabin in the nape of the pass--it would be gone or wonderfully changed--from the very goats upon the rocks, from the little hut by the rough bridge of stone, that a mighty {{difference}} {{had come to the}} world of men.|$|R

6000|$|Sant' Iddio! What agonies I {{suffered}} ere the {{sun rose}} {{up out of the}} sea to flood us with his winter glory!

60|$|In {{the evening}} we {{returned}} with our precious burden to Cambridge, and I {{think that we}} might both of us have given away all the sleep <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> night and not have been much the poorer. At daybreak Leo arrived in my room in a dressing-gown, and suggested that we should at once proceed to business. I scouted the idea as showing an unworthy curiosity. The chest had waited twenty years, I said, so {{it could very well}} continue to wait until after breakfast. Accordingly at nine--an unusually sharp nine--we breakfasted; and so occupied was I with my own thoughts that I regret to state that I put a piece of bacon into Leo's tea in mistake for a lump of sugar. Job, too, to whom the contagion of excitement had, of course, spread, managed to break the handle off my Sèvres china tea-cup, the identical one I believe that Marat had been drinking from just before he was stabbed in his bath.|$|E
