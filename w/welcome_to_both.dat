6000|$|One {{morning in}} the month of July, when there was {{actually}} sunshine in Lamb Court, and the two gentlemen who occupied the third-floor chambers there in partnership, were engaged, as their custom was, over their pipes, and their manuscripts, and their Times newspaper, behold a fresh sunshine burst into their room in the person of a young Clive, with a bronzed face, and a yellow beard and mustachios, and those bright cheerful eyes, the sight of which was always so <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> of us. [...] "What, Clive! What, the young one! What, Benjamin!" [...] shout Pendennis and Warrington. Clive had obtained a very high place indeed in the latter's affections, so much so, that if I could have found it in my heart to be jealous of such a generous brave fellow, I might have grudged him his share of Warrington's regard. He blushed up with pleasure to see us again. Pidgeon, our boy, introduced him with a jubilant countenance; and Flanagan, the laundress, came smirking out of the bedroom, eager to get a nod of recognition from him, and bestow a smile of welcome upon everybody's favourite, Clive.|$|E
60|$|James of Scotland and John of Bedford sat {{together}} in the twilight {{of a long and}} weary day, spent by the one in standing like a statue at the head of his deceased friend {{as a part of the}} pageant of the lying-in-state in the chapel, whither multitudes had crowded throughout the day to see the 'mighty victor, mighty lord, lie low on his funeral couch;' the nobles gazing with a certain silent and bitter satisfaction at him who had not only broken the pride of their country, but had with his iron hand repressed their own private exactions, while the poor and the peasants openly bewailed him as the father and the friend who had stood between them and their harsh feudal lords. By the other, the hours had passed in the press of toil and perplexity that had fallen on him as the yet unaccredited representative of English power in France, and in writing letters to those persons at home from whom he must derive his authority. The hour of rest and relaxation was <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>both,</b> though they chiefly spent it each leaning back in his chair in silence.|$|E

I left Ruthven (it's hardly {{necessary}} to remark) with much greater satisfaction than I {{had come to}} it; but whether I missed my way in the deserts, or whether my companions failed me, I soon found myself alone. This was a predicament very disagreeable; for I never understood this horrid country or savage people, and the last stroke of the Prince's withdrawal had made us of the Irish more unpopular than ever. I was reflecting on my poor chances, when I saw another horseman on the hill, whom I supposed at first {{to have been a}} phantom, the news of his death in the very front at Culloden being current in the army generally. This was the Master of Ballantrae, my Lord Durrisdeer's son, a young nobleman of the rarest gallantry and parts, and equally designed by nature to adorn a Court and to reap laurels in the field. Our meeting was the more <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>both,</b> as {{he was one of the}} few Scots who had used the Irish with consideration, and as he might now be of very high utility in aiding my escape.

60|$|CRAIGENGELT {{set forth}} on his mission so soon as his {{equipage}} was complete, prosecuted his journey with all diligence, and accomplished his commission {{with all the}} dexterity for which bucklaw had given him credit. As he arrived with credentials from Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw, he was extremely <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> ladies; {{and those who are}} prejudiced in favour of a new acquaintance can, for a time at least, discover excellencies in his very faults and perfections in his deficiencies. Although both ladies were accustomed to good society, yet, being pre-determined to find out an agreeable and well-behaved gentleman in Mr. Hayston's friend, they succeeded wonderfully in imposing on themselves. It is true that Craigengelt was now handsomely dressed, and that was a point of no small consequence. But, independent of outward show, his blackguard impudence of address was construed into honourable bluntness becoming his supposed military profession; his hectoring passed for courage, and his sauciness for wit. Lest, however, any one should think this a violation of probability, we must add, in fairness to the two ladies, that their discernment was greatly blinded, and their favour propitiated, by the opportune arrival of Captain Craigengelt in the moment when they were longing for a third hand to make a party at tredrille, in which, as in all games, whether of chance or skill, that worthy person was a great proficient.|$|E
6000|$|When Aunt Bernstein came to Castlewood, her {{relatives}} there, more, I think, {{on account of}} her own force of character, imperiousness, and sarcastic wit, than from their desire to possess her money, were accustomed to pay her {{a great deal of}} respect and deference, which she accepted as her due. She expected the same treatment from the new Countess, whom she was prepared to greet with special good-humour. The match had been of her making. [...] "As you, you silly creature, would not have the heiress," [...] she said, [...] "I was determined she should not go out of the family," [...] and she laughingly told of many little schemes for bringing the marriage about. She had given the girl a coronet and her nephew a hundred thousand pounds. Of course she should be <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> of them. She was delighted with the little Countess's courage and spirit in routing the Dowager and Lady Fanny. Almost always pleased with pretty people on her first introduction to them, Madame Bernstein raffled of her niece Lydia's bright eyes and lovely little figure. The marriage was altogether desirable. The old man was an obstacle, to be sure, and his talk and appearance somewhat too homely. But he will be got rid of. He is old and in delicate health. [...] "He will want to go to America, or perhaps farther," [...] says the Baroness, with a shrug. [...] "As for the child, she had great fire and liveliness, and a Cherokee manner which is not without its charm," [...] said the pleased old Baroness. [...] "Your brother had it--so have you, Master George! Nous la formerons, cette petite. Eugene wants character and vigour, but he is a finished gentleman, and between us we shall make the little savage perfectly presentable." [...] In this way we discoursed on the second afternoon as we journeyed towards Castlewood. We lay at the King's Arms at Bagshot the first night, where the Baroness was always received with profound respect, and thence drove post to Hexton, where she had written to have my lord's horses in waiting for her; but these were not forthcoming at the inn, and after a couple of hours we were obliged to proceed with our Bagshot horses to Castlewood.|$|E

40|$|From time to time, we publish “theme issues ” of On Tap. In the past, we’ve {{explored}} {{topics such}} as conservation, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and community self help. Obviously, this sort of endeavor requires {{a great deal of}} foresight and planning. Other times, though, a theme emerges as the stories come together. That’s exactly what happened with this issue. The idea of “smart growth ” can not only be found in the cover story, but as a concept—either implicit or explicit—in several other articles as well. Water rights and water as a valuable resource are also topics that appear in more than one article. I’m pleased to welcome two new graphic designers to the National Environmental Services Center team. Chris Metzgar joined us at the beginning of September. His technical drawings complement the latest Tech Brief, found in the center of this magazine. Chris will work primarily with the National Environmental Training Center for Small Communities, one of our partner organizations. This is actually the second issue of On Tap featuring design and artwork by Julie Black. Julie started work here in May and will work on National Drinking Water Clearinghouse publications. A warm <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> Chris and Julie. On a sad note: The terrible events of September 11, 2001, occurred while we were finishing this issue of On Tap.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} two Christian churches {{in the north of}} Sweden in a small village called Stöde. In Stöde there are about 3000 people and the village has been a refugee center since the year 2010. At first the new people had some {{difficulties}} to get closed to the people from Stöde. The two Christian churches started up some Swedish education and became a meeting point for the immigrants.   In my study I look fore if the two Christian churches can {{be a good way to}} integration. I also look if the two Christian churches will get some things out of the work with the immigrants. I have study the time from 2010 to 2015. In the study I interviewed one priest from the Swedish church and one pastor from the church of Euqumenia, Bethel. Both churches exist in Stöde. The immigrants come from different places and many are Muslims but it`s no problem because everyone is <b>welcomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> of the Christian churches. Perhaps is it so that the immigrants make the small village of Stöde alive again. And the both churches in Stöde has made a good work and tried to make the immigrants integrated in Sweden...|$|R
