5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry was {{the fourth}} child {{in a family of}} six. He grew up in the north St. Louis {{neighborhood}} known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry <b>William</b> <b>Berry</b> (1895–1987), was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980), was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.|$|E

500|$|In 1759 the Governor of Guernsey, John West, had the priory {{destroyed}} {{to prevent}} French forces from capturing the island during the Seven Years' War. In {{the early nineteenth}} century, a farmhouse was built on Lihou, and the island was listed as being owned by Eleazar le Marchant, who held the post of lieutenant bailiff of Guernsey. Eleazar made an ultimately unsuccessful attempt, in 1815, to suppress the seaweed industry based around Lihou. In a book published in the same year, <b>William</b> <b>Berry</b> noted {{the presence of an}} [...] "iron hook of a gate hinge" [...] on some rocks, approximately three miles out at sea from Lihou, along with the remains of old roads, and surmised that Lihou may have been significantly larger in the past but that the sea had eroded a considerable portion. Through the remainder of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth century, the island changed hands between a succession of owners including James Priaulx in 1863, Arthur Clayfield in 1883, and Colonel Hubert de Lancey Walters in 1906.|$|E
500|$|Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography {{suggests}} {{it was to}} be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, since Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and map-making. However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On 26 January 1598, the States-General, the parliament of the United Provinces, showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On 6 June he lodged a second application, but he died in Amsterdam almost immediately afterwards. His wife was granted administration of his estate in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, because Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate pension of 50 florins on 9 April 1599. Molyneux apparently had no surviving family, and the English globe-making industry died with him. No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by Robert Morden and <b>William</b> <b>Berry,</b> and by Joseph Moxon. However, over 40years after Molyneux's death, William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were [...] "yet in being, great and small ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and beyond Seas)".|$|E
