5|$|From {{the launch}} of the {{original}} iPhone to the iPhone 4S, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that <b>was</b> <b>taller,</b> but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} shared traits {{with the}} dodo, its closest relative, such as size and {{features in the}} skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it <b>was</b> <b>taller</b> and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.|$|E

As a child, Wiggins was {{a fan of the}} Los Angeles Dodgers, and he looked up to Maury Wills, a Dodgers player known for stealing bases. Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California; the school was also the alma mater of baseball star Jackie Robinson. Gib Bodet, a scout for the Montreal Expos, noticed Wiggins in high school. Wiggins <b>was</b> , <b>taller</b> than a typical infielder.

5|$|For {{the next}} four years, Washington worked {{surveying}} land in Western Virginia and for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. He was hard to miss; at over six feet, he <b>was</b> <b>taller</b> than most of his contemporaries. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to work diligently {{over the next three}} years at his new profession. He continued to survey professionally for two more years, mostly in Frederick County, before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.|$|E

25|$|Potez 63.11:Because {{the pilot}} {{needed to be}} seated above the observer, the {{fuselage}} <b>was</b> <b>taller,</b> which resulted in degraded top speed and manoeuvrability. As a result, the 63.11 proved very vulnerable, despite being protected with some armour and basic self-sealing coating over the fuel tanks. As a secondary light bomber capability {{was part of the}} requirements (though it was rarely if ever used), the fuselage accommodated a tiny bomb bay, carrying up to eight 10kg-class bombs. This bomb bay was replaced by an additional fuel tank on late examples. Additionally, two 50kg-class bombs could be carried on hardpoints under the inner wings. Frontal armament was originally one, then three MAC 1934s under the nose, and many 63.11s were equipped with the same additional guns in wing gondolas as the 631s.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Who {{producer}} Barry Letts {{offered the}} part of Sarah Jane to actress April Walker, who accepted the role and was duly contracted by the BBC. During rehearsals for The Time Warrior, {{it became clear to}} Jon Pertwee and Letts that the two leads had little rapport and were physically mis-matched (Pertwee demanded the part be recast, because he said he would not play opposite an actress who <b>was</b> <b>taller</b> than he). Letts therefore released Walker from her contract (though she was still paid in full for season 11). Letts began a second batch of auditions and saw Elisabeth Sladen after a recommendation from fellow BBC producer Bill Slater, who had twice cast the actress recently in separate episodes of Z-Cars. Sladen performed her audition alongside actor Stephen Thorne and after impressing Letts, he arranged for her to meet Pertwee before any decisions were made. Pertwee stood behind Sladen and gave a 'thumbs-up' to Letts who then offered her the role.|$|E

Such an ordering {{is comprised of}} some adjacent pairwise relations {{that are necessary to}} the establishment of the ordering (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Dick, Dick <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam), and some remote relations that are deducible (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam). Except for unusually fast responses to test sentences beginning with an end term, reaction time was a monotonic decreasing function of remoteness; the more remote the shorter the reaction time. This result contradicts several current models of how meaningful information is stored. First, it contranicts any model which argues that subjects do not store deducible information. Information pertaining to the deducible remote pairs is stored along with the information that was actually presented. Second, it contradicts any model which describes the form of the stored information in terms of inter-item associations. A model which can account for the result is presented. (Author...|$|R

25|$|Then, a {{rainstorm}} strikes the city, threatening {{to cancel the}} game for which Juror 7 has tickets. Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at the movies, {{because he could not}} recall it in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which he does, with difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was more than half a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body. Next, Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who <b>was</b> <b>taller</b> than they, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming.|$|E
25|$|This {{traditional}} schooner design had {{a number}} of drawbacks. The shallow hull did not, in fact, contribute significantly to speed, and the wide stern design actually hindered fast sailing. The ships shallowness of hull gave them a high center of gravity that made them prone to capsizing and sinking in heavy seas, often with significant or total loss of life among their crews. The foremast rising to the same height as the mainmast often meant either that the jib when raised {{to the top of the}} foremast caused an inefficient, asymmetrical sail pattern, or that the upper parts of the foremast were left unused; having a foremast that <b>was</b> <b>taller</b> than necessary added extra expense to the cost of the ships construction and also meant that she had an unnecessary amount of weight aloft, making her less stable and more prone to dangerous rolling and capsizing. The large jib also created problems, moving the sails center of effort too far forward when the schooner shortened sail and the mainsail was reefed, making the ship harder to handle. Moreover, handling the large jib required crew members to work on the bowsprit in bad weather, a dangerous practice that resulted in men being swept overboard and drowned.|$|E
