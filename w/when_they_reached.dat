By three years, infants move farther away from their mothers. By four to six years, chimps are weaned and infancy ends.|$|R
25|$|Though {{religious}} freedom is {{allowed in the}} Syrian Arab Republic, all citizens of Syria including Christians, {{are subject to the}} Shari'a-based personal status laws regulating child custody, inheritance, and adoption.

5|$|Malmö FF has a rich European legacy with {{participation}} in UEFA competitions since 1964. The club's best European performance {{was in the}} 1978–79 season, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the finals of the UEFA Champions League (then European Champion Clubs' Cup), making Malmö FF the only Nordic club to have reached this far in any European competition.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} overall size and crest size also {{corresponds}} to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, {{it seems that the}} large crests only developed in males <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> their large, adult size, making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.|$|E
5|$|With the {{uncertainty}} {{caused by the}} Utah War, the Church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to Saint Joseph, Missouri, after which they went by riverboat to Florence, where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough mountain men fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a young woman from the company to stay with him, which the tired woman agreed to do. (William Atkin recalled another {{version of the story}} in which two young women married two mountain men.) The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not available <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Green River. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants.|$|E

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|Bonventre {{was called}} to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He {{was picked up by}} Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> their destination. The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E

5|$|In August, Ibrahim renewed the {{offensive}} {{and he sent}} a group of regular soldiers down the coast and they reached Kariopoli before they retreated.

The Egyptians and the Ottomans were forced to retreat with significant losses. This was the last time Mani was invaded during the War for Independence, as Greece was liberated in 1828.|$|E

The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp.

Rajaji also had a code of conduct for the volunteers under which consumption of coffee and tobacco products, and smoking were prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's 'A' Company {{suffered}} a similar fate, the officer commanding was wounded crossing the start line, {{and at the}} same time every member of the 2nd Platoon was killed or wounded.

The company second in command who had been bringing up the rear, reached the village and found the 3rd Platoon only had nine men left but they had managed to clear the village Château and the 1st Platoon had cleared its grounds.|$|E
5|$|The survey {{continued}} {{to the south}} in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known Megatherium by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him {{to be like a}} giant version of the armour on local armadillos.

Nonetheless, he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner-up finish in 2006. During the 2005–06, when the team compiled a 22–11 overall (8–8, Big Ten) record, he led them to their first national ranking in eight years <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the #20 position. Despite his successes, the team never won a Big Ten Championship and never made the NCAA tournament, which led to his firing after six seasons.|$|E
5|$|When Malmö FF {{was founded}} in 1910, there was no {{established}} official league system in Swedish football. The club therefore competed in two cup competitions: the nationally-organised Svenska Mästerskapet, and Distriktsmästerskapet, the regional championship of Scania. The team's best performances during these early years were <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Svenska Mästerskapet quarter-finals in 1920, and the Distriktsmästerskapet final twice, in 1916 and 1918. The club {{would go on to}} win Distriktsmästerskapet 27 times before the competition was abolished in 1966.|$|E
