5|$|In the sonnet, {{the poet}} <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> {{why he has}} stopped {{showering}} his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are {{a response to the}} infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} of Persian {{imperial}} rule in the region (c. 550–330 BCE), the Qedarites exercised control over the desert areas bordering Egypt and Israel and the traffic related to Arabian incense trade upon which Gaza depended. Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE) <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> {{their presence in the}} northern Sinai near the Egyptian border where they may have been engaged by the Achaemenids, the Persian imperial authorities, to keep that border secure as well as their control of the city of Gaza.|$|E

It is possible that she worked at Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire. She is critical of cookery books written by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.|$|E

5|$|Professor Nathan Katz <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> {{the analogy}} of a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
5|$|Shelley <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> her {{overwhelming}} {{happiness in}} Italy and her sadness {{at having to}} leave it.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E
5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, {{and points to the}} influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 {{in the middle of the}} piece.|$|E
5|$|According to Glajar, this is {{the world}} of the narrator's mother, who <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> her sicknesses in her letters in the hope of keeping her {{daughter}} emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father {{was a member of the}} SS (as were Müller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timişoara, where the main characters attend college—between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> {{the possibility that the}} Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Five {{references}} in Eusebius' Historia Ecclesiastica speak to Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he describes Philip visiting a church on Easter Eve and being denied entry by the presiding bishop {{because he had}} not yet confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed. At 6.36.3, he <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> letters from the Christian theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two references are quotations or paraphrases of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, a contemporary of Philip (he held the patriarchate from 247 to 265). At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that Alexander Severus (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> {{the cathedral}}: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{smuggling}} of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century Byzantine historian Menander Protector <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> how the Sogdians attempted {{to establish a}} direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istämi, the Göktürk ruler of the Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings {{for the privilege of}} traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 102 {{is one of}} the 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is one of the}} Fair Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of {{seemingly}} connected sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.|$|E
5|$|The rigors {{and rewards}} of pioneer {{life on the}} prairie {{are the subject of}} Giants in the Earth by Ole Rolvaag and the Little House series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Small-town life is portrayed grimly by Sinclair Lewis in the novel Main Street, and more gently and affectionately by Garrison Keillor in his tales of Lake Wobegon. St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> the social insecurities and {{aspirations}} of the young city in stories such as Winter Dreams and The Ice Palace (published in Flappers and Philosophers).
