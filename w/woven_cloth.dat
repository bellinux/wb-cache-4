5|$|A {{decorative}} pattern, {{designed in}} 1917 by Matrena Markevich, is {{displayed on the}} hoist of the flag (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus.

25|$|To this day, {{the most}} {{traditional}} huipils {{are made with}} hand <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> on a back strap loom. However, the introduction of commercial fabric made this costly and many indigenous women stopped making this fabric, or making simpler versions.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{protective}} respiratory equipment {{can be traced}} back as far as the first century, when Pliny the Elder (circa A.D. 23-79) described using animal bladder skins to protect workers in Roman mines from red lead oxide dust.

500|$|In medieval Europe, purple, violet, murrey {{and similar}} colors were {{produced}} by dyeing wool with woad or indigo in the fleece and then piece-dyeing the <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> with red dyes, either the common madder or the luxury dyes kermes and cochineal. [...] Madder could also produce purples when used with alum. [...] Brazilwood also gave purple shades with vitriol (sulfuric acid) or potash.|$|E
500|$|Textiles may be dyed as raw fibre (dyed in the fleece or dyed in the wool), as {{spun yarn}} (dyed in the hank or yarn-dyed), or after weaving (piece-dyed). [...] Mordants often leave residue in wool fibre {{that makes it}} {{difficult}} to spin, so wool was generally dyed after spinning, as yarn or <b>woven</b> <b>cloth.</b> Indigo, however, requires no mordant, and cloth manufacturers in medieval England often dyed wool in the fleece with the indigo-bearing plant woad and then dyed the cloth again after weaving to produce deep blues, browns, reds, purples, blacks, and tawnies.|$|E

Although SASR parade, working and field uniforms are generally {{the same as those}} used {{by the rest of the}} Australian Army, special uniforms—including black coveralls—are used depending on the tactical situation. Qualified SASR members wear a sandy-coloured beret with a metal, gold and silver badge, depicting the sword Excalibur, with flames issuing upwards from below the hilt, with a scroll across the front of blade inscribed with the regimental motto [...] "Who Dares Wins", on a black shield. This differs from the British Special Air Service, which wears a <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> cap badge of the same design. SAS 'Ibis'-style parachute wings (rounded at the bottom and straight on top) are worn on the right shoulder on general duty, ceremonial and mess dress uniforms only. A garter blue lanyard is worn. Members of the regiment often dispense with rank, use first names, and wear long hair and beards on operations or when in the field.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have listened}} carefully, {{and there is}} only one name that will epitomize you. I shall call you that name. You are machine-breakers. Do you know what a machine-breaker is? Let me tell you. In the eighteenth century, in England, men and women <b>wove</b> <b>cloth</b> on hand-looms in their own cottages. It was a slow, clumsy, and costly way of <b>weaving</b> <b>cloth,</b> this cottage system of manufacture. Along came the steam-engine and {{labor-saving}} machinery. A thousand looms assembled in a large factory, and driven by a central engine <b>wove</b> <b>cloth</b> vastly more cheaply than could the cottage weavers on their hand-looms. Here in the factory was combination, and before it competition faded away. The men and women who had worked the hand-looms for themselves now went into the factories and worked the machine-looms, not for themselves, but for the capitalist owners. Furthermore, little children went to work on the machine-looms, at lower wages, and displaced the men. This made hard times for the men. Their standard of living fell. They starved. And they said it was all the fault of the machines. Therefore, they proceeded to break the machines. They did not succeed, and they were very stupid.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{mechanization}} dramatically {{decreased the}} cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> still could not equal the quality of hand woven Indian cloth, {{in part due to}} the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high tread counts. [...] However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry.|$|E
2500|$|Though early [...] "cities" [...] {{appeared}} at Jericho and Catal Huyuk around 6000 BCE, the first civilizations did not emerge until around 3000 BCE in Egypt and Mesopotamia. These cultures {{gave birth to}} the invention of the wheel, mathematics, bronze-working, sailing boats, the pottery wheel, <b>woven</b> <b>cloth,</b> construction of monumental buildings, and writing. Writing developed independently and at different times in five areas of the world: [...] Egypt (c. 3200 BCE), India (c. 3200 BCE), Mesopotamia (c. 3000 BCE), China (c. 1600 BCE), and Mesoamerica (c. 600 BCE).|$|E
2500|$|Both penannular and pseudo-penannular {{brooches}} {{feature a}} long pin attached by its {{head to a}} ring; the pin can move freely around the ring {{as far as the}} terminals, which are close together. [...] In the true penannular type, the ring is not closed; there is a gap between the terminals wide enough for the pin to pass through. In the pseudo-penannular type, the ring is closed, but there are still two separately defined terminals, which are joined by a further element. The penannular type is a simple and efficient way of fastening loosely <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> (where the pin will not leave a permanent hole), but the pseudo-penannular type is notably less efficient.|$|E

2500|$|Shirts {{are made}} of <b>woven</b> <b>cloth.</b> The natural fibers {{used in the past}} were cotton (the most frequent), linen (the oldest), ramie, wool or silk. Nowadays, {{artificial}} fibers such as polyester or polyester blends are often used, due to their low cost, despite being considered by most shirtmakers the poorest material, owing to less softness and breathability. However, while high quality cotton shirts can survive with care a few decades, a polyester/cotton blend may be used in more demanding environments. Linen produces a cool fabric that wrinkles heavily, and is mostly used in light summer shirts. [...] Cotton is therefore the standard material for all but the cheapest shirts. Silk is occasionally worn, though it is hot to wear and has a marked sheen.|$|E
2500|$|Workers {{discovered}} a cavity {{in one of}} the walls when the castle was being partially demolished in 1815; this contained four small urns, a painted drinking glass and a large jaw bone, possibly of an ox. [...] Two of the urns had handles and all were tightly closed with shreds or trimmings of <b>woven</b> <b>cloth.</b> [...] One of the urns contained the breast and side bones of a chicken and the others a sort of greasy soil. [...] A coin was found in the grounds near the old tower, bearing the legend 'FESTINA LENTE' ('Make Haste Slowly'); other details being too worn too make out. No explanation has been put forward for these articles presence here. [...] A portion of the castle survives, about 20 feet long and 25 feet in height, forming the north elevation of the walled garden. It has an elliptical gun port in it and a rectangular window. Some square bee bole recesses are also present.|$|E
2500|$|In all, Lady William Cecil {{uncovered}} thirty-two tombs at {{the site}} which {{became known as the}} [...] "Cecil Tombs", and were later called the Tombs of the Nobles or Qubbet el-Hawa. Her discovery of the tomb of Heqata was described as a small chamber, with two earthenware pots and containing a square coffin upon which were a bow and some arrow tips, as well as three walking sticks. Inside the coffin, on a trellis-shaped frame filled with grids of dirt, lay the mummy of Heqata. The mummy was full of weevils, but was encased in seven layers of finely <b>woven</b> <b>cloth.</b> Though there were no artefacts found with the mummy, the exterior wrapping was painted white about the face with a painted necklace. In many of the tombs, Lady William reported that they appeared to be re-used, and her finds suggest the artefacts came from a diverse range of dynasties. The excavations proved successful and though Carter took [...] "some of the best things", both he and Gaston Maspero were pleased with the endeavour.|$|E
