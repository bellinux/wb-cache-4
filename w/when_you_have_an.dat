25|$|In a {{time when}} defense was defined as “an individual's effort to stop or stymie the {{opposing}} team's counterpart”, Toyota's playing style {{was considered one of}} the most glamorous and worthy to watch. With team defense hardly known back then, Toyota was a typical run-and-gun team that depended heavily on their rebounding prowess. Hence, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> Andrew Fields, Bruce King, John Irving, Abe King, Ramon Fernandez and even a Bobby Jaworski collaring the rebounds, the most common (and very entertaining) spectacle was to see a baseball pass by the rebounder to a streaking player on the break for an easy twinner. Notables among the recipients of the baseball pass over the years in the Toyota lineup included Segura, Cortez, Tuadles, Arnaiz, and Legaspi. In the halfcourt, it was not uncommon to see a similar play that Fernandez and Jaworski employed in the recent Crispa-Toyota reunion game where Fernandez would post up, Jaworski would stay at the top of the arc and wait for Fernandez to be double-teamed. Once the double team is consummated, Jaworski either waits at the 3 point line or makes a straight cut in the middle of the lanes waiting for the blind pass of Fernandez for an easy two. Another common sight was to see Jaworski mapping out the play, cuts in the middle and makes the interior defense commit to him. He then throws a behind-the-back blind pass to cutting slotmen like Fernandez or King for an easy layup or throws it back to good buddy Arnaiz for a long range bomb shot from the arc. Hence, it wasn't a surprise to see Jaworski, Arnaiz and Fernandez (in that order) being the first 3 PBA players to dish off 2,000 assists in their careers.|$|E
500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively lets you know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opening and when to run".|$|E

500|$|USA Today praised Laurie's {{performance}} and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating [...] "a carry-over from last season's brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> actor of Hugh Laurie's range, depth and charisma, putting him center-stage makes perfect sense, particularly when you've written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships {{in a way that}} seems". The New York Daily News noted that [...] "The show pays more attention to relationships we care about, hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden", and noted that [...] "the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a [...] "delightful addition". She concluded, [...] "So different is the premiere that the savvy House (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That {{does not seem to be}} the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough." [...] Conversely, The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan disliked Weston's character, calling him [...] "An unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak". She continued saying [...] "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails". The Sunday Times felt that the show had [...] "lost its sense of humour". The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Clark {{joined a}} panel of about 20 {{prominent}} Arab and one other non-Arab lawyers to defend Saddam Hussein in his trial before the Iraqi Special Tribunal. Clark appeared before the Iraqi Special Tribunal in late November 2005 arguing [...] "that it failed to respect basic human rights and was illegal because it was formed {{as a consequence of}} the United States' illegal war of aggression against the people of Iraq." [...] Clark said that unless the trial was seen as [...] "absolutely fair", it would [...] "divide rather than reconcile Iraq". Christopher Hitchens claimed that Clark was admitting Hussein's guilt when Clark reportedly stated in a 2005 BBC interview: [...] "He [...] had this huge war going on, and you have to act firmly <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> assassination attempt".|$|E
2500|$|Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he {{and others}} {{involved}} with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa. He called the casting a [...] "no-brainer"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered {{for the role of}} Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "That's always a concern <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> actor in your show that is popping—that someone else is going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of what happened in this case," [...] stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 [...] "amazing". He added, [...] "You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise like that, with the numbers." [...] Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows. [...] Rothenberg said he {{would have done the same}} had it been the other way around, with creators asking to borrow one of his actors, and he would have done his best to make the situation work.|$|E

Ismay and I used to wish that it would--we were so tired of hearing about it and its whims. But we did not say so to Aunt Cynthia.

"Quaritch," [...] {{answered}} the Squire, [...] "I have already in your presence told Mr. Cossey {{under what circumstances}} I was favourably inclined to his proposal, so I need not repeat all that. As regards your means, although {{they would have been}} quite insufficient to avert the ruin which threatened us, still you have, I believe, a competence, and owing to your wonderful and most providential discovery the fear of ruin seems to have passed away. It is owing to you that this discovery, which by the way I want to hear all about, has been made; {{had it not been for}} you it never would have been made at all, and therefore I certainly have no right to say anything more about your means. As to your age, well, after all forty-four is not the limit of life, and if Ida does not object to marrying a man of those years, I cannot object to her doing so. With reference to your want of occupation, I think that if you marry Ida this place will, as times are, keep your hands pretty full, especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> obstinate donkey like that fellow George to deal with. I am getting too old and stupid to look after it myself, and besides things are so topsy-turvy that I can't understand them. There is one thing more that I want to say: I forbade you the house. Well, you are a generous- minded man, and it is human to err, so I think that perhaps you will understand my action and not bear me a grudge on that account. Also, I dare say that at the time, and possibly at other times, I said things I should be sorry for if I could remember what they were, which I can't, and if so, I apologise to you as a gentleman ought when he finds himself in the wrong. And so I say God bless you both, and I hope you will be happy in life together; and now come here, Ida, my love, and give me a kiss. You have been a good daughter all your life, and so Quaritch may be sure that you will be a good wife too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I knew another man--let me see--forty {{years ago}} now--who took an old, damp, rotten set of chambers, {{in one of}} the most ancient inns, that had been shut up and empty for years and years before. There were lots of old women's stories about the place, and it {{certainly}} was very far from being a cheerful one; but he was poor, and the rooms were cheap, and that would have been quite a sufficient reason for him, if they had been ten times worse than they really were. He was obliged to take some mouldering fixtures that were on the place, and, among the rest, was a great lumbering wooden press for papers, with large glass doors, and a green curtain inside; a pretty useless thing for him, for he had no papers to put in it; and as to his clothes, he carried them about with him, and that wasn't very hard work, either. Well, he had moved in all his furniture--it wasn't quite a truck-full--and had sprinkled it about the room, so as to make the four chairs look as much like a dozen as possible, and was sitting down before the fire at night, drinking the first glass of two gallons of whisky he had ordered on credit, wondering whether it would ever be paid for, and if so, in how many years' time, when his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press. [...] "Ah," [...] says he, [...] "if I hadn't been obliged to take that ugly article at the old broker's valuation, I might have got something comfortable for the money. I'll tell you what it is, old fellow," [...] he said, speaking aloud to the press, having nothing else to speak to, [...] "if it wouldn't cost more to break up your old carcass, than it would ever be worth afterward, I'd have a fire out of you in less than no time." [...] He had hardly spoken the words, when a sound resembling a faint groan, appeared to issue from the interior of the case. It startled him at first, but thinking, on a moment's reflection, that it must be some young fellow in the next chamber, who had been dining out, he put his feet on the fender, and raised the poker to stir the fire. At that moment, the sound was repeated; and one of the glass doors slowly opening, disclosed a pale and emaciated figure in soiled and worn apparel, standing erect in the press. The figure was tall and thin, and the countenance expressive of care and anxiety; but there was something in the hue of the skin, and gaunt and unearthly appearance of the whole form, which no being of this world was ever seen to wear. [...] "Who are you?" [...] said the new tenant, turning very pale; poising the poker in his hand, however, and taking a very decent aim at the countenance of the figure. [...] "Who are you?" [...] "Don't throw that poker at me," [...] replied the form; [...] "if you hurled it with ever so sure an aim, it would pass through me, without resistance, and expend its force on the wood behind. I am a spirit." [...] "And pray, what do you want here?" [...] faltered the tenant. [...] "In this room," [...] replied the apparition, [...] "my worldly ruin was worked, and I and my children beggared. In this press, the papers in a long, long suit, which accumulated for years, were deposited. In this room, when I had died of grief, and long-deferred hope, two wily harpies divided the wealth for which I had contested during a wretched existence, and of which, at last, not one farthing was left for my unhappy descendants. I terrified them from the spot, and since that day have prowled by night--the only period at which I can revisit the earth--about the scenes of my long-protracted misery. This apartment is mine: leave it to me." [...] "If you insist upon making your appearance here," [...] said the tenant, who had had time to collect his presence of mind during this prosy statement of the ghost's, [...] "I shall give up possession with the greatest pleasure; but I should like to ask you one question, if you will allow me." [...] "Say on," [...] said the apparition sternly. [...] "Well," [...] said the tenant, [...] "I don't apply the observation personally to you, because it is equally applicable to most of the ghosts I ever heard of; but it does appear to me somewhat inconsistent, that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity of visiting the fairest spots of earth--for I suppose space is nothing to you--you should always return exactly to the very places where you have been most miserable." [...] "Egad, that's very true; I never thought of that before," [...] said the ghost. [...] "You see, Sir," [...] pursued the tenant, [...] "this is a very uncomfortable room. From the appearance of that press, I should be disposed to say that it is not wholly free from bugs; and I really think you might find much more comfortable quarters: to say nothing of the climate of London, which is extremely disagreeable." [...] "You are very right, Sir," [...] said the ghost politely, [...] "it never struck me till now; I'll try change of air directly"--and, in fact, he began to vanish as he spoke; his legs, indeed, had quite disappeared. [...] "And if, Sir," [...] said the tenant, calling after him, [...] "if you WOULD have the goodness to suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses, that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere, you will confer a very great benefit on society." [...] "I will," [...] replied the ghost; [...] "we must be dull fellows--very dull fellows, indeed; I can't imagine how we can have been so stupid." [...] With these words, the spirit disappeared; and what is rather remarkable,' added the old man, with a shrewd look round the table, 'he never came back again.' ...|$|E
