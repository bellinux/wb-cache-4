50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1960s {{advances}} in printing and packaging technology led to the introduction of the 'fully laminated' sleeve. Rather than the two-part construction of the 'wrap-around' sleeve, this method consists of a single component part, which is printed in full colour and is completely laminated with the 'flaps' tucked inside the back sleeve section. This is the method generally used for all subsequent releases in the vinyl age and is considered superior {{not only because of the}} additional ease allowed in the use of a single component, but also because the fully <b>laminated</b> <b>finish</b> offers far better protection from discolouration caused by exposure to natural light.|$|R

50|$|The AK-63 F and D (AMM and AMMS) {{are both}} nearly {{identical}} externally to the USSR-manufactured AKM and AKMS. The main {{difference is that}} the AK-63 series retains the distinctive-looking straight pistol grip of the AKM-63. The forward hand grip of the AK-63 also lacks the palm swells which characterize the Soviet AKM (and most AKM copies made in many other countries). The wood on the AK-63, like that of the AKM-63, has a bright, <b>laminated</b> blond <b>finish.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Surftech came to {{the fore}} at a time of {{increased}} focus on new technologies within the surfboard production industry. Whereas traditional boards are made using polyurethane foam [...] "blanks" [...] that are then cut and sanded to form by shapers, Surftech uses a process of blowing polystyrene blanks into preset molds designed by its various shapers. The blanks are then coated with polyvinyl chloride, <b>laminated,</b> and <b>finished.</b> This results in a board that is stronger and considerably lighter than traditional polyurethane boards. Surftech boards are now manufactured in Thailand and shipped throughout the world. As of 2015, Surftech is owned by Triple D, a Thailand-based investment company.|$|R

500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic <b>laminate</b> <b>finish,</b> and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of various aging environments on the painted surface finish of {{unidirectional}} carbon fibre composite laminates, manufactured by autoclave and a novel out-of-autoclave technique was investigated. Laminates were exposed to water immersion, 95 % relative humidity and cyclic environments for 552 h and the surface finish was evaluated using visual and wave-scan distinctness of image (DOI) techniques. It {{was found that the}} <b>laminate</b> surface <b>finish</b> was dependent on the amount of moisture in the aging test. Minor surface waviness occurred on the laminates exposed to the cyclic test, whereas, surface waviness, print through and DOI values were all significantly higher as the laminates absorbed larger quantities of moisture from the hygrothermal and hydrothermal tests. The water immersion test, which was the most detrimental to the surface finish of the painted laminates, produced dense blistering on the autoclave manufactured laminate surface whereas the out-of-autoclave laminate surface produced only a few. It was found that the out-of-autoclave laminate had high substrate surface roughness which resulted in improved paint adhesion and, therefore, prevented the formation of surface blistering with aging...|$|R
25|$|The all-wood wing pairs {{comprised}} {{a single}} structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There {{was a single}} continuous main spar and another continuous rear spar. Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this rear spar {{was one of the}} most complex units to <b>laminate</b> and to <b>finish</b> machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} resin {{infusion}} process parameters on the mechanical properties of stitched or non-stitched composite laminates out of autoclave were studied using {{the design of}} experiment method. This method was chosen due {{to the complexity of}} the problem. The preforms used were laminates of multi-axial quasi-isotropic non-crimp fabric (NCF), either stitched or non-stitched. A literature review identified nine parameters as the key design-of-experiment factors: sewing; the number of NCFs; the number of high-porous media; the interaction between the number of NCFs and the number of high-porous media; the mould temperature, injection temperature and cure temperature; the position of the preform; and, finally, the vacuum level. The mechanical properties studied and the morphological analysis carried out concerned the resistance in tension, compression and shear, the glass transition temperature, the thickness of the <b>finished</b> <b>laminate,</b> and the fibre volume fraction and porosity. The study revealed the best suited manufacturing conditions...|$|R
30|$|A {{total number}} of 80 human {{permanent}} incisors, without caries, obvious defects, or attrition, extracted for periodontal causes {{over a period of}} 6 months, were selected for this study. The teeth were thoroughly cleaned and stored in distilled water and thymol at room temperature. The preparation of the labial surfaces of all the incisors and the direct application of the nanofilled composite (Tetric Evo-ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan) laminate veneers were carried out by the same clinician according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All nanofilled composite <b>laminate</b> veneers were <b>finished</b> using diamond bur and aluminum oxide polishing paste. The 80 teeth were then divided into four groups of 20 teeth; each group was allocated to receive a different laminate surface treatment. In group 1, the laminates were roughened with a diamond bur with grit sizes of 125 to 150 mm (863 Grit; Drendell and Zweilling, Berlin, Germany). In group 2, the laminates were abraded with a microetcher (50 -μm alumina particles; Microetcher ERC, Danville Engineering Inc., Danville, CA, USA). Group 3, the laminates were exposed to 38 % phosphoric acid (3 M ESPE, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) for 60 s, then rinsed with water for 60 s, and dried with compressed oil-free air. Group 4 is the control group which receives no surface treatment. Bracket bonding was carried out after 24 h of laminate placement.|$|R
40|$|On August 7, 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency accidentally {{released}} {{three million}} gallons of acidic mine drainage into Cement Creek near Silverton, Colorado. This catastrophe resulted in a community, state, and world-wide alarm regarding {{the vulnerability of the}} City of Durango’s water supply. A realization that this precious resource can easily be contaminated, leading to human-health concerns and significant environmental impacts rose to the forefront of concern.   This event, among other notable spills, provides motivation to examine the use of autonomous robotic systems, capable of performing real-time, remote monitoring for rapid detection and alarm.   To this end, this project developed a robotic system capable of performing effective and efficient persistent aquatic monitoring.         The Robotic Guidance and Control for the Observation and Monitoring of the Environment (GNOME) Lab at Fort Lewis College, as part of a senior capstone research project, designed and built a networked system of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to continuously monitor the water quality and quantity in the City of Durango's water reservoir; Rogers Reservoir. The robotic system is designed for future applications and deployment in other aquatic resources in the surrounding Four Corners Region as well.   This network consists of three ASVs; that enable accurate spatiotemporal monitoring of a dynamic environment.   The network of ASVs provides information about the physical properties of the water that enable resource managers to assess and respond in near real time to water quality concerns.   The Robotic GNOME Lab is also in collaboration with international educational institutions and local elementary schools. International collaboration is to facilitate data sharing and the development of autonomous sampling and data analysis algorithms. The local collaboration is to teach local elementary students about the physical properties of fluids, water quality, robotics, and the field of aquatic robotics. The networked robotic system consists of three ASVs with custom hull designs optimized for local fresh-water reservoirs and the ability to withstand local weather and potentially low-pH (3 - 4) water. Each vessel optimizes power consumption for both sampling and operation to enable persistent, 24 / 7 autonomous operation.   Typical weather in lakes and reservoirs in a mountainous environment include large temperature swings, wind gusts of 20 mph, various forms of precipitation such as hail and freezing conditions, which have all been considered in the design and construction.   Autonomy is accomplished by on-board Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller and navigation is performed by an Adafruit Breakout V 3 GPS and IMU. Continuous power to the ASVs will be generated onboard with solar panels and battery storage to accomplish 24 / 7 continuous operation. Communication for data transfer and mission updates is handled over 3 G cellular communication through a Particle Electron board. The water quality sensor suite is designed to be modular with interchangeable sensors to target specific sampling requirements for each deployment location. All collected data are posted in near real time to a publicly-available website. The intended uses of the data are to inform local resource managers and policy makers, as well as to engage the public through educational outreach and citizen scientist programs. All three ASVs are designed around a basic dual-hull catamaran design, and are roughly five feet in length, and 2. 5 feet in width. ASV 1 has rectangular hulls, is heavy-duty, and impact resistant. It has a structural foam body with reinforced polyester, and hand-finished laminate. ASV 2 and 3 is cylindrical in shape, lighter, faster, and can carry more payload. These boats are made as a ribbed structure with reinforced epoxy and vacuum bag <b>finished</b> <b>laminate.</b>   This second iteration of design was chosen to reduce the technicality and time of fabrication, the total weight of boat, carry more payload, and to increase stability. For power, two 50 watt solar panels collect solar energy that is stored in two 20 Ah LiFePO 4 batteries. A commercial charger is used to charge both batteries and control the charging cycle. Mechanical relays are located at the grounding terminal of each battery and on the solar panels to disconnect all electrical sources if water enters the hulls or the electronics housing. The batteries are protected from a short circuit by a 15 amp fuse. The electronics for the boats are housed in a pelican case that is suspended between the hulls. An Arduino Mega was chosen to control the ASV and communicates via I 2 C with a Particle Electron that provides 3 G cellular communication. Two Blue Robotics T 200 thrusters are used to propel the boat. A thruster is mounted on the back of each pontoon to provide for differential thrust steering. GPS waypoint navigation is being used with a geo-fence. An IMU is used to provide a magnetic tilt-compensated heading while the boat is traveling at low speeds, and the GPS provides a heading when the boat is traveling at speed greater than 0. 5 meters per second.  Waypoints are chosen based on a sampling algorithm within the geo-fence that provides adequate spatial coverage for optimal water quality monitoring and data collection. The user can change the sampling algorithm while the ASV is deployed through a web-interface on the website. This ability to communicate to the vehicles allows collaboration with international researchers to simultaneously test sampling algorithms with all three vehicles: one vehicle to perform ground truth and the other two vehicles for testing iterations to the sampling strategy. The standard water quality monitoring sensor suite consist of temperature, pH and salinity. These sensors have been included because they provide a fundamental picture of the aquatic environment. Each ASV is set up to accommodate up to three additional sensors, with the possibility of extending this capacity if needed. This network of ASVs will be deployed on Rogers Reservoir to monitor water quality at the Florida River and Animas River inlets, and at the outlet of the Reservoir. Real-time data will be posted on a publically accessible website and a database will be located on the Fort Lewis College server. Additional deployments will occur at regional lakes/reservoirs and in suitably-sized rivers to collect aquatic data of interest to researchers and scientists. The GNOME Lab will continue to develop and test planning and control of the network of ASVs for long-term deployment—requiring efficient data collection techniques, and cost-effective communications. This network of ASVs will eventually be coupled with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to form an aquatic robotic sensing system that can provide a means of understanding complex and dynamic aquatic environments...|$|R
