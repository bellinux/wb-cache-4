Its designers {{stated that the}} tower would be a [...] "monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna." [...] In 2006, Larry Silverstein commented on a planned completion date: [...] "By 2012 <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> completely rebuilt World Trade Center, more magnificent, more spectacular than it ever was." [...] On April 26, 2006, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin. A formal agreement was drafted the following day, the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the Empire State Building. Construction began in May; a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived.|$|E

[...] He told NME: [...] "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nice ... British Socialism." [...] Ono described the lyrical statement of [...] "Imagine" [...] as [...] "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people." [...] Rolling Stone described its lyrics as [...] "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself". Some observers have described the song has having a distinctly anti-religious viewpoint, to the point that some have embraced it as an [...] "atheist anthem".|$|E
500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quine {{resists the}} temptation to say that non-referring terms are {{meaningless}} for reasons made clear above. [...] Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know {{the proper way to}} understand them. [...] However, Czesław Lejewski criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain. [...] Lejewski writes further, ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Even as {{with the}} American {{rejection}} of the League of Nations, our failure {{to live up to}} our obligations to the United Nations is led by a handful of willful senators who choose to pursue their narrow, selfish political objectives at the cost of our nation’s conscience. They pander to and are supported by the Christian Coalition {{and the rest of the}} religious right wing. Their leader, Pat Robertson, has written that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> world government but only when the messiah arrives. Any attempt to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the Devil! Well join me... I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{we could}} accept the {{somewhat}} obscure statement of Eusebius that Hegesippus [...] "made some quotations from the Gospel {{according to the}} Hebrews and from the Syriac Gospel," [...] <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reference to a Syriac New Testament as early as 160–180 AD, the time of that Hebrew Christian writer. One thing is certain, the earliest New Testament of the Syriac church lacked not only the Antilegomena – 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and the Apocalypse – but {{the whole of the}} Catholic Epistles. These were at a later date translated and received into the Syriac Canon of the New Testament, as the quotations of the early Syrian Fathers take no notice of these New Testament writings.|$|E

2500|$|Eclecticism thus {{means the}} {{application}} of the psychological method to the history of philosophy. Confronting the various systems co-ordinated as sensualism, idealism, skepticism, mysticism, with the facts of consciousness, the chasm result was reached [...] " [...] that each system expresses an order of phenomena and ideas, which is in truth very real, but which is not alone in consciousness, and which at the same time holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it follows that each system is not false but incomplete, and that in re-uniting all incomplete systems, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> complete philosophy, adequate to the totality of consciousness." [...] Philosophy, as thus perfected, would not be a mere aggregation of systems, as is ignorantly supposed, but an integration of the truth in each system after the false or incomplete is discarded.|$|E
