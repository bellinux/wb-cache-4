5|$|At {{the end of}} 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, {{and former}} EVP Jack Pogge was {{appointed}} President and Chief Operating Officer in his place. In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives. In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million. The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent. 200 Lucent employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> {{as a result of}} the acquisition. An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> later that year in response to poor economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the acquisition in October 2010, 3G began an immediate restructuring of the company. Seven of the top executives were released, while another 261 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> from the company's headquarters. Chidsey eventually resigned in April 2011, being replaced Alex Behring, one of 3G's managing partners. The position of CEO {{was taken over by}} Bernardo Hees shortly after the acquisition.|$|E
5|$|During the shutdown, some 19,000 state {{employees}} <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> State {{and federal government}} employees in Minnesota lost approximately $65 million in wages {{over the course of}} the shutdown. Because of court rulings, some of the 36,000 {{state employees}} who received layoff notices leading up to the shutdown continued or returned to work during the shutdown. Laid-off employees were immediately eligible for unemployment benefits, and continued to receive health insurance, costing the state millions a week.|$|E

The company started making staffing and pay cuts as executives looked for new funding sources and most of the company's employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> within a few months.|$|E
5|$|NeXT {{withdrew from}} the {{hardware}} business in 1993 and the company was renamed NeXT Software Inc; consequently, 300 of the 540 staff employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> NeXT negotiated to sell the hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon. Canon later {{pulled out of the}} deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. CEO of Sun Microsystems Scott McNealy announced plans to invest $10million in 1993 and use NeXT software (OpenStep) in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create OpenStep which was NeXTSTEP without the Mach-based kernel.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{increasing}} anti-British sentiment {{spread throughout}} the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain. The riots focused on the Jewish community. In 1948, following rising hostilities and looting, most members of Bahrain's Jewish community abandoned their properties and evacuated to Bombay, later settling in Israel (Pardes Hanna-Karkur) and the United Kingdom. , 37 Jews remained in the country. In the 1950s, the National Union Committee, formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, demanded an elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried {{out a number of}} protests and general strikes. In 1965 a month-long uprising broke out after hundreds of workers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|Icos {{is famous}} for tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was {{discovered}} by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly. Boosted by a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phaseIII clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> soon after. CMC Biologics, a Danish contract manufacturer, bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, hedge fund, activist {{investor}} and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper {{reduce its}} cash reserves and cut costs, before Kheradpir was officially appointed. That February, Juniper {{reached an agreement}} with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board. That April, 6% of the company's staff <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> to cut expenses. In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.

5|$|These {{and other}} major changes brought about major defections among ministers and members, which in turn contributed to a further drop in church revenue. In order to bring the {{finances}} in order, {{major changes in the}} church infrastructure were implemented. The World Tomorrow, which had seen record numbers of viewers {{in the early years of}} the Tkach administration, was stopped. The Plain Truth publication runs were reduced. Staff at the church headquarters <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> The famous, church-subsidized Ambassador Auditorium concert series was canceled and offers were sought for the purchase of the Ambassador College Pasadena campus.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Fluor's {{revenues}} fell almost 50 percent, in {{part due}} to the Asian financial crisis and a decrease in overseas business. Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project. Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing. In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called Fluor Signature Services.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 2002, SAS {{announced}} that all handling services operated by Braathens {{would be taken}} over by SAS Ground Services. All SAS employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> Three hundred Braathens' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their seniority. No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The case ended in the courts, where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same seniority as they had in Braathens. On 15 October 2003, Asker and BÃ¦rum District Court decided that only 42 of the employees, those working in Kristiansund and Molde, had right to keep their seniority. The case was appealed, and on 18 March 2005, Borgarting Court of Appeal, with four against three votes, decided in favor of SAS, denying the employees their claim. The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006, when the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of the employees.|$|E

5|$|Starbreeze then {{partnered with}} Electronic Arts for two {{different}} games, one {{was known as}} Project Redlime, while the other was an action-adventure video game set within the Bourne universe. The Bourne game was cancelled {{as a direct result}} of Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass not participating in the fourth Bourne film. Project Redlime had a larger scale than the Bourne game. It was said to be a reinvention of one of Electronic Arts' franchises. The company shifted from a technology-orientated company to focus more on the core gameplay mechanics of their new project. Syndicate was announced in September 2011. The game suffered from a troubled development, with Starbreeze completely reworking the game one year after its initial development. There were also many creative differences between the developer and the publisher, and the two companies suffered from an inharmonious relationship. During the game's development, seven senior members of the company, including HÃ¶gdahl, left to form their own smaller studio. Some of them formed MachineGames to work on their own original games. With a budget that was less than other typical AAA video games, Syndicate received average reviews and was a commercial failure. Grefberg left the company after the game's completion, and 25 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} decreased from 12.3 million passengers in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949, due to passengers switching from SIRT to city-operated buses due to a bus fare cut. On September 5, 1948, 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut; the express service would be reduced during rush hours, and all night trains after 1:29 A. M. would be cancelled. Thirty percent of the company's personnel <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> On September 7, 1948, Staten Island Borough President Cornelius Hall continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers. Previously, they said, the trains pulled out with only one boatload of passengers. On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. On September 22, 1948, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries, Inc of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 {{to early}} 1996, {{although}} Sega's revenue declined {{as part of}} an industry-wide slowdown, the company retained control of 38% of the U.S. video game market (compared to Nintendo's 30% and Sony's 24%). 800,000 PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995, compared to 400,000 Saturn units. In part due to an aggressive price war, the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two-to-one in 1996, while Sega's 16-bit sales declined markedly. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., more than twice the 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and Sega's 32-bit software were sharply reduced, while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three-to-one in the U.S. market in 1997. The 1997 release of Final Fantasy VII significantly increased the PlayStation's popularity in Japan. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47% of the console market, Nintendo controlled 40%, and Sega controlled only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases were proving helpful to the Saturn's success. Reflecting decreased demand for the system, worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2.35 million to 600,000 versus the same period in 1996; shipments in North America declined from 800,000 to 50,000. Due to the Saturn's poor performance in North America, 60 of Sega of America's 200 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> in the fall of 1997.|$|E

5|$|Businessman Clifford Coombs {{took over}} as {{chairman}} in 1965, luring Stan Cullis out of retirement to manage the club. Cullis's team played attractive football which {{took them to the}} semifinals of the League Cup in 1967 and the FA Cup in 1968, but league football needed a different approach. Successor Freddie Goodwin produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semifinal. Two years later, the club raised money by selling Bob Latchford to Everton for a British record fee of Â£350,000, but without his goals the team struggled.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 38â39, 209â15. Sir Alf Ramsey briefly managed the club before Jim Smith took over in 1978. With relegation a certainty, the club sold Trevor Francis to Nottingham Forest, making him the first player transferred for a fee of Â£1million; Francis had scored a total of 133 goals in 329 appearances over his nine years at Birmingham. Smith took Birmingham straight back to the First Division, but a poor start to the 1981â82 season saw him replaced by Ron Saunders, who had just resigned from league champions Aston Villa. Saunders' team struggled to score goals and in 1984 they were relegated. They bounced back up, but the last home game of the 1984â85 promotion season, against Leeds United, was marred by rioting, culminating in the death of a boy when a wall collapsed on him. This was on the same day as the Bradford City stadium fire, and the events at St Andrew's formed part of the remit of Mr Justice Popplewell's inquiry into safety at sports grounds. The club lacked stability {{both on and off the}} field. Saunders quit after FA Cup defeat to non-League team Altrincham, staff <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off,</b> the training ground was sold, and by 1989 Birmingham were in the Third Division for the first time in their history.|$|E
