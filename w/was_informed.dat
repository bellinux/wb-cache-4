40|$|We {{examined}} {{the degree to}} which newly diagnosed patients with advanced lung cancer wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> and involved in medical decision-making, and whether the patients felt their preferences were met. Patients from 13 hospitals in Flanders were interviewed with a standard questionnaire. A total of 128 patients (68 %) participated. Of the patients who wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about life expectancy, half (53 %) reported they <b>were</b> <b>informed,</b> and of those who wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about palliative care and end-of-life decisions, 25 % and 31 % said they <b>were</b> <b>informed,</b> respectively. With regard to participation in medical decision-making (in general, about treatment, transfer or end-of-life), patients who preferred the doctor to make decisions or those who preferred to make the decision themselves often achieved this (in their perception), while patients who wanted an in-between position with some involvement, often did not. To conclude, preferences of patients with lung cancer for information concerning delicate topics and for shared decision-making with the physician were not well met...|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he <b>was</b> <b>informed</b> that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he <b>was</b> <b>informed</b> that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that a physician only {{needs to do}} what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care).
