5|$|At {{the battle}} itself, Johnson's forces <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> attack. One {{battalion}} of five hundred men, under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. There {{was too much}} tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; {{three quarters of the}} regulars were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the draft}} class members agreed to {{four-year}} deals with the Bears. Langford, Amos and Fabuluje <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> sign, doing so on May 5. The following day, White and Goldman were signed. Grasu was the last player to sign a contract, agreeing to a deal on May 8.|$|E
25|$|Gerhard Herzberg <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{actually}} observe <b>the</b> {{spectrum of}} neutral H3, and this triatomic molecule <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> have a Rydberg spectrum measured where its own ground state was unstable.|$|R
50|$|Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali (أبو الأسود الدؤلي) (ca. 603CE/16BH - 688 or 689CE/69AH) {{was a close}} {{companion}} of Ali ibn Abi Talib and an arab grammarian.

50|$|Hugh Falconer MD FRS (29 February 1808 - 31 January 1865) was a Scottish geologist, botanist, palaeontologist, and paleoanthropologist. He {{studied the}} flora, fauna, and geology of India, Assam, and Burma, and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> suggest <b>the</b> modern {{evolutionary}} theory of punctuated equilibrium.

5|$|Hafnium was {{separated}} from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|In 1868–1869, German geologists Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons Stübel <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{attempt to}} climb Ruiz. In 1936, W. Cunet and Augusto Gansser-Biaggi {{made the first}} {{successful}} ascent, partly by ski; they repeated the ascent in 1939.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of Ghent <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein.

An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.|$|E

5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, {{registration}} F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft requested, respectively. The first of Lufthansa's V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecular}} {{evidence suggests}} that the storm petrels <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. Many taxonomists used to retain the diving petrels in this family also, but today their distinctiveness is considered well supported.|$|E
50|$|Askanazy made {{contributions}} {{in the fields of}} hematology and parasitology, also conducting important research of bone pathology and the formation of tumors in humans. In 1898 he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> scientist <b>to</b> describe Hürthle cells, and in 1904 he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> link osteitis fibrosa cystica with parathyroid tumors. In 1921, he provided an early description of Schaumann bodies (kalkdrusen), and two years later, he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> describe a gastric carcinoid tumor.|$|R
500|$|Henri Poincaré in 1907 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} a transducer {{as a pair}} of linear algebraic equations relating electrical variables (voltage and current) to mechanical variables (force and velocity).

Robie House, a Frank Lloyd Wright building acquired by the university in 1963, is also a National Historic Landmark, as is room 405 of the George Herbert Jones Laboratory, where Glenn T. Seaborg and his team <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> isolate plutonium. Hitchcock Hall, an undergraduate dormitory, is on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|These three Native American leaders <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be tried, for raids (Warren Wagon Train Raid) and murder, in a United States {{civil court}} {{instead of a}} {{military}} court. This would deny them any vestige of rights as prisoners of war by being tried as any common criminal in the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas in Jacksboro, Texas near Fort Richardson.|$|E
5|$|Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch {{analyzed}} {{networks of}} idealized artificial neurons and showed {{how they might}} perform simple logical functions. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> describe what later researchers would call a neural network. One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was a young Marvin Minsky, then a 24-year-old graduate student. In 1951 (with Dean Edmonds) he built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> branch off.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Hawaiians <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered {{state of the}} volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked {{the founding of the}} Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic {{were the first}} physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

50|$|Danilewsky <b>was</b> one of <b>the</b> {{pioneers of}} neurobiology. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} <b>the</b> nerve impulse {{system in the}} brain of dogs.

In 1884 he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> observe <b>the</b> species of Haemoproteus, parasitic protozoan {{in the blood of}} birds, and established the order Haemospororida for it. He helped to establish a new genus Leucocytozoon (but did not give <b>the</b> name). He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> observe <b>the</b> genus in 1889. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> species described in 1898 was even named primarily after him as Leukocytozoen Danilewskyi.|$|R
