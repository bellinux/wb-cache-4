5000|$|ECB {{officials}} {{agreed on}} Thursday 22 May 2014 that Franco-Belgian bank Dexia {{would not have}} to demonstrate it could bear a financial crisis in a Europe-wide stress test, reducing the chances of it needing further state aid. The ECB had already acknowledged Dexia's [...] "specific situation", with an assessment of its finances carried out over its 2011 <b>wind-down</b> <b>plan.</b> That EU-approved plans makes Dexia unique among the 128 major euro zone banks being reviewed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the 124 EU banks that are being subjected to stress tests by the European Banking Authority (EBA). Single Supervisory Mechanism's Comprehensive Assessment in October 2014 shown Dexia had a capital shortfall of â‚¬340 million. However, as the bank was guarantee by States, the bank was not required to capital increases.|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis presents an opportunity [...] {{for the first}} time in many years [...] for wholesale reform of the international financial and monetary system. The root causes of the crisis, says Goldstein, can be found in both the financial and monetary spheres and so reforms must be prescribed for both. On the financial side, he emphasizes two problems: pricking asset price bubbles before they get too large and confronting "too big to fail" financial institutions. On the monetary side, he concentrates on what can be done to induce large, surplus economies to abandon now [...] and avoid in the future [...] beggar-thy-neighbor exchange rate policies. Central banks and regulatory authorities need to try much harder to identify bubbles before they get too large and consider a better bubble-busting tool kit, which would include some combination of instruments such as regulatory capital and regulatory liquidity requirements, margin requirements, loan-to-value ratios on residential and commercial mortgages, and lending standards. To confront "too-big-to fail," if higher capital requirements for larger financial institutions are not enough, Goldstein prescribes taking together four policy measures: requiring all systemically important institutions to have <b>wind-down</b> <b>plans</b> that would prevent unacceptable spillovers; ensuring that special resolution authority exists for all systemically important financial institutions; designing resolution authority in a way that supports market discipline; and imposing explicit size limits on systemically important financial institutions relative to GDP. Goldstein then draws attention to China's highly significant case of beggar-thy-neighbor exchange rate policy and the International Monetary Fund's abysmal surveillance of the problem. He recommends that the Fund become far tougher on errant countries than it is now. The Fund's engagement with members who have emerging exchange rate problems should be made less subject to politicization and long delays. There needs to be a workable framework for the Fund's exchange rate surveillance that is capable of sending the message that the Fund views the country's exchange rate policy not only as ill-advised but also as being inconsistent with the country's obligations as a member of the Fund and, hence, that the policy has to be changed. Finally, there needs to be a workable, graduated set of penalties for countries that refuse persistently to honor their international obligations on exchange rate policy. ...|$|R
40|$|The post-financial crisis era {{has seen}} a {{paradigm}} shift in the regulation of the financial services industry. Systemically important financial institutions are becoming subject to new regulatory requirements in multiple areas including increased capital and liquidity requirements, mandatory stress tests, restrictions on their activities, higher prudential standards and recapitalization or <b>wind-down</b> mechanisms. Enhanced <b>planning</b> for the risk of failure is {{an important element of}} the new regulatory paradigm. Supervisors from the United States, the European Union and the Group of Twenty (G 20) are developing requirements for systemically important financial institutions to create credible living wills. These plans will include key information about the firm and set forth actions that could be taken to reduce idiosyncratic losses and to mitigate systemic contagion in the event of financial distress, up to and including the insolvency or failure of the firm. In some ways, living wills are analogous to contingency planning for public emergencies that arise when a hurricane, earthquake or other natural disaster strikes. Even though human choices are the underlying causes of financial panics, financial panics are also like natural disasters because they have occurred repeatedly, suddenly, unpredictabl...|$|R
