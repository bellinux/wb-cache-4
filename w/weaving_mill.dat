Noble also opened a trading company called N. Noble & Company. The company purchased produce from area farmers and shipped it to New Orleans to be sold. In 1819 a boating accident destroyed one of his shipments and {{left him with a}} large debt that took several years to repay. Later that year he married his cousin, Catherin Stull van Swearingen.

The opening scenes were filmed at Elland Road, Leeds, and Odsal Stadium, Bradford, both locations standing in for the old Wembley Stadium. For indoor scenes, Lancaster House substituted for Buckingham Palace, and Ely Cathedral stood in for Westminster Abbey, while the <b>weaving</b> <b>mill</b> scene was filmed at the Queen Street Mill in [...] Burnley. The cinematography {{differs from that of}} other historical dramas: hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider than normal lenses were employed to recreate the Duke of York's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters: in his first consultation with Logue, the Duke is captured hunched {{on the side of a}} couch at the edge of the frame.|$|E

2500|$|The Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1152–1190) {{created a}} Reichsvogtei (roughly [...] "Imperial Bailiwick"), and in 1180 put Wetzlar's {{citizens}} {{on the same}} level as Frankfurt's. Wetzlar became a Free Imperial City and kept this distinction until 1803. For the town's protection, and to secure the Wetterau as an Imperial Province, he expanded high above Wetzlar the Imperial Castle (Reichsburg), which had most likely already stood {{in one form or another}} before then. The origin of the name [...] "Reichsburg Kalsmunt" [...] is not quite clear. The following explanation cannot be ruled out: Kals- = Karls and munt ≈ vassal, that is, a liege of the Frankish court. Thus it would seem to be a case of a building work from Charlemagne's time ("Charlemagne" [...] is [...] "Karl der Große" [...] – [...] "Charles the Great" [...] (740s–814) – in German). Imperial coinage was struck at Kalsmunt. The commercial road, which crossed the Lahn at Wetzlar, the town's iron production, to which the Iron Market (forum ferri) still bears witness, the wool <b>weaving</b> <b>mill</b> and tanning seemed a good basis on which to develop the town further.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, {{prior to}} the US entry into World War I, the U.S. War Department negoiated with Swiss {{inventor}} and businessman Camille Dreyfus to establish an acetate lacquer (commonly called [...] "acetate dope") production facility in Cumberland. At that time, acetate dope was needed by the aircraft industry to coat and stretch the fabric on aircraft fuselages. [...] The American Cellulose & Chemical Manufacturing Company began construction of the Cumberland facility in 1918, but {{the war was over}} before the plant could be completed. [...] As a result, production at the Cumberland factory was shifted from producing acetate dope for the military to production of cellulose acetate yarn for the textile industry. The first acetate yarn spun in America was on Christmas Day, 1924, at the Cumberland plant. The company introduced the word [...] "Celanese," [...] a portmanteau of [...] "cellulose" [...] and [...] "ease," [...] as a trade name in 1925, and the company itself took this name in 1927. Celanese acetate was introduced as [...] "Artificial Silk." [...] In 1926, a <b>weaving</b> <b>mill</b> was established in the Cumberland plant to develop acetate-containing fabrics on a commercial scale. This mill included equipment that could dye and weave the new fibers successfully. In 1974, Celanese established a Cytrel Tobacco Supplement plant in Cumberland with a peak capacity of 20 million lbs a year. The company closed its Cumberland plant in 1983.|$|E
