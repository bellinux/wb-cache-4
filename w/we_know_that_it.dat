5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the manuscript}} before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in van Vliet's collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library {{it came to the}} Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} located and {{excavated}} at Hasholme, {{on the north}} bank of the River Foulness in the broad river channel. The boat was situated in mostly waterlogged clay (silty-clay, silt, and sand) deposits, which greatly helped {{the preservation of the}} timbers. Apart from the boat itself, the excavations did not produce any major associated artifacts, {{with the exception of a}} single pottery shard. For dating purposes two techniques, tree-ring dating and radiocarbon 14C/thermoluminescence, were employed. Both methods gave rather comparable results of some time between 750 and 390 BC, which approximately correlates with the later European Iron Age. Based on reconstruction of the landscape around the site, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was dominated by mixed oak, birch, and alder woodland, with some meadows and marshes, as well as many river tributaries and oxbow lakes.|$|E
25|$|Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium. With Mark Antony's defeat, no one remained to oppose Octavian. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. He declared a general amnesty for the former supporters of his enemies, and provided land for over 120,000 former soldiers. As soon as these reforms had been implemented, the price of land began to rise and trade was revived. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up. In 29 BC, another alteration was made to his legal status, of which we know very little. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> involved the granting to Octavian of Consular imperium (command authority), and thus control over the army and the provinces. This alteration probably also gave him the authority to take a census.|$|E

500|$|Garnet {{was not at}} {{all like}} Catesby, {{described}} by Fraser as possessing the mentality [...] "of the crusader who does not hesitate to employ the sword in the cause of values which he considers are spiritual". In contrast, Garnet believed that [...] "things were best settled by submission to the will of God." [...] He was ebullient over King James's succession to the English throne, and hoped there would be no foreign interference. Of the 1603 Bye Plot, revealed (with his blessing) to the Privy Council by two Catholic priests, he wrote that it was [...] "a piece of impudent folly, for <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is by peaceful means that his Holiness and other princes are prepared to help us." [...] He exhorted that Pope Clement VIII instruct all English Catholics not to engage in violent rebellion, [...] "quiete et pacifice". [...] It was a message echoed by Archpriest George Blackwell, who commanded his priests never to attempt any such thing, but it proved controversial; early in summer 1605 Garnet reported to Rome that English Catholics had reached [...] "a stage of desperation".|$|E

[...] EPA revised the report to satisfy those concerns and published a response to each of the comments. [...] While not taking issue with the report's findings, the Government Accountability Project complained that EPA delayed releasing the report three months so that its results could be excluded from a regulatory finding about whether greenhouse gases threaten public health.|$|E

2500|$|Recall {{that the}} moral law, if it exists, must apply universally and necessarily. Therefore, a moral law could never rest on {{hypothetical}} imperatives, which only apply if one adopts some particular end. Rather, the imperative associated with the moral law must be a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative holds for all rational agents, regardless of whatever varying ends a person may have. If we could find it, the categorical imperative would provide us with the moral law. What would the categorical imperative look like? <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could never {{be based on the}} particular ends that people adopt to give themselves rules of action. Kant thinks that this leaves us with one remaining alternative, namely that the categorical imperative must be based on the notion of a law itself. Laws (or commands), by definition, apply universally. [...] From this observation, Kant derives the categorical imperative, which requires that moral agents act only {{in a way that the}} principle of their will could become a universal law. (4:421) The categorical imperative is a test of proposed maxims; it does not generate a list of duties on its own. [...] The categorical imperative is Kant’s general statement of the supreme principle of morality, but Kant goes on to provide three different formulations of this general statement.|$|E
2500|$|Roy Graham, an Adventist scholar has {{explained}} {{his interpretation of}} what Ellen White's statement on being a lesser light means. He writes [...] "The moon is called in Scripture the 'lesser light'. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> shines with 'borrowed light' from the sun. But this {{does not make the}} moon any less 'authoritative.' It has its sphere and its appointed task in God's creation. So when Ellen White uses this term to describe her work, she is not just being modest or humble; she is not saying that she is a second-class prophet; she is not saying that her messages are of a less important or less urgent nature than those of the Biblical prophets. Rather, she is emphasizing the function of her role and her messages. The work of any one prophet cannot be compared to the cumulative light that shines across the centuries from the many prophets whose works are found in the Holy Scriptures. But the source of her ministry is the same as theirs, and while her work was primarily for the Seventh-day Adventist church, this in no wise diminishes the importance of her role to that people[...] [...] [...] She is one and the canonical prophets are many. But both she and they were commissioned by the Holy Spirit to accomplish specific tasks for God's people. It is important to discern the distinctive function of both." ...|$|E
