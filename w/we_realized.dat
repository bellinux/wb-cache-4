500|$|We {{have been}} working {{together}} as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After {{a lot of discussion}} and some deep soul searching, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that {{now is the time to}} pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. —Destiny's Child, MTV ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} scene of the episode, when Jon Snow arises from the table, Weiss stated that [...] "Jon coming back to life was {{something}} in the first, first version we wrote originally had more talking. And as we saw it on the page written out, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> it was just too much dialogue, we decided to just give the kind of awe of that moment its due." ...|$|E
500|$|More changes {{occurred}} to the series' storylines during the casting process. The writers {{found that they}} had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became [...] "this whole new being", and that [...] "it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> how much fun Monica's neuroses are." ...|$|E

In particular, when we require that answers to the above questions be not only written down as paperware but be evaluated in wireless mesh testbeds, <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> that <b>we</b> are worlds away even from understanding the behavior of wireless mesh networks—let alone being able to run them efficiently.|$|R
500|$|In {{regards to}} the various stories {{throughout}} the episode, {{and the amount of}} time passing in each one of them, Cogman stated, [...] "The timelines between the various storylines don’t necessarily line up within a given episode. For instance, the “Northern Tour” Jon and Sansa embark on would probably take a couple weeks, but Arya’s storyline over the past few episodes only spans a few days. <b>We</b> <b>realized</b> a while ago that if we tied ourselves in knots trying to make all the “story days” line up between all the characters the momentum would suffer." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham, {{a former}} {{resident}} of New York, had conceived {{the idea of}} having the family travel to the city to locate their missing car and believed it to be [...] "a classic Manhattan problem". Bill Oakley, who had visited the World Trade Center when the construction of the towers was completed in 1973, suggested parking the car in the plaza of the buildings. Josh Weinstein observed that, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that there was a plaza between the two towers, we knew it was a perfect spot to have Homer's car." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first cut}} of the film was two-and-a-half hours long. Parker then cut the film down to two hours when he {{realized}} {{there was a way}} to further trim the film. [...] "There were a number of scenes that paced well when we intercut them rather than letting them play as written in a linear fashion. For instance, we wanted to let the mission briefing scene play normally—this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target. That scene was followed by a scene of the target beheading a local. <b>We</b> <b>realized</b> that an actual briefing is very technical and rote, so intercutting these scenes helped keep the audience engaged." ...|$|E

But why complain, when it is the fate of all humanity? To be true to our Creator, who directs all things, we must bow to His will without protest. You will love your father, Lory, because he will love you; and he is a good man, and kindly, so I believe he will make your life as happy as I could have done." ...|$|R

500|$|Several film {{executives}} later made efforts {{towards the}} project, including Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, Dick Zondag, Glen Keane, and Dave Goetz. In 2011, director Chris Buck {{began work on}} another attempted adaption and also faced challenges with the Snow Queen character. Producer Peter Del Vecho explained that this was primarily because she was not relatable and too isolated, having no personal connections. As a result, they could not explain her motivations. After several changes were proposed, someone on the writing team suggested making the Snow Queen Anna's sister. [...] "Once <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that these characters could be siblings and have a relationship, everything changed," [...] Del Vecho relayed.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> we were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} DecembeRadio all began playing music in their teens. [...] Josh Reedy and Brian Bunn {{attended}} the same schools, and the former's rendition of [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] on guitar at {{a middle school}} talent show convinced Bunn to take up guitar, as well. [...] "Our first year of high school, we started a Top 40 band. We played Hootie & the Blowfish covers {{and that sort of}} thing. Then shortly thereafter, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that God had given us these gifts, and we wanted to utilize them for him," [...] recalled Bunn. [...] The pair decided to pursue music full-time upon graduation from Auburn High School in Riner, Virginia.|$|E

500|$|MGM's {{special edition}} of the 1981 film was not {{released}} until 2003 because the original negative had disappeared. [...] The workprint containing deleted scenes finally {{turned up in the}} Hutchinson, Kansas salt mine film depository. [...] The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: [...] "After we screened the rough cut, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there." [...] The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.|$|E
500|$|Garbage {{later said}} that the album was {{released}} as a contractual obligation to Warner Music: [...] "This was the final straw that broke our backs", recalled Manson five years later. [...] "The record company we had been sold to in the U.K. demanded that we release a [...] "greatest hits" [...] {{in order to meet}} their quarterly requirements. We were {{not in a position to}} stop it. As a result, they shoved this collection out with no promotion whatsoever. It was right there and then that <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> how crazy and out of whack things had gotten." [...] Garbage remained on hiatus for a further three years until regrouping to record their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind of People, released in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Marvel held a {{press event}} to {{announce}} the titles of their Phase Three films. The event, which drew comparisons to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, was done because all the information was ready.

So the plan has been, since a few weeks before Comic-Con when <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> we weren't {{going to be able to}} do everything we wanted to do, is to decide 'let's do either something we haven't done in a long time, or something we've never done.' Which is a singular event, just to announce what we have when it's ready. I thought that might be early August, or mid-September, it ended up being [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|When The Band {{began work}} on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they {{employed}} a recording technique {{similar to the one}} they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, [...] "We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique." [...] That technique influenced groups including The Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record [...] "in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that The Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes".|$|E
500|$|Daft Punk {{produced}} the tracks included in Homework without {{a plan to}} release an album. Bangalter stated, [...] "It {{was supposed to be}} just a load of singles. But we did so many tracks over a period of five months that <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that we had a good album." [...] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP. De Homem-Christo remarked, [...] "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album." [...] The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to [...] "the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Song's first {{starring}} {{role as the}} title character was in the 2006 Disney Channel Original Movie , which had over 5.7 million viewers at its premiere. Wendy Wu was planned to be a comedy, but {{the directors of the}} film were having trouble finding a suitable actor with both the comedic presence and taekwondo ability to play the main character, originally named Kenny Lu. Lydia Cook, one of the films's directors, said, [...] "Brenda was originally brought in to play the [...] monk's role. We started training with her in martial arts, and that's when <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that she should be Kenny Lu. They quickly switched things around and offered Brenda the lead in the movie. She had the perfect combination of wit and martial arts." [...] Song had to break a brick with her hand in a screen test before landing the title role.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Kirk Hammett {{noted that}} {{the length of the}} songs was {{problematic}} for fans and for the band: [...] "Touring behind it, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long. One day after we played 'Justice' and got off the stage one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again. Nevertheless, [...] "One" [...] quickly became [...] a permanent fixture in the band's setlist. When performed live, the opening war sound is lengthened from seventeen seconds to approximately two minutes. At the song's conclusion, the stage turns pitch-black and fire erupts from various places. The live performance is characterized as a [...] "musical and visual highlight" [...] by Rolling Stone journalist Denise Sheppard. Other songs from …And Justice for All that have frequently been performed are [...] "Blackened" [...] and [...] "Harvester of Sorrow", which were often featured during the album's promotional Damaged Justice Tour.|$|E
500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO. The group had also planned to tour in Israel and Australia following their European tour, but refused to do so, as they had been away from home for three weeks and found the tour [...] "rigorous". Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of our music. When we discovered that, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> that the music we were working with really was universal, that we didn't have to think of a particular market.
