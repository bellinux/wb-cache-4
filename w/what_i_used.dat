5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

500|$|... "A Change in Me" [...] was {{originally}} published in the key of D major, performed at a slow tempo. A [...] "belty" [...] pop ballad often performed within [...] "a plaintive register", its lead vocal spans two octaves, from A3 to F5. Like most of the musical's songs, the melody of [...] "A Change in Me" [...] is borrowed from the film's orchestral score. The New Jersey Montly summarized [...] "A Change in Me" [...] as [...] "a soaring number about how adventure comes in many forms." [...] Beginning, [...] "There's been a change in me a kind of moving on though <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to be", the song was identified by author Thomas S. Hischak as a delicate, [...] "moving ballad". Lyrically, the song is [...] "about being at peace with oneself and how it’s expected as you grow up." [...] It has also been described as [...] "uplifting", featuring the lyrics [...] "I never thought I’d leave behind / My childhood dreams / But I don’t mind / I’m where and who I want to be". The chorus ends [...] "Now I love the world I see / No change of heart–a change in me".|$|E
2500|$|Dean starred for the Cardinals {{as one of}} baseball's premier {{pitchers}} from 1932 to 1937, {{with four}} All-Star Games, leading the NL in wins and shutouts twice, strikeouts four times, complete games and innings pitched three times, while procuring an MVP award with two runner-up finishes. [...] He also carried a distinctive persona when off the mound. [...] Dean was a robust, zany, quasi-Yogi Berra-prototype who uttered such memorable quotes as, [...] "It ain't bragging {{if you can do}} it", [...] "Son, what kind of pitch would you like to miss?", [...] "He slud into third", [...] "I ain't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to be, but who the hell is?", [...] "The doctors x-rayed my head and found nothing", [...] "The good Lord was good to me. [...] He gave me a strong body, a good right arm, and a weak mind", and [...] "It puzzles me how they know what corners are good for filling stations. [...] Just how did they know gas and oil was under there?" [...] His uninhibited nature and willingness to become a lightning rod for criticism garnered massive popularity with teammates, fans and media alike. [...] After retiring as a player, Dean augmented even more popularity as a sportscaster and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|... "My lack {{of fear of}} this barbaric {{methodology}} of death, I rely upon my faith. It {{has nothing to do}} with machismo, with manhood, or with some pseudo former gang street code. This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E

5000|$|Notes {{actually}} do mean something. They have power. I think of notes as being expensive. You don't just throw them around.

[...] I won the argument and I still think it's sort of brave, because the end of [...] "With or Without You" [...] could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to it which I think is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do and <b>what</b> a lot of guitar heroes do. —The Edge (1991) ...|$|R
