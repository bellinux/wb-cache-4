5|$|As Ambo (Neoguri) passed {{directly}} through many parts Visayas and Mindanao, PAGASA issued Public Storm <b>Warning</b> <b>Signals</b> for these areas. Signal number one was issued for southern Negros, Siquijor and Camiguin. This storm signal was later scaled back {{up until the}} storm reached Palawan and the South China Sea.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry where a {{harmless}} species has evolved to imitate the <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> of a harmful species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{need not}} involve visual mimicry, but can employ {{deception}} {{of any of}} the senses. While visual signals have attracted most study, some moths mimic the ultrasound <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> sent by unpalatable moths to bat predators, constituting auditory Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an {{organism}} (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This {{results in the}} mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or <b>warning</b> <b>signals,</b> to avoid being attacked by a predator.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. <b>Warning</b> <b>signals</b> are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
5|$|The 1988Bangladesh cyclone struck as Bangladesh was {{recovering}} from what had been considered the worst flood in Bangladeshi history earlier in the year. As a result, the additional effects of the passing cyclone exacerbated the flood's impacts. Beginning two days before landfall, Bangladesh state radio and television continuously broadcast <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> urging the evacuation of endangered residents along coastal areas.|$|E
30|$|Here {{again we}} address a {{temporal}} issue. A <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> {{should be given}} neither too late nor too early. In the former case, {{there would not be}} time enough to react to the signalized threat. In the latter case, the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> could spread unnecessary panic, or change danger circumstances so that, eventually, signalling itself proves inefficient [39, 43, 44].|$|R

5|$|The Nigerian {{government}} has commissioned the overseas production and launch of four satellites. The Nigeriasat-1 {{was the first}} satellite to be built under the Nigerian government sponsorship. The satellite was launched from Russia on 27 September 2003. Nigeriasat-1 {{was part of the}} worldwide Disaster Monitoring Constellation System. The primary objectives of the Nigeriasat-1 were: to give early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> of environmental disaster; to help detect and control desertification {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria; to assist in demographic planning; to establish the relationship between malaria vectors and the environment that breeds malaria and to give early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> on future outbreaks of meningitis using remote sensing technology; to provide the technology needed to bring education to all parts of the country through distant learning; and to aid in conflict resolution and border disputes by mapping out state and International borders.|$|E
5|$|Within the Philippines, PAGASA issued {{no public}} storm <b>warning</b> <b>signals,</b> {{as the storm}} {{was too far away}} from the country to prompt the {{issuance}} of such advisories. However, they did warn that the cyclone was expected to enhance the southwest monsoon and bring rain over Central and Southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{impacting}} the Philippines, Public Storm <b>Warning</b> <b>Signals</b> #3 and #4, the two highest levels, {{were raised}} for several provinces in Luzon. Thousands of residents were urged to evacuate while local authorities prepared services for quick recovery efforts. With Cimaron initially expected to strike Vietnam, officials planned to evacuate 218,000people; however, Cimaron's slow motion and demise over open waters resulted in these plans being suspended. Officials in Thailand and southern China also advised residents of possible {{effects from the}} storm.|$|E
40|$|Ten {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease performed a simple reaction time task in which, on hearing a tone, they pressed a button {{with the left}} thumb. In the first experiment tones sometimes occurred unannounced {{and at other times}} were preceded (by between 0 and 3200 ms) by a <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> The second experiment was identical to the first except that the subject had simultaneously to perform a simple continuous task with his right hand. Patients had slower reaction times than controls under all circumstances. In general, however, the effect of a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> and the effect of a second task were the same for both groups. In the control group the effect of a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> depended on whether or not a second task was being performed. Specifically, the advantage of a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> for reaction time was lost after long intervals (greater than 200 ms) when a second task was being performed. Parkinson's disease patients lost this advantage even when they were not performing a second task. Animal studies have suggested that dopamine deficiency results in an increase in neural "noise" in the basal ganglia. The behavioural consequences of this may be that Parkinson's disease patients always perform as if they were carrying out another task at the same time. In contrast, their ability to benefit from a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> and to allocate attentional resources are unimpaired...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> preceding shocks greatly increased the effectiveness of avoidance responding. Periods of “warm-up” {{at the beginning of}} the session were eliminated, and the number of shocks received by the subjects was greatly reduced. With response-shock interval constant, response rate increased as the interval between the response and the onset of the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> was shortened. The response tended to occur shortly after the onset of the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> regardless of the duration of these “safe” periods. A greatly elevated response rate was maintained even when the duration of the safe period was reduced to 0. 3 sec. Thus, the pre-shock signal obtained nearly exclusive control of the responding and overrode the usual “temporal discrimination” of the response-shock interval...|$|R
50|$|In some cases, the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> may {{be played}} by a mobile system {{installed}} on the fire department's vehicles.|$|R
5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. <b>Warning</b> <b>signals</b> are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warning</b> <b>signals</b> do not {{necessarily}} require that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated {{with the level of}} toxicity of the organism.|$|E

40|$|Eight pigeons were {{initially}} trained to peck a white key for food under a variable-interval 1 -min schedule of reinforcement. Then, a shock-avoidance schedule was initiated and food {{was no longer}} available in the experimental situation. Under the avoidance schedule, each peck on the key postponed shock for 40 sec. A <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> consisting of tone and red houselights, was presented after 30 sec without a response. If no response occurred, a shock was delivered 10 sec after warning-signal onset. Shocks were delivered every 10 sec {{in the presence of}} the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> until a response was made. The <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> was terminated only by a response. Key pecking of all eight pigeons came under control of the avoidance schedule and responding continued throughout the 20 -day avoidance training period...|$|R
5|$|Within the Western Pacific, RSMC Tokyo-Typhoon Center, {{part of the}} Japan Meteorological Agency has had the {{official}} warning responsibility {{for the whole of}} the Western Pacific since 1989, and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000. However each National Meteorological and Hydrological Service within the western Pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country, such as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center for United States agencies, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for interests in the island archipelago nation, and the Hong Kong Observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Krovanh was {{approaching}} the Philippines, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau cautioned {{the residents of}} the island against strong winds and warning ships in the Bashi Channel. After the typhoon entered the South China Sea, sea warnings were issued for areas offshore Hainan. Additional warnings were issued and expanded as Krovanh moved closer to the Chinese coast. In preparation for the storm, shipping routes across the Qiongzhou Strait were suspended, while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both Hainan and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No.1 on August23, which was upgraded to a Strong Wind Signal No.3 at around noon the following day. All <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in Hong Kong were discontinued on August25. In Guangzhou, 15flights were cancelled in anticipation of Krovanh, stranding 500passengers.|$|E
5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
40|$|Four rats {{were trained}} to lever press under a {{discriminated}} avoidance/escape schedule in which separately <b>signalled</b> safe and <b>warning</b> periods were 100 sec and 32 sec respectively. The auditory and not the visual component of the compound <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> became associated with the discriminative control of lever pressing. Avoidance behavior also came under temporal control, in that the probability of lever pressing increased as the warning period progressed. Timing began {{with the onset of}} the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> rather than the offset of the safe signal. However, after the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> had been progressively eliminated, timing began with the offset of the safe signal. When neither signal was normally available, the temporal distribution of avoidance behavior changed markedly. Drifts in the temporal distribution of lever pressing occurred throughout the study; these were manipulated for two animals...|$|R

5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{named for}} the German naturalist Fritz Müller, {{describes}} a situation where two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first, Bates could not explain why this should be so—if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses two species, individuals in both those species {{are more likely to}} survive. This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it avoids potentially harmful encounters. The usually clear distinction between mimic and model is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species can be said to be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it is more realistic to speak of each as a co-mimic than of distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> tend to converge. Also, the two species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Noul, {{known as}} Typhoon Dodong within the country, entered the Philippine area of Responsibility on May7. In {{response}} to the storm, PAGASA raised warning signal 4, the highest level, for northeastern Cagayan {{as well as the}} offshore Batanes and Babuyan Islands. Neighboring provinces had lower <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> A total of 3,803people evacuated their homes in Cagayan and Isabela to 27storm shelters; families returned home by late on May10 after the storm moved ashore without causing much damage. Flights and ferry routes were canceled, stranding 10,000people. The Philippine Army deployed 18soldiers to assist in storm preparations, utilizing boats and helicopters. Fishermen were advised not to go out to sea east of Luzon. People were also evacuated from the vicinity of Mount Bulusan after rains from Noul threatened to cause lahars and mudslides from ash of a recent eruption. They were allowed to return after Noul recurved to the north and the threat did not materialize. Two people in Cagayan died due to electrocution while attempting to fix their roofs ahead of the storm.|$|E

40|$|Quiet {{vehicles}} may {{be noticed}} relatively late and therefore constitute a potential risk for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists. The ideal acoustic <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> generator notifies vulnerable road users while minimizing noise pollution. Several sensor systems exist which {{are able to}} reveal {{the position of the}} vulnerable road users, which information can be used by the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> generator. The <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> generator is designed to generate the specified <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> at the location of the vulnerable road user while the acoustic response at other locations is minimized. The directional sound beam was realized with an array of controlled actuators, using least-squares beamforming methods. The particular least-squares methods are based on measured transfer functions between the actuators and the acoustic sensors. Different actuator technologies were evaluated. Changes of the relative positions of the vehicle and the vulnerable road user require continuous adjustments of the sound beam. The latency of the beamforming method with respect to an adjusted beaming direction is an important factor for the present application. Different methods to generate the sound beam are described and advantages of the different beamforming methods in experimental results are shown. Rapid real-time adjustment of the beaming direction is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|After {{exposure}} to an avoidance schedule {{which included a}} <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> a rat was placed on a multiple schedule in which the first component {{was the same as}} before, i. e., a single response reset the response-shock interval, delaying shock, and the second component differed only in that four bar-presses were required to postpone shock. A fixed ratio requirement of four responses (FR 4) generated behavior resembling a fixed ratio requirement of one response (FR 1) since responding was controlled by the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> but more shocks were received. At a dosage of 2 mg/kg, methylphenidate given intraperitoneally decreased shock frequency during FR 4 periods while FR 1 behavior was not affected; at 4 mg/kg, stimulus control of avoidance responding was impaired during both components. Results at 4 mg/kg were partially confirmed by two animals exposed to an FR 4 avoidance schedule which included a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> but with different parameters. Response distributions showed that methylphenidate increased response rates {{in the absence of the}} <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> i. e., stimulus control of ratio-avoidance behavior was impaired although the increased response rates reduced shock frequency. One hour later responses again occurred more frequently during the signal than in its absence but shocks were less frequent than during control (non-drug) periods...|$|R
