5|$|In {{his book}} Popular Contemporary Writers, Michael D. Sharp {{describes}} Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> intelligible {{to a large}} audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in Slaughterhouse-Five and Slapstick.|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology {{have been based}} just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: {{it is hard to}} decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate Communication or Collaborative Communication) is a {{communication}} process developed by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which we see the beauty in the other person), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> likely to inspire compassion in others).|$|E

5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E
5|$|Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and {{authorities}} of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting {{and other aspects}} of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between {{the federal government and the}} other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility. In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E
5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} {{functional}} elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
