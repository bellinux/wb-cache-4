40|$|In this paper, an {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} understand the wear and frictional properties of kenaf fibre reinforced polyurethane composites. The effect of applied loads (30 to 80 N), sliding distance (up to 2. 7 km), and fibre orientation [i. e., parallel (P-O), anti-parallel (AP-O) and normal (N-O) ] were determined under dry and <b>wet</b> <b>contact</b> sliding. Specific wear rates for all fibre orientations improved under <b>wet</b> <b>contact</b> except parallel orientated composites. Presence of water in wet sliding has significantly reduced the friction coefficient compared to dry sliding besides acting as a cooling agent. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the worn surfaces and wear mechanism encountered. The predominant wear mechanism observed under dry sliding was micro-cracks, plastic deformation and thermo-mechanical deformation. Meanwhile, the worn surfaces under <b>wet</b> <b>contact</b> are very minimal, namely micro-ploughing at elevated sliding distances. ...|$|E

We got tunneling I-V characteristics for Hg/Si, while for Hg/Cu, I-V characteristics were ohmic. We explained tunneling I-V characteristics by presence of nanogap between the contact materials. Heat conductance of high wetting and low <b>wetting</b> <b>contacts</b> were compared, using calorimeter measurements. Heat conductance of high <b>wetting</b> <b>contact</b> was 3 - 4 times more than of low <b>wetting</b> <b>contact.</b> Both electric and thermal characteristics of liquid metal contact indicated {{that it could be}} used for thermotunneling devices.

These relays were fabricated with the MetalMUMPs foundry process, which has a 20 -µm-thick nickel structural layer. The operating voltage is under 0. 5 V. The mea-sured breakdown voltage and OFF-state resistance are greater than 200 V and 100 MΩ, respectively, and the gold-to-gold contact resistance is around 0. 3 Ω.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between wear and rolling contact fatigue in <b>wet</b> <b>contact</b> was investigated {{by means of}} experiments on a two-disc test bench. Specimens of various railway wheel steels were coupled with specimens of the same rail steel, subjected to rolling and sliding <b>wet</b> <b>contact</b> with varying sliding/rolling ratio. Some tests with a dry rolling-sliding contact phase preceding <b>wet</b> <b>contact</b> were carried out as well (dry-wet tests). The pressurization of the fluid entrapped in the surface cracks {{was the cause of}} a rapid and severe damage in the dry-wet tests, due to the nucleation of surface cracks by ratcheting in the dry phase, which subsequently propagate in the wet phase. In the wet tests, the fluid pressurisation effect was much mitigated due to the absence of initial surface cracks; the specimens subjected to higher sliding/rolling ratio showed the best performance against rolling contact fatigue, due to the effect of wear in reducing the length of surface cracks. A model for assessing the {{interaction between}} wear and rolling contact fatigue was proposed, based on the correction of the classical Paris law for crack propagation by taking into account the effect of wear on crack length reduction. The application of the model to the experimental tests allowed finding a correlation between the model predictions and the occurrence of fatigue failure...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, we have {{investigated}} self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) from alkanethiols on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) surfaces, which {{were used as}} an anode for thin-film devices prepared from the conductive copolymer so-called sulfonated poly(thiophene- 3 -[2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethoxy]- 2, 5 -diyl) (S-P 3 MEET). The assembled monolayers were characterized by using <b>wetting</b> <b>contact</b> angle, atomic force microscopy, and electrical measurements.

In addition, it was found similar values of <b>wetting</b> <b>contact</b> angle for dodecanethiol assembled on both FTO and Au surfaces. Concerning the thin-film device, current–voltage analysis revealed a hysteresis. This behavior was associated to a charge-trapping effect and also to structural changes of the SAMs. Finally, charge injection capability of tin oxide electrodes can be improved by using SAMs and then this approach can {{plays an important role}} in molecular-scale electronic devices...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The contact of two {{hydrophobic}} {{surfaces in}} water is of importance in biology, catalysis, material science, and geology. A tenet of hydrophobic attraction is {{the release of}} an ordered water layer, leading to a dry contact between two hydrophobic surfaces. Although the water-free contact has been inferred from numerous experimental and theoretical studies, {{this has not been}} directly measured. Here, we use surface sensitive sum frequency generation spectroscopy to directly probe the contact interface between hydrophobic poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and two hydrophobic surfaces (a self-assembled monolayer, OTS, and a polymer coating, PVNODC). We show that the interfacial structures for OTS and PVNODC are identical in dry contact but that they differ dramatically in <b>wet</b> <b>contact.</b> In water, the PVNODC surface partially rearranges at grain boundaries, trapping water at the contact interface leading to a 50 % reduction in adhesion energy compared to OTS−PDMS contact. The Young−Dupre ́ equation, used extensively to calculate the thermodynamic work of adhesion, predicts no differences between the adhesion energy for these two hydrophobic surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} thermocapillary {{deformation}} and film breakdown {{in a thin}} horizontal layer of viscous incompressible liquid with a free surface is considered. The deformable liquid layer is locally heated. The problem of thermocapillary deformation of the locally heated horizontal liquid layer has been solved numerically for two-dimensional unsteady case. The lubrication approximation theory is used. Capillary pressure, viscosity and gravity are taken into account. Evaporating rate {{is supposed to be}} proportional to the temperature difference between the liquid and ambient. Heat transfer in the substrate is also simulated. The numerical algorithm for the joint solution of the energy equation and the evolution equation for the thickness of liquid layer has been developed. The model predicts the thermocapillary deformation of the liquid surface and the formation of dry spots. The dynamics of liquid surface, the dry spots formation and the velocity of the contact line have been calculated. The deformation of the free surface has been calculated for different values of the heating power and thickness of the liquid layer. The effect of surface tension coefficient and <b>wetting</b> <b>contact</b> angle on the velocity of the contact line motion has been analyzed. It has been obtained that the velocity of the contact line increases with the increase of the <b>wetting</b> <b>contact</b> angle value and of the surface tension coefficient...|$|R

Rolling contact tests were performed with the same contact pressure, rolling speed and sliding/rolling ratio, varying the lubrication regime to simulate different climatic conditions. The samples, machined out of wheel rims at two depths within the re-profiling layer, were coupled with UIC 900 A rail steel samples. The wear rates, friction coefficients and hardness were correlated with the deformation beneath the contact surface. The crack morphology was studied and the damage mechanisms were identified.

Fruit kept in contact with pads saturated with low concentrations of detergents (Agral®, 0. 1 – 1 %; Amway LOC®, 0. 1 %) tended to develop etch at the perimeter of the contact area.

Two different types of OPRP composites were fabricated, which were based on treated and untreated oil palm fibres (treated oil palm fibre-reinforced polyester (T-OPRP) and untreated oil palm fibre-reinforced polyester (UT-OPRP), respectively). The experiments were conducted using two different techniques, pin-on-disc (POD) and block-on-ring (BOR), integrated into the same tribo-machine.
