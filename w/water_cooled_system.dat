50|$|It is {{generally}} {{a limitation of}} most cooling systems that the cooling fluid {{not be allowed to}} boil, as the need to handle gas in the flow greatly complicates design. For a <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>system,</b> this means that the maximum amount of heat transfer is limited by the specific heat capacity of water and the difference in temperature between ambient and 100°C. This provides more effective cooling in the winter, or at higher altitudes where the temperatures are low.|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} concepts for hypersonic experimental scramjet test vehicles which have low cost and low risk. Cryogenic hydrogen {{is used as}} the fuel and coolant. Secondary water cooling systems were designed. Three concepts are shown: an all hydrogen cooling system, a secondary open loop <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>system,</b> and a secondary closed loop <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>system.</b> The open loop concept uses high pressure helium (15, 000 psi) to drive water through the cooling system while maintaining the pressure in the water tank. The water flows through the turbine side of the turbopump to pump hydrogen fuel. The water is then allowed to vent. In the closed loop concept high pressure, room temperature, compressed liquid water is circulated. In flight water pressure is limited to 6000 psi by venting some of the water. Water is circulated through cooling channels via an ejector which uses high pressure gas to drive a water jet. The cooling systems are presented along with finite difference steady-state and transient analysis results. The {{results from this study}} indicate that water used as a secondary coolant can be designed to increase experimental test time, produce minimum venting of fluid and reduce overall development cost...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential for reducing the cooling systems’ environmental footprint with applications of alternative renewable energy source. Three types of cooling systems, water cooled, air cooled and a hybrid solar-based air-conditioning system, with a total of six scenarios were designed in this work. The scenarios accounted for the types of power supply to the air-conditioning systems with electricity from the grid and with a solar power from highly integrated building photovoltaics (BIPV). Within and between these scenarios, systems’ energy performances were compared based on energy modelling while the harvesting potential of the renewable energy source was further predicted based on building’s detailed geometrical model.

The RCCS can be a buoyancy driven air-cooled or <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>system.</b> The system under consideration in this investigation is an air-cooled system with an essentially U-tube configuration. It consists of an annular downcomer which is connected via a bottom-header to 220 risers. The downcomer and risers are connected to the atmosphere via inlet and outlet manifold systems respectively. In this study the entire system is simulated using two 1 D network codes, GAMMA+ and FLOWNEX, and a section of the reactor cavity is modelled in 3 D using the CFD code STARCCM+. The 3 D code is used to obtain the heat transfer coefficients for the surfaces in the reactor cavity, whilst the 1 D codes are used to study the performance of the RCCS subject to the radiative and convection heat transfer and atmospheric conditions. Both steady-state and transient conditions are modeled using the 1 D codes. The agreement between the results obtained with the two codes is good and serves as a verification of the methodologies that are used. In the transient simulations it has been found that the flow may reverse under certain atmospheric conditions.

40|$|Data centres are {{developing}} {{at a rapid}} pace with the continued increase in digital demands. Data centre cooling and energy efficiency is a growing topic of interest that requires new engineering solutions. To achieve both better cooling and higher efficiency, liquid-cooled computer systems are being considered {{as one of the}} best solutions. Total liquid cooled computers are not new, but with the power densities required for supercomputers have seen resurgence in liquid cooling, in particular solutions that do not require the use of air as a cooling medium. Recently the industry has developed an advanced fully immersed liquid-cooled data centre solution to fulfil this purpose. The core technology of the design is a liquid-cooled computer node (first cooling stage), which relies on density-driven, natural convection that has challenging engineering requirements. This thesis looks at the density-driven, natural convection from a different angle by simplifying the Navier-Stokes equations and Convection-Diffusion equation leading to the development of a Constant Thermal Gradient (CTG) model to solve the natural convection flow analytically. The CTG model yields algebraic solutions for velocity and temperature profiles, thereby it is able to give the flow characteristic length (l*) and indicate the boundary layer thickness directly. The development and usage of the CTG model is the academic achievement in this thesis, and it provides a clearer understanding of natural convection mechanism. This thesis also uses CFD simulation (ANSYS CFX) and laboratory experiment to analyse the heat transfer performance of the liquid-cooled system. A group of CFD simulations of a cavity convection problem has been carried out to find the appropriate approximation factor for the CTG model, hence completing the CTG model and make it ready for further analysis. A full scale CFD simulation has also been carried out to analyse the first cooling stage of the system for a given condition, and a real computer system has also been tested under the same condition. Then a three-step research work-flow has been developed to do heat transfer analysis on a natural convection based liquid-cooled system: CTG model, CFD simulation and experimental test. This thermal analysis work flow provides a knowledge base for further improvement in cooling design of the system, and this is the engineering achievement of this thesis. In order to see the thermal advantages of the fully-immersed liquid-cooled system, other intense real-world tests on the liquid-cooled system have been carried out. One of which is a benchmark test between an advanced back-door <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>system</b> and a fully-immersed liquid-cooled system; and such benchmark proves the thermal benefit of the fully liquid-cooled solution. The other benchmark is a series of real-world tests on a fully immersed liquid-cooled system which aim to achieve the ASHRAE W 5 standard, and it proves the practicality of the liquid-cooled solution. The benchmark test in this thesis was published in the Semi-Therm conference. ...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{energy costs}} {{initiated}} {{an investigation into}} refrigeration heat recovery as one conservation alternative available for reducing water heating costs on farm dairies. A theoretical energy balance was conducted, from which the potential of recovering refrigeration condenser heat was estimated at up to 60 % of the water heating energy requirements. Preliminary tests with heat exchangers lead {{to the use of}} a tube-in-tube, counter flow, heat exchanger with fins on the refrigerant side, and cores on the water side, to improve the heat transfer characteristics. The exchanger, designed to provide 300 litres of 60 °C water from a 2. 25 kw refrigeration system cooling 2000 litres of milk per day, had an area of 0. 84 m 2, and an overall thermal conductance of 100 W. m- 2. °C- 1. This heat exchanger was inserted between the compressor and condenser of the refrigeration plant and tested with two condenser systems (air and water), four condenser pressures (6. 5 bar, 7. 5 bar, 10 bar and 12 bar), two milk inlet temperatures(23 °C and l 8 °C), and two milk final temperatures (4 °C and 7 °C). In addition, tests on receiver pressure and suction superheat were performed to determine overall system performance. Increasing condenser pressure increased cooling times from 2 hours 32 minutes to 3 hours 17 minutes, after the completion of the 1200 litre morning milking (thus failing to comply with the 3 hour cooling regulation at high condenser pressures.) Also, C. O. P. decreased from 3. 05 to 2. 35 for the water cooled condenser system (2. 70 to 2. 00 for the air cooled condenser system due to fan power consumption). Gross heat recovery rose from 4. 2 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 8. l kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for the <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>system,</b> giving water outlet temperatures of 45 °C to 64 °C as condenser pressure rose. The corresponding ranges for air cooled condensers were 3. 8 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, to 6. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, and 38 °C to 55 °C. Changing milk inlet and final temperatures gave a proportional change in cooling times and total heat recovery, but had no effect on C. O. P. or heat recovery rates. Suction superheating increased total heat recovery by 15 %, and water outlet temperatures by 9 %. Increases in gross heat recovery with increasing condenser pressure were partially offset by additional compressor power, and yielded nett heat recoveries of 4. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 6. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for water cooled, and 3. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 4. 3 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for air cooled, condenser systems. The maximum gross and nett heat recoveries (at 12 bar condenser pressure) were applied to the energy requirements of a monitored 220 cow town supply dairy. This analysis showed that the gross heat recovery was 51 % of the water heating requirements, but the nett heat recovery dropped to 17 % of the total heating and refrigeration demand. Based on current electricity and equipment prices, it is estimated that the payback period for this level of recovery would be 16 - 17 years. Changing the electricity pricing structure, to reflect up to a 1 : 3 differential in favour of water heating power costs, results in the 6. 5 bar condenser pressure giving optimum results, but the nett returns are significantly lower than those reported. The potential for improved savings is greater from larger capacity systems as the capital investment is not proportionally increased with an increase in scale...|$|E
