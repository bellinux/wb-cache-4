However, Sigurd <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> and dealt a blow with his sword Gramr that ripped two teeth off Starkad's mouth. Sigurd then asked Starkad to go home.

25|$|He {{was born}} in the village of Santa Ana Chiautempan, Tlaxcala in 1858. He was a good student, but {{after the death of his}} father, he was obliged to quit school to work to {{maintain}} his mother and sister. Eventually he lived in Mexico City, where he was hired to do some carpentry work at the house of a wealthy family. Here met and fell in love with one of the young women there named Matilde. She was an orphan living with aunt and uncle at the house. He got her pregnant but never married her since he was poor. The family left to hide the pregnancy, stating that they would go on vacation to Europe. They returned two years later with a little girl named Dolores who they claimed they adopted in France. Chucho kidnapped the girl and took her to his sister’s house. However, the police <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> and he was forced to abandon his family.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has never}} been proven who {{actually}} fired the final shot into his ear, or determined whether this shot was made during the gunfight {{or as part of}} a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the subject. Some of Escobar's relatives believe that he had committed suicide. His two brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear. In a statement regarding the topic, the duo would state that Pablo [...] "had committed suicide, he did not get killed. During all the years they <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> he would say to me every day that if he was really cornered without a way out, he would 'shoot himself through the ear'." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "When we {{got them}} {{surrounded}} the fight was over in one hour. There was so much dust we could not see much, but the Indians rode around and yelled the war-whoop and shot into the soldiers {{as fast as they}} could until they were all dead. One soldier was running away to the east but Crazy Horse saw him and jumped on his pony and <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> He got him about half a mile from the place where the other soldiers were lying dead. The smoke was lifted so we could see a little. We got off our horses and went and took the rings and money and watches from the soldiers. We took some clothes off too, and all the guns and pistols. We got seven hundred guns and pistols. Then we went back to the women and children and got them together that were not killed or hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{situation}} among the Scottish loyalists had worsened, but only temporarily. England was regaining ground, and both Strathbogie and Robert Stewart surrendered to Edward III, Strathbogie so enthusiastically {{that he was}} later known for his tyranny against the loyalists. The remaining loyalists gathered at Dumbarton Castle, with the sole remaining regent, Sir Andrew Murray. To discuss terms, Murray and Edward III established a truce, which ultimately lasted from mid-October through Christmas, but the truce did not govern Balliol or Balliol's followers. When Strathbogie lay siege against Murray's wife at Kildrummy Castle, Murray <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> and {{with the assistance of}} the recently ransomed William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale, killed Strathbogie and routed Strathbogie's troops at the Battle of Culblean. It was the first of a number of victories against Balliol and his followers that gradually pushed Balliol to shelter in the shadow of the English king.|$|E
