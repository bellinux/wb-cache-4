500|$|So far, {{there have}} been two {{occasions}} in which no award has been presented.

500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend." ...|$|E

I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, what goes on in your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty? He said... he said... he said.... "Well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child. Now here she is, with a gun in her hand." ...|$|E

60|$|Still, {{there was}} this {{advantage}} in the old rigid forms, that they committed you to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward deed: when you have put your mouth to {{one end of a}} hole in a stone wall and are aware that there is an expectant ear at the other end, you are more likely to say what you came out with the intention of saying than if you were seated <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> in an easy attitude under the mahogany with a companion who will have no reason to be surprised if you have nothing particular to say.|$|E

[...] Dan laughed in forlorn {{perception}} of Boardman's affectionate irony. [...] "Little steps are the thing. You'll have to go in now and meet your family, and pass the time of day with each one, and talk about the weather, and account for my being along, and ask how they all are; and by the time you've had dinner, and got settled <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> {{out in front of the}} fire, you'll be just in the mood for it.

Eh? I see the fear of death in your eyes. You beat the air with your arms. You exert all your puny strength to struggle to live. Your hand is clutching my arm, lightly it feels as a butterfly resting there. Your chest is heaving, your tongue protruding, your skin turning dark, your eyes swimming. ‘To live! To live! To live!’ you are crying; and you are crying to live here and now, not hereafter. You doubt your immortality, eh? Ha! ha! You are not sure of it. You won’t chance it. This life only you are certain is real. Ah, it is growing dark and darker. It is the darkness of death, the ceasing to be, the ceasing to feel, the ceasing to move, that is gathering about you, descending upon you, rising around you. Your eyes are becoming set. They are glazing. My voice sounds faint and far. You cannot see my face. And still you struggle in my grip.

50|$|The step is done two {{different}} ways. One is more elaborate than the other.

5000|$|Air (Ollie) - {{similar to}} the skateboarding trick of the same name, or a bunny hop in BMX, it is {{possible}} to jump without utilizing the wake. By pushing down against the water with your knees and simultaneously pulling the handle in provides more tension on the rope. Then pulling upwards <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>legs,</b> you can make the entire board leave the water. If this is combined with 'jumping' the wake, much greater heights can be achieved.|$|E

Skilled riders can rotate as much as 1440 degrees or even more (there is no official record). Once the technique is perfected {{it allows you to}} rotate fast and slide very far while losing very little momentum due to the rider's weight being on his gloves when his board is sliding and on his board when it is pointing downhill and rolling.|$|E
