The bulk of that investment <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the private sector, with public investment playing a crucial role, especially in view of its facilitating and stimulating effect on private investment.|$|E
25|$|Charlie asks Sarah {{what she}} would do if Leslie went away and did not come back. Nancy becomes angry at him for asking. Sarah is upset by the {{question}} and wants {{to go back to the}} sea. Leslie hits and chokes Charlie for making Sarah cry. Leslie and Sarah decide to go back. Nancy tells them to stay because eventually they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back. Nancy, and to some degree Charlie, offer their help. Leslie accepts their offer.|$|E

When Charlie hurts Sarah—asking her {{what she would do}} if Leslie left and never came back—Leslie attacks him. After hitting him, Leslie nearly chokes him until the females intercede. After the incident, Leslie decides that he and Sarah will go back into the sea, to escape this threat. When Nancy tells him that they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back eventually and offers them help, it is Leslie who accepts this fate.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} promoted polemics regarding September Morn and censorship, {{and multiple}} editorial cartoons; one depicted {{a young woman}} bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading [...] "Don't you suppose I can imagine what is UNDER the water?". Comstock called the work [...] "demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young", arguing {{that it must be}} suppressed {{in the interest of the}} children. He emphasized that [...] "the law is the law... the picture <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of the window". Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach, explaining that [...] "so vivid a display of nudity as September Morn" [...] would best not be displayed in the United States, owing to the people's relative lack of appreciation for art.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Wolverine {{within the}} context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented: [...] "Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X-Men {{franchise}} on life support, but the filmmakers <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that [...] "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue." [...] On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's [...] "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" [...] is [...] "of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Borlaug, [...] "Africa, {{the former}} Soviet republics, and the cerrado {{are the last}} frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no {{additional}} sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless {{you are willing to}} level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".|$|E
