5|$|After {{playing out}} his option with the Steelers, in July 1966 Johnson {{signed as a}} free agent with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League. He joined the Oilers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of helping the team win an AFL championship. However, the team {{finished}} the season last in the Eastern Division with a record of 3–11. Johnson retired after the season at the age of 37. He completed his NFL career having carried 1,571 times for 6,803 yards and 48 touchdowns, and picked up 1,478 yards on 186 pass receptions for seven more scores.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviewing}} {{traffic conditions}} in 1961, the Ministry of Transport planned {{to improve the}} North Circular Road to a higher capacity, grade separating as many junctions as possible, particularly those at important arterial routes. In the 1960s the Greater London Council developed the London Ringways Plan to construct a series of circular and radial motorways throughout London <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> to ease traffic congestion in the central area. Under this plan the North Circular Road was to be improved to dual-carriageway standard throughout {{the majority of its}} length by the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{building}} housed {{a succession of}} tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because {{a sufficient number of}} local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As {{the building}} continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E
5|$|Allenby {{reviewed}} {{the threat of}} counterattack and his supply situation and decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills and a separate force to operate on the maritime plain could be maintained far from base. He decided to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of capturing Jerusalem. This would keep pressure on this army {{in the hope of}} denying them time to complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort {{was built}} in the early 16th century to protect the coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon. In the medieval period, the town's harbour, located in the estuary of the River Dart, was an {{important}} trading and fishing port, able to hold up to 600 vessels; it continued to prosper in the 15th century on the proceeds of the wool trade. Fears of a French invasion, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of retaining a valuable royal subsidy, led the town to develop Dartmouth Castle, {{on the west side of}} the estuary, into an artillery fort after 1486, with another fortification, Kingswear, being constructed the east side from 1491 onwards.|$|E

Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-10c was {{the first}} Kepler target to be {{observed}} using Spitzer <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of detecting a shallow transit dip in a light curve. At the time of Kepler-10c's discovery, Spitzer was the only facility capable of detecting shallow transits in the Kepler data to an extent at which the data could be meaningfully analyzed. The planet was also the third transiting planet that was validated through an analysis of statistical data (rather than actual observation), after the planets Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. In Kepler-10c's confirmation paper, the Kepler team discussed how a large fraction of planets in Kepler's field of view would be confirmed in this statistical manner.|$|E

Fears of a French invasion, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of retaining a valuable royal subsidy, led the town to develop Dartmouth Castle, {{on the west side}} of the estuary, into an artillery fort between 1486 and 1495.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} its life, {{there were}} plans for private {{interests}} to purchase Mir, possibly for use as the first orbital television/movie studio. The privately funded Soyuz TM-30 mission by MirCorp, launched on 4 April 2000, carried two crew members, Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr Kaleri, to the station for two months to do repair work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of proving that the station could be made safe. This was to be the last manned mission to Mir—while Russia was optimistic about Mir future, its commitments to the International Space Station project left no funding to support the aging station.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau hiked to {{the radio}} tower and changed the message from the numbers to a repeating {{distress}} call. Three days later, Rousseau {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Alexandra. One week after Alex's birth, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) came and took Alex from Rousseau. Ben told Rousseau that the child would be safe with them, and that she was lucky for being left alive. Before leaving, Ben tells her that if she hears whispers, she should run the other way. After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.|$|E

The ACG was tasked to deliver the core {{capabilities}} of Control of the Air and Precision Air Strike <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> that it would allow the RAAF to more quickly deploy its combat aircraft. Although the fighter and strike elements will continue to operate as discrete units for some time, ACG will provide the opportunity for the RAAF to test the organisation required to deliver a range of combat capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The Crawford {{expedition}}, {{also known}} as the Sandusky expedition and Crawford's Defeat, was a 1782 campaign on the western front of the American Revolutionary War, and one of the final operations of the conflict. Led by Colonel William Crawford, the campaign's goal was to destroy enemy American Indian towns along the Sandusky River in the Ohio Country, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of ending Indian attacks on American settlers. The expedition was one in a long series of raids against enemy settlements which both sides had conducted throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded {{as something of}} a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E
