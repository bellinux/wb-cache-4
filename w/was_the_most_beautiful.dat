Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.|$|E

25|$|Hera plays a {{substantial}} role in The Iliad, appearing {{in a number}} of books throughout the epic poem. In accordance with ancient Greek mythology, Hera's hatred towards the Trojans, which was started by Paris' decision that Aphrodite <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> goddess, is seen as through her support of the Greeks during the war. Throughout the epic Hera makes many attempts to thwart the Trojan army. In books 1 and 2, Hera declares that the Trojans must be destroyed. Hera persuades Athena to aid the Achaeans in battle and she agrees to assist with interfering on their behalf.|$|E

In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> place that I had ever seen in all my travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{by the end}} of May 1727, Elizabeth (aged 17) {{had lost}} her fiance and both of her parents; and furthermore, her half-nephew Peter II was on the throne. Her {{marriage}} prospects immediately dried up. They did not improve when, three years later, Peter II died and was succeeded by Elizabeth's first cousin, Empress Anna (ruled 1730-40), daughter of Peter the Great's elder brother Ivan V. The Chinese minister in St. Petersburg was asked by the Empress Anna who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> woman at her court, leading him to point to Elizabeth, much to Anna's intense displeasure. There was little love lost between the cousins and no prospect of either any Russian nobleman or any foreign prince seeking Elizabeth's hand in marriage. Nor could Elizabeth marry a commoner because it would cost her not only her title and royal status, but also her property rights and her claim to the throne.|$|E

MacRae was proud of the finished script, calling it his [...] "most accomplished piece of plotting ever". The original title of the episode was [...] "The Visitors' Room". This was changed to [...] "Visiting Hour" [...] and then [...] "Kindness". The episode, contrary to some reports, was never at any point titled [...] "The Green Anchor". [...] "The Girl Who Waited" [...] is a title that has been used to refer to Amy after she waited 12 years for the Doctor to return in [...] "The Eleventh Hour".

To augment the Nashville sound, Orbison requested a string section in the studio. With this combination, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was [...] "Uptown", written with Joe Melson. Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, [...] "We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> sound in the world." [...] The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll states that the music Orbison made in Nashville [...] "brought a new splendor to rock", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of Phil Spector.|$|E
2500|$|Helen – {{the proverbial}} [...] "Helen of Troy" [...] – {{exemplified}} both sexual passion and tremendous beauty for the Greeks. [...] She {{was the daughter}} of Zeus and Leda, the Queen of Sparta, and her beauty was the direct cause of the decade long Trojan War between Greece and Troy. The war began after the goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite asked Paris (a Trojan prince) to select who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> of the three. Each goddess tried to influence Paris’ decision, but he ultimately chose Aphrodite who then promised Paris the most beautiful woman. [...] Paris then traveled to Greece where he was greeted by Helen and her husband Menelaus. [...] Under the influence of Aphrodite, Helen allowed Paris to persuade her to elope with him. [...] Together they traveled to Troy, not only sparking the war, but also a popular and literary tradition of blaming Helen for her wrongdoing. [...] It is this tradition which Gorgias confronts in the Encomium.|$|E
2500|$|Smith, who was {{president}} of the board, travelled to Tennessee in 1878 and selected a site, engaged a surveyor to plot the town, and an architect to design a hotel there. The location, which Smith named Plateau City, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> he found. It overlooked river gorges, contained broad hills and had sweeping mountain vistas, but it was seven long miles from the railroad. By this time, the depression was ending, and unemployment was falling. A few Bostonians were reconsidering their investment in the venture, so Smith found additional investors through Thomas Hughes, the English social reformer. Hughes wanted to establish a utopian settlement for younger sons of English gentry which was classless, because class conventions in England prevented those born into high society from becoming tradesmen or farmers. In 1879, the [...] London Board of Aid to Land Ownership became the primary investors in the Tennessee project and renamed the colony Rugby. Smith thought that the key to growth was to become a resort, where guests would buy land and settle there. Hughes disagreed and refused to spend time or money on tourist endeavors. When Smith realized that his ideas was being ignored, he divested himself of the project in 1880 and took another trip abroad.|$|E
