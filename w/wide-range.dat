25|$|Limited-range drivers, {{also used}} alone, are {{typically}} found in computers, toys, and clock radios. These drivers are less elaborate {{and less expensive}} than <b>wide-range</b> drivers, {{and they may be}} severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.|$|E
25|$|They {{have a few}} (widely spaced) {{frequency}} ranges, {{and relatively}} <b>wide-range</b> continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.|$|E
25|$|Several {{organizations}} {{dedicated to}} saving Jews were created {{and run by}} Catholic Poles {{with the help of}} the Polish Jewish underground. Among those, Żegota, the Council to Aid Jews, was the most prominent. It was unique not only in Poland, but in all of Nazi-occupied Europe, as there was no other organization dedicated solely to that goal. Żegota concentrated its efforts on saving Jewish children toward whom the Germans were especially cruel. Tadeusz Piotrowski (1998) gives several <b>wide-range</b> estimates of a number of survivors including those who might have received assistance from Żegota in some form including financial, legal, medical, child care, and other help in times of trouble. The subject is shrouded in controversy according to Szymon Datner, but in Lukas' estimate about half of those who survived within the changing borders of Poland were helped by Żegota. The number of Jews receiving assistance who did not survive the Holocaust is not known.|$|E

2500|$|A {{full-range}} {{driver is}} a speaker {{designed to be}} used alone to reproduce an audio channel {{without the help of}} other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically [...] in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, <b>wide-range)</b> drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some computer speakers, etc. In hi-fi speaker systems, the use of <b>wide-range</b> drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of <b>wide-range</b> driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite <b>wide-range</b> drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures—such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns—to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low cost quarter wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.|$|E

Using our proposed decoding structure, only one sub-circuit will be activated when executing an instruction. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves on an average of 26. 71 % and 15. 69 % power reductions for the instruction decoder and the control unit, respectively. 1...|$|R
