5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> he considered marrying her. When {{she became pregnant}} in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E

They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E
