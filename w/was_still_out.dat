5|$|Harris {{was named}} to a 24-player {{preliminary}} roster for a two-game series in November 2010. Harris was then called into a six-day training camp in January 2011 in Carson, California {{leading up to the}} 2011 Four Nations Tournament. Because Solo <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> with a shoulder injury and Jill Loyden was out with a broken hand, Harris {{was named to}} the roster for the tournament to back-up Nicole Barnhart.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order {{to make up for the}} losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but the fire <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

5|$|On June 29, 2008, Edge faced Batista in a {{match for}} his title at Night of Champions. Due to {{interference}} from La Familia and a belt shot from Edge, {{he was able to}} defeat Batista. The next night on Raw, which happened a week after that year's draft lottery, Edge came out to gloat about his victory as well as the fact that, thanks to the draft, both the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship were both SmackDown property (Triple H, who was the reigning WWE Champion at the time, was drafted to SmackDown and had retained his title at Night of Champions as well). As Edge was leaving the ring, an angry Batista (who had been drafted back to Raw after three years as a SmackDown wrestler) came out and chased Edge back to the ring. He proceeded to assault Edge, finishing with a Batista Bomb in the ring. Just as Batista was leaving, CM Punk ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania XXIV, with referee Mike Chioda tagging along with him. Since Edge <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of it from the attack, he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was cashing in his contract. Once the bell rang, Punk simply hit Edge with a Go To Sleep and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|Sanath Jayasuriya <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> due to {{his injury}} {{sustained}} in his last game against India and Muttiah Muralitharan was rested. For India, Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Ashish Nehra took four wickets together and toiled away; another fell to a run-out, and Harbhajan Singh had Dilhara Lokuhettige caught behind for a six-ball duck. After 26 overs, Sri Lanka were 96/6, needing 125 from the last 24 overs. At the crease were Mahela Jayawardene and the number eight, Upul Chandana. They saw off Nehra, who finished with 2/22, and managed to get runs off other bowlers, such as part-timers Ganguly and Sehwag, who gave away 55 runs in 9 overs. The pair put on an unbeaten 126 for the seventh wicket to see their team home in 48 overs. Jayawardene finished at 94* and Chandana at 44*.|$|E

25|$|After the German {{offensive}} was halted, in the lull {{that followed}} the brigade {{took part in the}} Battle of Hamel in July and then later, after the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive in August 1918, they fought around Amiens, and the St Quentin Canal as the Hindenburg Line was broken. The fighting around the St Quentin Canal was the brigade's final involvement in the war, as the Australian Corps was withdrawn for rest and reorganisation in early October 1918, and <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of the line when the armistice was signed in November. For most of its duration on the Western Front, the brigade was commanded by Brigadier General Clarence John Hobkirk, a British officer originally from the Essex Regiment. During the war, four 14th Brigade soldiers received the Victoria Cross for their actions: William Currey, John Ryan, Alexander Buckley and Arthur Hall.|$|E
25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt where the AIF underwent {{a period of}} expansion and reorganisation. In March 1916, the 4th Battalion, {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Division, was transferred to the European theatre of operations where for the next two and a half years the battalion served in the trenches along the Western Front in France and Belgium. The battalion's first major action in France was at Pozières in July 1916. Later the battalion fought at Ypres, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme in winter, where they were used in a mainly defensive role. In 1918 the battalion helped to stop the German spring offensive in March and April. From 14–26 March Alick Bryant, who is believed to have been the youngest Australian soldier to serve during the war, was posted to the battalion while it fought in the Somme Valley. The battalion subsequently participated in the final Allied offensive of the war—the Hundred Days Offensive—which was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. The battalion continued operations to late September 1918, when the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation. The battalion <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{recorded}} [...] "Within You Without You" [...] for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, {{an album}} based around Paul McCartney's {{vision of a}} fictitious band that would serve as the Beatles' alter egos, after their decision to quit touring. Harrison {{had little interest in}} McCartney's concept; he later admitted that, following his return from India, [...] "my heart <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> there", and working with the Beatles again [...] "felt like going backwards". Harrison presented the song after it was decided to exclude his composition [...] "Only a Northern Song", which the Beatles recorded in February 1967. In contrast to his prominence as a songwriter on Revolver, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] was Harrison's sole composition on Sgt. Pepper.|$|E
500|$|As the {{political}} situation in Europe worsened in July 1914, the senior officer in Tsingtau at the time, Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) Karl von Müller, the commander of Emden, ordered the repair work to Cormoran to be accelerated. After the outbreak of war in early August, Emden captured the Russian steamer Ryazan and {{brought her back to}} Tsingtau. Since Cormoran <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of service, she was decommissioned and her crew was used to man Ryazan, which was commissioned as the auxiliary cruiser [...] Men from the gunboats [...] and , along with some war volunteers, joined them aboard the new auxiliary cruiser. Much of her weaponry was removed to strengthen the shore defenses at Tsingtau on 6 August 1914 to protect the concession from British attack. She was scuttled in the harbor on the night of 2829 September 1914 by the staff of the Imperial Dockyard to prevent her from being captured.|$|E
500|$|To {{complete}} Frederick's battle plan, the Prussians {{would have}} to descend from the Mühlberge to the lower Kuhgrund, cross the spongy field, and then assault the well-defended higher ground.

At {{this point in his}} plan, Frederick intended to have the second half of a pincer movement ready to squeeze the Russian left. [...] The [...] rearmost forces were supposed to have advanced straight against the Russians from the south, while the right wing did the same from the north. The right was where it was supposed to be, {{with the exception of one}} of the support formations for the right wing, which was held up by mis-information about the ground: a couple of bridges that crossed the Huhner Fleiss were too narrow for the artillery teams.

500|$|The core of New York's 1933 team {{returned}} intact in 1934 {{and they}} added talented quarterback Ed Danowski {{who had played}} collegiately at Fordham the previous year. Owen played Danowski sparingly, ignoring chants from the spectators for the quarterback. The New York fan base consisted of many Long Islanders and Fordham graduates who were eager to see Danowski play. Newman carried the ball a then-record 39 times in a 17–3 victory against Green Bay, but suffered a severe injury to his back in a late season game against Chicago, and his backup, Stu Clancy, <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> due to an elbow injury from a mid-season game. Because of these injuries, Danowski, by default, became the team's starting quarterback. The team finished 8–5, which placed them first in the Eastern Division.

The boat was decommissioned later that year, along with the first boat of the class, Rade Končar. The latter was sold to Kenya in 2014 for an undisclosed price. The Kenyan Navy plans on stripping the boat of its guns and fire-control systems which would then be overhauled and installed on the offshore patrol vessel KNS Jasiri. Rade Končar itself is then expected to be rebuilt and used by the Navy as a patrol boat. The fate of Hasan Zahirović-Laca remains unknown.|$|E
