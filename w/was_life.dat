In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene.

The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E
5|$|In John 1:1–8:38 Codex Sinaiticus {{differs from}} Vaticanus {{and all other}} Alexandrian manuscripts. It is in closer {{agreement}} with Codex Bezae {{in support of the}} Western text-type. For example, in John 1:4 Sinaiticus and Codex Bezae are the only Greek manuscripts with textual variant ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἐστίν (in him is life) instead of ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ᾓν (in him <b>was</b> <b>life).</b> This variant is supported by Vetus Latina and some Sahidic manuscripts. This portion has a large number of corrections.|$|E
5|$|With {{passenger}} numbers {{falling and}} the line extended to Nant Gwernol, the railway entered a period of consolidation. By 1987, the boiler on locomotive No. 6 Douglas <b>was</b> <b>life</b> expired {{and in need of}} replacement. Consideration was given to reviving the project to build a new locomotive from the components of Irish Pete instead of purchasing a new boiler for Douglas and in early 1988 work recommenced on the rebuilding of the ex-Bord na Mona locomotive. A new design for an 0-4-2 side tank locomotive was prepared by the railway's Chief Engineer John Bate, which reused the chassis and boiler from the locomotive with a new superstructure and the addition of trailing wheels, and the new locomotive, officially named Tom Rolt after the Preservation Society's first chairman, was put into service on 6 May 1991. During this period further expansions of both Tywyn Wharf and Pendre stations were undertaken and Abergynolwyn station, which had been rebuilt as part of the Nant Gwernol extension in the 1970s, was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at the eastern end of the line.|$|E

25|$|However, for the {{endurance}} races and the Australian Grand Prix support races, Perkins Engineering picked up significant sponsorship from Bob Jane T-Marts, {{and the car}} was painted yellow and blue, the colours of the T-Marts. Driving with Steve Harrington, Perkins proved there <b>was</b> <b>life</b> in the older model VL Commodore which won first time out in Bob Jane colours at the 1992 Don't Drink Drive Sandown 500 after a late race battle with the BMW M3 Evolution of Tony Longhurst and Paul Morris. Perkins then sensationally put the Commodore onto the front row for the 1992 Tooheys 1000 at Bathurst, but alternator and tyre problems in the rainstorms that marred the race (and eventually caused its early finish) saw them eventually finish in 9th place. While driving the older VL, Perkins also pointed out during the top ten runoff at Bathurst that the only 'old' thing about the car was its superseded body shape. The speed of the Perkins VL at Bathurst {{raised questions about the}} legality of the car, though {{it should be noted that}} Perkins' qualifying time of 2:14.08 was only 0.74 seconds faster than he had qualified in 1990. Also, in that same time period other cars such as the Sierra's and the 4WD, twin-turbo Nissan GTR had also improved their own lap times at Bathurst by around 2–3 seconds per lap.|$|E

According to Priscilla Frank, writing for The Huffington Post, Cameron's artwork merges [...] "Crowley's occult with the surrealism and symbolism of French poets, yielding dark yet whimsical depictions buzzing with otherworldly power". The art curator Philippe Vergne described her work as being on [...] "the edge of surrealism and psychedelia", embodying [...] "an aspect of modernity that deeply doubts and defies cartesian logic at a moment in history when these values have shown their own limitations".|$|E

These included the concept of warning colouration in animals, and the Wallace effect, a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He {{was also one of the}} first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there <b>was</b> <b>life</b> on Mars.|$|E

Director Rob Epstein spoke later about why he chose the subject of Milk's life: [...] "At the time, {{for those of us who}} lived in San Francisco, it felt like it <b>was</b> <b>life</b> changing, that all the eyes of the world were upon us, but in fact most of the world outside of San Francisco had no idea.

500|$|To Spielberg, {{the black}} and white {{presentation}} of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: [...] "The Holocaust <b>was</b> <b>life</b> without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white." [...] Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety {{can be seen as a}} metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in Nazi Germany between making use of the Jews for slave labor or exterminating them outright. Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a Holocaust train loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.|$|E

500|$|Store Frøen's rural {{surroundings}} {{shaped the}} nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice {{at the age of}} two, on improvised skis. [...] At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby Huseby installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: [...] "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... hen I came down again I bored into the snow up to my waist. The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there <b>was</b> <b>life</b> in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." [...] Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of Telemark, where a new style of skiing was being developed. [...] "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.|$|E

He also identifies its [...] "trailblazing" [...] quality as the impetus for Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and for Brian Wilson to complete the Beach Boys' [...] "mini-symphony", [...] "Good Vibrations". Citing composer and producer Virgil Moorefield's book The Producer as Composer, author Jay Hodgson highlights Revolver as representing a [...] "dramatic turning point" [...] in recording history through its dedication to studio exploration over the [...] "performability" [...] of the songs, as this and subsequent Beatles albums reshaped listeners' preconceptions of a pop recording. In his review for Pitchfork, Plagenhoef says that the album not only [...] "redefin what was expected from popular music", but recast the Beatles as [...] "avatars for a transformative cultural movement". MacDonald cites Revolver as a musical statement that helped guide the counterculture towards the 1967 Summer of Love due to the widespread popularity of the Beatles.|$|E
