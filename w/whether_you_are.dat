She added that while Christian missionaries would understand Feri as a [...] "sex cult", [...] "we do not behave {{like a bunch of}} slavering mad dogs in heat". Initiation into Feri was a sexual act, and according to Cora [...] "in initiation you literally marry the Goddess, her dual consort and the Gods, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> male or female". It involved a male priest giving the female initiate the names of the God and Goddess upon orgasm. If the female initiate was already betrothed to another, or did otherwise not wish to have intercourse with the priest, then a ritual known as the Intentions of the Heart took place. In this, her next sexual act with another person would be considered her initiation. When a female initiated a male, there was a similarly sexual component although according to Cora, [...] "there are some important differences".|$|E

[...] The reformists, following the Gathas as their prime guide, judge the Vendidad harshly as being a deviation from the non-prescriptive, abstract teachings of the Gathas. For them, few if any of the laws or practices in the Vendidad are either in the spirit or the letter of the Gathas, and so they are not to be followed. The reformists prefer to regard the Vendidad as a document which has no religious value but is only of historic or anthropological interest. Many Zoroastrians, in Iran, India, and the world diaspora, inspired by reformists, have chosen to dispense with the Vendidad prescriptions entirely or only to follow those which they believe are not against the original spirit of the Gathas." ...|$|E
