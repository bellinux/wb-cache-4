40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{internet}} took {{off as a}} data network for sending email and browsing websites. The option of putting voice traffic on to the net has been in consideration ever since internet was able to transmit media. This is otherwise called Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). VoIP is implemented in Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANET) but its range is considerably small. This leads to congestion and improper Quality of Service (QoS). Current implementation of VoIP over MANET has issues like hidden and exposed terminal problems. In order for MANET to expand its connectivity, there {{should be at least}} one node within its range. As the range of MANET is a disadvantage, distant connectivity is an issue. In this paper, a method has been proposed to use mobile <b>Wireless</b> – <b>Fidelity</b> (Wi-Fi) hotspot instead of MANET for VoIP. For this, mobile nodes are connected within a range of a hotspot network (100 ft.) for audio transmission. This scenario would be simulated using both mobile hotspot and MANET and the results are compared for better understanding. Main aspects like efficient data transmission, QoS and security are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|We study {{adaptive}} network coding (NC) for scheduling real-time traffic over a single-hop wireless network. To {{meet the}} hard deadlines of real-time traffic, {{it is critical}} {{to strike a balance between}} maximizing the throughput and minimizing the risk that the entire block of coded packets may not be decodable by the deadline. Thus motivated, we explore adaptive NC, where the block size is adapted based on the remaining time to the deadline, by casting this sequential block size adaptation problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. One interesting finding is that the optimal block size and its corresponding action space monotonically decrease as the deadline approaches, and the optimal block size is bounded by the "greedy" block size. These unique structures make it possible to narrow down the search space of dynamic programming, building on which we develop a monotonicity-based backward induction algorithm (MBIA) that can solve for the optimal block size in polynomial time. Since channel erasure probabilities would be time-varying in a mobile network, we further develop a joint real-time scheduling and channel learning scheme with adaptive NC that can adapt to channel dynamics. We also generalize the analysis to multiple flows with hard deadlines and long-term delivery ratio constraints, devise a low-complexity online scheduling algorithm integrated with the MBIA, and then establish its asymptotical throughput-optimality. In addition to analysis and simulation results, we perform high <b>fidelity</b> <b>wireless</b> emulation tests with real radio transmissions to demonstrate the feasibility of the MBIA in finding the optimal block size in real time.

30|$|While current {{wireless}} {{local area}} network (WLAN) implementations reach the <b>wireless</b> <b>fidelity</b> (WiFi) consumer market with triple-band demand, optical wireless communications (OWC), specifically those based on indoor visible light communication (VLC) technology or light fidelity (LiFi), possess a broad spectrum and ubiquitous layout. When used for WLAN, VLC [1] utilizes a light-emitting diode (LED) to transmit visible light data. From the physical layer to the network layer, studies on VLC have gradually explored networking issues related to the design and maintenance of VLC networks. VLC links have directionality and vulnerability characteristics, owing to the straight propagation and common obstruction of visible light, respectively. Therefore, research on VLC networking encounters several challenges related to these characteristics that differ from those of either <b>wireless</b> <b>fidelity</b> or femtocell networks, such as illuminant layout design, VLC multi-user access, visible light channel resource allocation, and mobility management.|$|E
