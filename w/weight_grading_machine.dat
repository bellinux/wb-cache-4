The analysis of the given data shows that changing <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> settings can reduce the probability of failure of a structure in where the graded timber is to be used by up to approximately 25 % at lower grades, and up to approximately 15 % at higher grades.

Comparing a <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> with a relatively high degree of accuracy to a machine with a relatively low degree of accuracy shows that the use of the <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> with the lower accuracy gives a probability of failure that is up to 750 % higher than that of the more accurate one...|$|R

40|$|AbstractImprovement {{of quality}} and value {{addition}} of agricultural produces has gained higher concern in recent times in Sri Lanka due to creation of new opportunities for sale of agricultural commodities in open market at competitive prices. Grading according to the sizes is an important value adding technique for most agricultural products. And also {{the price of the}} many agricultural products varies significantly according to their uniformity in size. Uniformity in size not only makes the produce more attractive to consumers but also improve its processing qualities. At present, size grading of most agricultural crops including big onion are carried out manually by crop collectors, whole sellers and retail sellers, most of farmers market their products without any grading. In Sri Lanka, persons engaging in post-harvest crop handling such as collectors, whole sellers, retail sellers, and farmers have less chance to use high technical and costly grading technique. And also local market survey reported, retail market price of the big onion bulbs are significantly varied according to its size. Hence, this research study attempted to design and development of a low cost size <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> for size <b>grading</b> of big onion bulbs. Size <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> was fabricated by cast iron and PVC tube and It was designed for grading of onion bulbs into three sizes i. e. small (φ 6 cm). <b>Grading</b> <b>machine</b> was also fabricated to operate either by manual or electric motor.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the applicability of the WLGS by confirming its prognostic validity, evaluating its relationship to cachexia domains, and exploring its ability to predict cachexia progression. Methods An international, prospective observational study of patients with incurable cancer was conducted. For each patient, <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> was scored 0 – 4. <b>Weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> 0 represents a high BMI with limited weight loss, progressing through to <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> 4 representing low BMI and a high degree of weight loss. Survival analyses were used to confirm prognostic validity. Analyses of variance were used to evaluate the relationship between the WLGS and cachexia domains [anorexia, dietary intake, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and physical and emotional functioning]. Cox regression was used to evaluate if the addition of cachexia domains to the WLGS improved prognostic accuracy. Predictive ability of cachexia progression was assessed by estimating proportion of patients progressing to a more advanced <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade.</b> Results One thousand four hundred six patients were analysed (median age 66 years; 50 % female, 63 % KPS ≤ 70). The overall effect of the WLGS on survival was significant as expressed by change in − 2 log likelihood (P < 0. 001) and persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and cancer type and stage (P < 0. 001). Median survival decreased across the <b>weight</b> loss <b>grades</b> ranging from 407 days (95 % CI 312 – 502) —weight loss grade 0 to 119 days (95 % CI 93 – 145) —weight loss grade 4. All cachexia domains significantly deteriorated with increasing <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade,</b> and deterioration was greatest for dietary intake, with a difference corresponding to 0. 87 standard deviations between <b>weight</b> loss <b>grades</b> 0 and 4. The addition of KPS, anorexia, and physical and emotional functioning improved the prognostic accuracy of the WLGS. Likelihood of cachexia progression was greater in patients with <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> 2 (39 %) than that with <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> 0 (19 %) or 1 (22 %).

40|$|Different {{molecular}} <b>weight</b> <b>grades</b> of poly(DL-lactic acid) {{were applied}} as release controlling excipients in tablets for oral drug administration. The role of molecular weight and glass transition in {{the mechanism of}} water-induced volume expansion and drug release of PDLA tablets was investigated. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) {{was used to determine}} the glass transition temperature of both dry and hydrated PDLA samples. The absorption rate and total amounts of sorbed water by the polymer were determined by dynamic vapour sorption (DVS). Expansion behaviour of PDLA tablets was measured using thermal mechanical analysis (TMA). At 95 % relative humidity all molecular <b>weight</b> <b>grades</b> of PDLA sorbed 1. 1 - 1. 3 % w/w water, as was determined with DVS. MDSC showed glass transition temperature reductions of 10 - 11 °C for all molecular <b>weight</b> <b>grades</b> of PDLA in water. Volume expansion studies using TMA showed that the molecular relaxation time and equilibrium porosity of the tablets increased with molecular weight. The mean relaxation time increased exponentially with the temperature interval Tg-T. The onset temperature of shape recovery of hydrated tablets was approximately 8 °C lower than for dry samples. Drug release was only slightly affected by molecular weight. It is concluded that volume expansion of compressed PDLA tablets is related to the glass transition behaviour, originates from water-induced and thermally stimulated shape memory behaviour and is therefore highly dependent on the molecular weight of PDLA. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

This {{can be achieved by}} different approaches that are represented in the current standard and pre-standard. The pre-standard defines a parametric and non-parametric calculation of characteristic properties from test results, which is the essential difference between various approaches. In both the non-parametric approach and the standard procedure, some simplifications and adjustment factors are used while in the parametric calculation only equations from a theoretical background are used. Procedures are derived for eight different strength grade combination and for all results comparisons are made. With the Mathematica software we used simulations to test given equations for the calculation of characteristic properties. Special consideration was taken on the non-parametrical calculation. The correction factor equation has not proved to be suitable, at least not for the assumptions that are made in the pre-standard. Therefore, we produced a new equation, which gives better results. A new strength <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> is under development, which is not yet standardized and cannot formally be used for strength grading and CE marking yet.
