5|$|While in England, Godwin took {{a course}} in {{creative}} writing at the City Literature Institute, where she met her second husband, psychiatrist Ian Marshall. They were married two months later. The marriage was brief and they were divorced in 1966. After their breakup, Godwin returned to the United States. At age 29, she {{took a job as}} fact-checker in New York City for The Saturday Evening Post. She said the job <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> because {{she wanted to be a}} writer, as opposed to fact-checking the work of others.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, {{on the grounds that they}} had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The brutality of the incident <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Test in Sydney, Johnson and Miller {{were both}} {{unavailable}} due to injury; Morris {{led the team}} for the second and final time in Tests. The Australian Board of Control made the surprising move of appointing the young and inexperienced Richie Benaud as Morris' vice-captain for the match. Benaud, selected as a batsman, had scored just 195 runs at 13.92 in ten Test matches and was not a regular member of the team. Benaud noted that the situation <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and that Morris had asked him not to be offended if he sought advice from veteran players Ray Lindwall and Harvey, who had been Test regulars for seven years. Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a green pitch, in a match marred by time-wasting. Although Australia took a first innings lead, they lost the low-scoring match by 38 runs after a batting collapse {{in the face of}} a Tyson pace barrage on the final day. Aided by a powerful tailwind, Tyson bowled at extreme pace and the slips cordon stood 45m away from the wicket. Morris had a poor personal performance, scores of 12 and 10, a disappointment amidst his team's defeat. He failed to pass 25 in either of the following Tests as Australia fell 3–1 behind with a hat-trick of losses and he was dropped for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 223 runs at 31.86. Aside from the First Test century, Morris struggled throughout the entire season, passing fifty on only one other occasion and managing only 382 runs at 31.83.|$|E

25|$|Cleese {{was born}} in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, {{the only child of}} Reginald Francis Cleese (1893–1972), an {{insurance}} salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (née Cross; 1899–2000). His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School, where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing. When he was 13, he was awarded an exhibition at Clifton College, an English public school in Bristol. He was already more than 6feet (1.83m) tall by then.|$|E
25|$|Boniface I {{joined the}} Fourth Crusade as a Christian leader in 1203. In {{accordance}} with promises made to Asti and Alessandria, he officially abdicated the marquisate to William before he left. Immediately, William turned towards Asti, then protected by Milan. The Astigiani {{had a history}} of rebellion and were growing in power. In August, with his father beside him, he formed an alliance with Alba and Alessandria, another rebellious commune, against Asti. His allies proved of little worth as he had to make many concessions to them and was still defeated in the field. In April 1206, he opened negotiations with Asti. The peace treaty <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for Montferrat, but it was accepted by all three allies. William promised to get his father's ratification, but his father was killed fighting against the Bulgarians unaware of any peace back home.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks about cunnilingus, where Madonna compares her vaginal fluids to holy water, juxtaposing Christian imagery with sexuality. [...] "Holy Water" [...] divided music critics; some deemed it a {{standout}} {{and one of}} the most scandalous tracks of Madonna's career, while others felt it <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and over the top. The song was included on the set list of her Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). The performance contained dancers dressed as nuns, the singer gyrating around the cross while standing on a dancer and a reenactment [...] of the Last Supper. It was target of controversies in Singapore, where Madonna excluded it from the setlist and was criticized by the Catholic Church.|$|E

To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the [...] "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."

500|$|Cope {{was raised}} as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their {{religious}} views, Osborn writes that Cope {{was at least}} aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: [...] "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible... he did not express them in his letters to his family but {{there can be little}} question... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period." [...] Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father's death) <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than his true views.|$|E
500|$|Hedren gave Spoto {{an account}} of the {{director}} as a sexual predator for his 1983 book, The Dark Side of a Genius (1983). Spoto wrote that Hitchcock made [...] "an overt sexual proposition that she could neither ignore nor answer casually." [...] Hedren alleged in Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, that Hitchcock actually asked her to [...] "make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted." [...] Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to. She said: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and insulting—there were a lot of reasons why I didn’t want to tell the story. I didn’t want it to be taken advantage of, twisted, turned and made into an even uglier situation than it was. It wasn’t until years later that I told Donald the story. (...) He is absolutely true and honest in this book." [...] She previously said, in 1973, while Hitchcock was still alive, that a major life-style difference caused a split in their relationship. [...] "He was too possessive and too demanding. I cannot be possessed by anyone. But, then, that's my own hangup." ...|$|E

500|$|The first Soviet {{atomic bomb}} test in August 1949 <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to the British (who had not {{expected}} a Soviet atomic weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, but {{it was for the}} Americans another reason for cooperation. The agreement on raw materials was due to expire {{at the end of the}} year. The Americans offered to make bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to end their atomic bomb programme. This offer was rejected on the grounds that it was not [...] "compatible with our status as a first class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance." [...] Instead, the British suggested that there would be a full exchange of atomic information, and in return for ending the production of atomic bombs in Britain, American bombs would be stored in Britain under British control. This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. The opposition of several key officials, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss, and Senators Bourke B. Hickenlooper and Arthur Vandenberg, coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, as a Soviet spy, caused the proposal to be rejected.|$|E
500|$|Milian's third studio album, So Amazin', was {{released}} on May 16, 2006. The album's lead single, [...] "Say I", featured rapper Young Jeezy. The single saw peak positions of number four in the UK, and number twenty-one in the US. So Amazin debuted and peaked at number eleven on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 54,000 copies in its first week and 163,000 copies in total. Internationally, the album peaked at number 55 on the Swiss Albums Chart, 67 on the UK Albums Chart, and 139 on the France Albums Chart. Reviews of So Amazin were mixed; critics felt that while Milian claimed that she was displaying the various sides of her personality, the album could [...] "only [...] the surface of who she really is." [...] "Say I" [...] was praised by several critics, and was described as [...] "instantly rousing" [...] and [...] "intoxicating". In June 2006, Milian's representative confirmed {{that she had been}} dropped by Island Def Jam. In an interview with Rap-Up, Milian revealed she was dropped a week after her album {{was released}}. The singer believed it was a [...] "budget cut", and that Island Def Jam Music Group wanted to spend more money on label mate Rihanna. She said, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> It was a week after my album got put out. I would be in my room {{a lot of the time}} crying by myself." [...] After leaving Def Jam, Milian released her first compilation album, The Best of Christina Milian (2006).|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

Although they would soon have their own nuclear capability, the British proposed that instead of building their own uranium-enrichment plant they would send most of their scientists to work in the US, as well as plutonium from Windscale. While Britain would not formally give up building or researching its own weapons, the United States would manufacture all bombs and allocate some to Britain.|$|E

2500|$|... 1979 {{proved to}} be the year in which Lynch finally {{realised}} that his grip on power had slipped. The first direct elections to the European Parliament took place in June saw the electorate severely punish the ruling Fianna Fáil party. A five-month postal strike also led to deep anger amongst people all over the country. On 27 August 1979 the Provisional IRA assassinated Earl Mountbatten of Burma in County Sligo. On the same day the IRA killed 18 British soldiers at Warrenpoint in County Down. A radical security review and greater cross-border co-operation were discussed with the new British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. These discussions led Síle de Valera, a backbench TD, to directly challenge the leadership in a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at Fermoy on 9 September. Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held at 28 September, de Valera correctly pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding the North which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from the north. The result <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for Lynch.|$|E
