40|$|Recovered {{paper is}} the most {{important}} raw material in the world for the production of paper and paperboard (Hoke, 2009). The availability of recycled fibre is coming under pressure from competition for biomass for different uses, such as construction materials, biorefinery applications and the production of energy (Hoke, 2009). As the demand for secondary fibre increases, paper made with wet strength resins are becoming a more important source of fibre. Currently, <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>paper</b> entering traditional recycled paper mills ends up in the waste stream (Hoke, 2009). So not only is this a lost opportunity, but also a significant processing cost for its removal and disposal. Therefore it will become increasingly necessary to ensure that wet strength products are firstly removed from comingled recycling streams, and then secondly utilised in an economical manner. This investigation used a wet strength product, Coated Carrier Board (CCB) from Amcor Cartonboard Petrie Mill to investigate variables including chemical type, chemical concentration, temperature and pulping time with the aim of studying the process economics using conventional equipment and chemicals. Pulp tests include Canadian Standard Freeness, visual assessment and rejects %wt. Experimentation was completed in three stages, Scoping Laboratory Trials to investigate chemical types, Laboratory Trials to investigate the effects of variables and finally Industrial Pilot Scale Trials to observe real world effects. This study has presented an experimental methodology, investigated the effect of variables, and then considered their economic outcome. Finally, and most importantly it has been demonstrated that {{there is more than one}} way to achieve a desired rejects level. By observing the line of fit for the lowest cost for reject level, these optimum combinations can be selected on their merit on the basis of other operational aspects. Anecdotal evidence of the usable nature of the pulp was gained in industrial pilot scale trials. Use of chemical aids was found to be necessary for repulping CCB to achieve satisfactory rejects levels. Hydrogen peroxide was ineffective at repulping, expensive and hazardous. Hypo produced successful repulping results in tap water, however did not in mill white water, these were therefore eliminated as candidates. Potassium Persulphate used in conjunction with Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda) exhibited a small but positive effect in laboratory trials, however failed to provide a positive effect in industrial pilot scale trials, therefore suggesting it is not an effective additive for CCB repulping. Of the chemical combinations trialled, it was therefore concluded that Caustic Soda was most effective and economical. The experimentation undertaken successfully observed the effects of the selected variables on rejects level. It was observed that time had the greatest and most consistent effect on reducing reject content. In Laboratory trials from 10 mins to 20 mins pulping caused an approximate 75 percent reduction in rejects and this was repeated in Industrial Pilot Scale Trials with thirty to ninety minute trials exhibiting approximately the same reduction. The repulping process was determined to follow first order kinetics with respect to rejects %wt. It was also established that even though the addition of chemicals and increased temperature contributes to increased cost per Accepts Tonne, when aiming for low rejects level these costs are necessary. Increasing pulping time, therefore energy, was found to have the greatest effect and paid for itself up to approximately 550 kWh/Tonne. The variable of second greatest effect was temperature, where an approximately 50 percent reduction of rejects was observed from 45 °C to 75 °C. In the social, economic and environmental climate requiring increasing use of recycled feedstock, it is an important result that repulping <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>paper</b> is feasible with existing paper mill recycling equipment and commercially available chemicals, and can likely be done below the cost of traditional wastepaper...|$|E

The adsorption behavior could not be accounted for {{solely on the basis}} of electrostatic interactions; thus a specific interaction between the polymers existed. Swelling and viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed chitosan layer were strongly influenced by pH. At high pH, the layer deswelled and became more elastic due to insolubility of the chitosan. The colloidal probe force measurements showed a rise of electrosteric repulsion after adsorption of chitosan at pH 5. Above the solubility limit of the chitosan, at pH 7, the pull-off force and its range clearly increased compared to lower pH values, indicating that the wet adhesion between chitosan-coated cellulose surfaces increased.

The acetylation treatment was carried out on paper sheets and pulp samples. Effect of liquid phase acetylation on optical and mechanical properties of bagasse chemimechanical paper sheets was evaluated. The obtained results also indicated that acetylation is a reliable method to eliminate phenolic hydroxyl groups. Paper made from unbleached CMP increased in brightness (up to 10 percentage units) on acetylation, while the hydrogen peroxide bleached paper decreased in bright-ness.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to identify the effects of different factors on the tension and tension relaxation of wet paper web after high-speed straining. The study was motivated by the plausible connection between wet web mechanical properties and wet web runnability on paper machines shown by previous studies. The mechanical properties of wet paper were examined using a fast tensile test rig with a strain rate of 1000 %/s. Most of the tests were carried out with laboratory handsheets, but samples from a pilot paper machine were also used. The tension relaxation of paper was evaluated as the tension remaining after 0. 475 s of relaxation (residual tension). The tensile and relaxation properties of wet webs {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on the quality and amount of fines. With low fines content, the tensile strength and residual tension of wet paper was mainly determined by the mechanical interactions between fibres at their contact points. As the fines strengthen the mechanical interaction in the network, the fibre properties also become important. Fibre deformations caused by the mechanical treatment of pulp were shown to reduce the mechanical properties of both dry and wet paper. However, the effect was significantly higher for wet paper. An increase of filler content from 10 % to 25 % greatly reduced the tensile <b>strength</b> of dry <b>paper,</b> but did not significantly impair <b>wet</b> web tensile <b>strength</b> or residual tension. Increased filler content in wet web was shown to increase the dryness of the wet web after the press section, which partly compensates for the reduction of fibrous material in the web. It is also presumable that fillers increase entanglement friction between fibres, which is beneficial for <b>wet</b> web <b>strength.</b> Different contaminants present in white water during sheet formation resulted in lowered surface tension and increased dryness after wet pressing. The addition of different contaminants reduced the tensile strength of the dry paper. The reduction of dry <b>paper</b> tensile <b>strength</b> could not be explained by the reduced surface tension, but rather on the tendency of different contaminants to interfere with the inter-fibre bonding. Additionally, <b>wet</b> web <b>strength</b> was not affected by the changes in the surface tension of white water or possible changes in the hydrophilicity of fibres caused by the addition of different contaminants. The spraying of different polymers on wet paper before wet pressing had a significant effect on both dry and <b>wet</b> web tensile <b>strength,</b> whereas <b>wet</b> web elastic modulus and residual tension were basically not affected. We suggest that the increase of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>paper</b> <b>strength</b> could be affected by the molecular level interactions between these chemicals and fibres. The most significant increases in dry and <b>wet</b> <b>paper</b> <b>strength</b> were achieved with a dual application of anionic and cationic polymers. Furthermore, selectively adding papermaking chemicals to different fibre fractions (as opposed to adding chemicals to the whole pulp) improved the wet web mechanical properties and the drainage of the pulp suspension...|$|R

Hereby paper products that require high <b>wet</b> <b>strength,</b> such as kitchen towels and bank note paper, are achieved. This study aims to examine new polymers for future use as wet-strength additive in paper. One of them, a natural biopolymer, has in earlier studies proved to work well as <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> additive. The objective was to find out in what extent this biopolymer could improve <b>wet</b> <b>strength.</b> A final evaluation was based on mechanical testing of sheets made from bleached Kraft fibres modified by the biopolymer. Wet-strength polymers are used to develop or conserve the mechanical <b>strength</b> of <b>paper</b> when <b>wetted.</b> Wet-strength agents are added in various paper products such as: hand towels, hygiene paper and packaging grades. According to the chemical composition of these agents they can act either as protective agents by preventing fibre swelling and protecting already existing bonds, or they form new and water resistant bonds through reinforcement mechanisms.

This fact together with the reactive functions of the biopolymer probably makes it possible to adsorb it to cellulose fibres. Pre-treatments of fibres were done by adding 0. 5 and 2 % biopolymer to the paper pulp. The adsorption was evaluated by measuring the surface charge of pre-treated fibres. This most popular wet-strength today is PAE (poly(aminoamide) - epichlorohydrin)) but it has some drawbacks.

The increase in pressure sum, Lyocell blend ratio, or basis weight results in increasing the <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> of materials. In spite of different basis weights, materials possess similar dispersibility at the pressure sums from 80 to 135 bars. Beyond the pressure sum of 135 bars, material basis weight has significant influence on the required dispersion cycles. The increase in Lyocell content leads to decrease the flush tube cycles and the required flush tube cycles increase slowly under the pressure sum of 210 bars. But above this pressure sum, the cycles for material dispersion increase sharply and the increase in Lyocell content results in increasing the dispersion cycles. Meanwhile, pressure sums have positive linear relationship with material <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> and exponential relationship with material dispersibility.
