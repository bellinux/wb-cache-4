40|$|United Nations (UN) peacekeepers tend to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> to ‘hard-to-resolve’ civil wars. Much less {{is known}} about where peacekeepers <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> within a country. However, to assess peacekeepers’ {{contribution}} to peace, it matters whether they <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> to conflict or relatively safe areas. This article examines subnational UN peacekeeping deployment, contrasting an ‘instrumental’ logic of deployment versus a logic of ‘convenience’. These logics are evaluated using geographically and temporally disaggregated data on UN peacekeepers’ deployment in eight African countries between 1989 and 2006. The analysis demonstrates that peacekeepers <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> on the frontline: they go where conflict occurs, {{but there is a}} notable delay in their deployment. Furthermore, peacekeepers tend to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> near major urban areas...|$|R
