In a 2010 letter to The New York Post, he asserted that his draft bore {{little resemblance to the}} final script; the result, he said, was embarrassing: [...] "The only time I saw the movie was at the premiere, which was one too many times." [...] In Better Living Through Bad Movies, Scott Clevenger and Sheri Zollinger wrote, [...] "So what new truths have we gleaned from Battlefield Earth? First, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> spirituality is a fine thing, but it's probably best to avoid joining denominations that make action movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Almendra was {{released}} on November 29, 1969 on Vik, a subsidiary of RCA Records. Some sources, however, place {{the release of the}} album in early 1970, time in which the band released a typewritten, photocopied flyer that said: [...] "Over the course of six months of intense work, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> what is transcendent is no longer owned by the author and belongs to everyone. That is why January 15 is an important date for us and for you: it is the release of our first long play to you." [...] "Muchacha (ojos de papel)", with [...] "Ana no duerme" [...] as its B-side, {{was released}} as the album's only single on January 20, 1970.|$|E
2500|$|.....your {{favorite}} doctrine, Socrates, {{that our}} learning is simply recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous {{time in which}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> which we now recollect. But this would be impossible unless our soul had been somewhere before existing in this form of man; here then is another proof of the soul's immortality.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} wake him who sleeps in the cave," [...] I {{answered}} enigmatically, as we departed rejoicing, for now <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the Kendah {{did not yet}} know {{of the death of}} the serpent.|$|R
60|$|Since <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{the huge}} iguanodons were kept as tame herds by their owners, and were simply walking meat-stores, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{conceived}} that man, {{even with his}} primitive weapons, had established his ascendancy upon the plateau. We were soon to discover {{that it was not}} so, and that he was still there upon tolerance.|$|R
2500|$|On January 28, 2009, the Liberals {{agreed to}} support the Conservative budget with an amendment, ending the {{possibility}} of the coalition, so Layton said [...] "Today <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> you can't trust Mr. Ignatieff to oppose Mr. Harper. If you oppose Mr. Harper and you want a new government, I urge you {{to support the}} NDP." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{want those}} troops {{to come home}} based upon not politics, not based upon economics, but instead based upon the {{conditions}} on the ground determined by the generals … But I also think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> our troops should not go off and try {{to fight a war}} of independence for another nation. Only the Afghanis can win Afghanistan’s independence from the Taliban.|$|E
2500|$|.....the {{generation}} that {{carried on the}} war has been set apart by its experience... in our youth our hearts were touched with fire. It was given to us to learn {{at the outset that}} life is a profound and passionate thing. While we are permitted to scorn nothing but indifference, and... above all, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that...</b> the one and only success which it is [...] to command is to bring to his work a mighty heart. — Oliver Wendell Holmes ...|$|E
30|$|We {{wanted to}} see whether the score could be used to predict ease of correction. From experience, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> an older child {{requires}} more casting and we agreed {{that it was important to}} incorporate a multiplier variable according to the age of the child into our final score. As all elements are made stiffer with age, it was helpful to multiply the combined elements by this factor.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Jewish {{youth in}} 1910 {{considered}} Brandeis as a hero, someone whom we admired and worked for. When <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> he <b>had</b> accepted {{to head the}} Zionist Federation in the United States, we, the Zionist pupils, were extremely enthusiastic. The fact {{that a man who}} symbolised the finer side of life in the USA was eager to share his destiny with his people; it was like a dream that became a reality".|$|R
60|$|There is no {{need for}} me to set down the fact that our small force {{was in a state of}} the {{greatest}} excitement. From no less than three sources <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the enemy was so near as to make capture seem certain, and our only hope of safety was to press forward at the best possible speed until arriving at Washington, where we were told the commodore had already arrived.|$|R

Before the day breathes—the exile of Israel; {{that they would}} be subjugated in exile until the day when rule of the peoples is ended. For <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Rabbi Yitsḥak said that the dominion of all peoples together over Israel would last one thousand years. There is no אוּמָה (ummah), people, that would not subjugate them. 'One day' corresponds to: But it shall be one day which shall be known to YHWH (Zechariah 14:7).|$|E
2500|$|... ust {{as in the}} {{sciences}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember {{that no one can}} predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the ancient}} poets <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the cities are feminine. So {{they were to}} poet Raggles; and his mind carried a {{concrete}} and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed.|$|E
5000|$|... "This is {{the lesson}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to <b>learn,</b> <b>that</b> {{of the two}} types of courage, that which {{consists}} in living is greater than that which aims at dying. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> sacrifice of one's life, though it may be a necessary means to an end, is not an end in itself. As a free people, we must choose the affirmative courage of life, not the negative sacrifice of death." [...] - Total War and the Human Mind, 1944.|$|R
60|$|I left Great Salt Lake a {{good deal}} {{confused}} as to what state of things existed there--and sometimes even questioning {{in my own mind}} whether a state of things existed there at all or not. But presently I remembered with a lightening sense of relief <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> two or three trivial things there which we could be certain of; and so the two days were not wholly lost. For instance, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were at last in a pioneer land, in absolute and tangible reality.|$|R
60|$|The Conwells {{came home}} from Europe the next summer, {{and we did not}} go again to Gormanville. But from time to time we heard of the Bentleys, and we heard to our great amaze that there was no change in the situation, as {{concerned}} Miss Bentley and Glendenning. I think that later it would have surprised us if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> there was a change. Their lives all seemed to have adjusted themselves to the conditions, and we who were mere spectators came at last to feel nothing abnormal in them.|$|R
6000|$|Symonds grows much on me: in many ways, {{what you}} would least expect, a very sound man, and very wise in a wise way. It is curious how F. and I always turn to him for advice: <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> his advice is good.--Yours ever, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, we don't," [...] said Anne, {{shaking her}} head gravely. [...] "We are getting very, very wise, and {{it is such a}} pity.

6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Koswell, Larkspur and Flockley {{were guilty}} of this plot against you, and that a man named Parwick aided them by getting a strange powder for them, the powder that made you dizzy and sick," [...] were Grace's words, and they filled the Rovers with much satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> all <b>that</b> our acquaintances {{among the}} command could tell us, Jacob insisted that Sergeant Corney see General Herkimer without delay, {{in order to}} <b>learn</b> if <b>that</b> officer would so far {{interest}} himself in the fate of Peter Sitz as to make inquiries of Thayendanega regarding him, in case the opportunity offered.|$|R
3000|$|The PREDICT {{project has}} evolved {{considerably}} since its conceptualization in 2006. During these seven years <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> many lessons <b>that</b> <b>had</b> {{an impact on}} this process: [...]...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> already <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the {{batteries}} fronting Fort Schuyler {{on the northeast}} had been abandoned, {{and it was only}} necessary to get a view of the remainder of the British encampment. There was little need to visit the Tory quarters, for, as it seemed to me, all those renegades were present, taking part in the orgy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Inkosazana, {{there has}} been {{dwelling}} with you one Noie, the daughter of Seyapi the wizard, who with all his house was slain at this place by order of the King. She also should have been slain, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> you called down lightning from Heaven, and that with it you slew the soldier who had run her down, slew him and burned him up, as you {{had the right to}} do, and took the girl to be your slave, as you had the right to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{counsel is}} good," [...] said the Duke of Athens, turning his shrewd wizened {{face to the}} King; [...] "but one thing only I would add to it. The {{strength}} of these people lies in their archers, and if we could throw them into disorder, were it only for a short time, we should win the hedge; else they will shoot so strongly that we must lose many men before we reach it, for indeed <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> no armor will keep out their shafts when they are close." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now. The {{whole thing}} has {{hardened}} too long. Her pride will never let her speak. We used to hope she would be tricked into it by forgetfulness or accident--we used to lay traps for her--but all to no effect. It is such a shame, too. They were made for each other. Do you know, I get cross when I begin to thrash the whole silly affair over like this. Doesn't {{it sound as if}} we were talking of the quarrel of two school-children? Of late years <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> it does not do to speak of Lucinda to Romney, even in the most commonplace way. He seems to resent it." ...|$|E

40|$|ONE of {{the most}} dreaded {{complications}} attendant upon intracardiac surgery is the occurrence of embolization to the cerebral circulation, with its associated high mortality and morbidity. We are presenting a method for reducing the incidence of such episodes which seems to offer a practical approach toward the solution of this problem. In a previous publication l we described the technic and presented {{a small number of}} cases in which it was used. The number of cases so handled is now 433, and {{it would seem that the}} figures are statistically sig-nificant. These cases are compared with 235 consecutive cases in which the same operation was performed prior to the adoption of specific protective measures against cerebral embolization, and the modified technic is described. While the original report of 80 cases stated that there had been no in-stance of cerebral embolization, our subsequent experience necessitates cor-rection of the implication that the technic described is infallible. From our previous experience <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> prevention is the only feasibl...|$|R
60|$|An {{anonymous}} {{article in}} the Quarterly Review, following the appearance of Emma in 1815, full of generous appreciation of the charm of the new writer, {{was the beginning of}} Jane Austen's fame; and it is only within a few years that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the friendly and discerning critic was Walter Scott. He continued to be her admirer until her early death; but these two, the greatest writers of fiction in their age, were never brought together. Both were home-loving people, and Miss Austen especially was averse to publicity and popularity. She died, quietly as she had lived, at Winchester, in 1817, and was buried in the cathedral. She was a bright, attractive little woman, whose sunny qualities are unconsciously reflected in all her books.|$|E
6000|$|As for Helena, Mr. Walters justly {{argues that}} Dickens has marked her for some {{important}} part in the ruin of Jasper. [...] "There was a slumbering gleam of fire in her intense dark eyes. Let whomsoever it most concerned look well to it." [...] Again, {{we have been told}} that Helena had high courage. She had told Jasper that she feared him [...] "in no circumstances whatever." [...] Again, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> in childhood she had dressed as a boy when she ran away from home; and she had the motives of protecting Rosa and her brother, Neville, from the machinations of Jasper, who needs watching, as he is trying to ruin Neville's already dilapidated character, and, by spying on him, to break down his nerve. Really, of course, Neville is quite safe. There is no corpus delicti, no carcase of the missing Edwin Drood.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Dick, no one knows, or {{has indeed}} the faintest idea, what prisoners Tippoo still {{has in his}} hands. We {{do not know how}} many have been murdered during the years Tippoo has reigned. Men who have escaped have, from time to time, brought down news of murders in the places where they had been confined, but they have known little of what has {{happened}} elsewhere. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> certainly fifty or sixty were put to death, at Seringapatam, before we advanced upon it the first time. We know, too, that some were murdered in the hill forts that we have captured. But how many remain alive, at the present time, we have not the slightest idea. Tippoo might hand over a dozen, and take a solemn oath that there was not one remaining; and though we might feel perfectly certain that he was lying, we should be in no position to prove it.|$|E

40|$|The more {{we learn}} about biology the more {{we find out that}} all creatures contain the same basic components. This is bad for {{biochemical}} systematics.
