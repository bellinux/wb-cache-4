25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} rupture {{assessment}} have been recently reported. The {{majority of these}} approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the <b>wall</b> <b>stress</b> distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions {{have been shown to}} correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter. It is also known that <b>wall</b> <b>stress</b> alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the <b>wall</b> <b>stress</b> exceeds the wall strength. In light of this, rupture assessment may be more accurate if both the patient-specific <b>wall</b> <b>stress</b> is coupled together with patient-specific wall strength. A non-invasive method of determining patient-dependent wall strength was recently reported, with more traditional approaches to strength determination via tensile testing performed by other researchers in the field. Some of the more recently proposed AAA rupture-risk assessment methods include: AAA wall stress; AAA expansion rate; degree of asymmetry; presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT); a rupture potential index (RPI); a finite element analysis rupture index (FEARI); biomechanical factors coupled with computer analysis; growth of ILT; geometrical parameters of the AAA; and also a method of determining AAA growth and rupture based on mathematical models.|$|E

40|$|Purpose:Recent {{experimental}} and theoretic {{studies show that}} large <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients characterize disturbed flow patterns associated with the location of myointimal hyperplasia, atheroma, or both. Graft-to-artery anastomoses that minimize <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients may reduce the degree of myointimal development and the propensity for thrombosis. This study analyzes the distribution of distal anastomotic <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients for conventional geometries and for the optimized geometry assuming idealized merging of the graft with the artery. Methods:A validated computational fluid dynamics program was used to solve the transient three-dimensional partial differential equations and auxiliary equations that describe laminar incompressible blood flow. Time-averaged <b>wall</b> shear <b>stresses</b> and <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients were calculated for three distal graft-artery anastomoses: a standard end-to-side, a Taylor patch, and an optimized geometry. The latter was obtained iteratively by minimizing the local <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients and was analyzed under resting and exercise inflow waveforms. Results:Both the standard and Taylor patch anastomoses have relatively high <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients in the regions of the toe and heel. For all flow inputs studied nonuniform hemodynamics in the optimized graft design are largely eliminated, and the time-averaged <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients are greatly reduced throughout the anastomotic zone. At resting flow the Taylor patch produces slightly lower <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients in the anastomotic region than the standard end-to-side anastomosis. The optimized design reduces <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients to almost one half of that of the standard and Taylor patch geometries. At exercise flow <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients almost triple in the standard anastomosis and increase approximately 30 % in the Taylor patch. In contrast, the geometrically optimized design is basically independent {{of the type of}} flow input waveform in terms of time-averaged <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients and disturbed flow patterns. Conclusion:This study demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} design a terminal graft geometry for an end-to-side anastomosis that significantly reduces <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients. If the <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradient is confirmed to be a major hemodynamic determinant of intimal hyperplasia and restenosis, these results may point to the design of optimal bypass graft geometries...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Wall</b> shear <b>stress,</b> a local {{risk factor}} of atherosclerosis, is {{decreased}} {{in the common}} carotid artery of patients with vascular risk factors. We evaluated <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> in the common carotid artery of patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). As blood viscosity is a determinant of <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress,</b> we further investigated the impact of rheologic variables on <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> in relation to vascular risk factors and intima-media thickness. METHODS: High-resolution ultrasonography scans were used to study intima-media thickness, internal diameter, and blood velocity in the common carotid artery of 31 patients with PAD, 36 patients with AAA, and 37 controls. Furthermore, major hemorheologic variables and vascular risk factors were evaluated, and <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> was calculated. RESULTS: <b>Wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> was lower in patients with PAD (median [IQR], dynes/cm(2) : 14. 4 [10 to 19]) and with AAA (12. 1 [9 to 15]) than in healthy controls (20. 6 [17 to 24]; P <. 0001). <b>Wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> was inversely related to red cell aggregation (P =. 01), fibrinogen (P =. 003), leucocyte count (P =. 001), plasma viscosity (P =. 04), and intima-media thickness (P <. 0001). Furthermore, <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> was negatively associated with age, smoking, and triglycerides, but positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P <. 001).

40|$|Purpose: Restenosis due to distal anastomotic intimal hyperplasia, {{a leading}} cause of {{arterial}} bypass graft failure, is thought to be promoted by hemodynamic e#ects, specifically `abnormal' <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> patterns. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the e#ects of flow waveform on peri-anastomotic flow and <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> patterns. Methods: Blood flow and <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> patterns were numerically computed in a representative three-dimensional anastomosis using femoral, iliac and coronary flow waveforms suitable for humans at rest. Numerical results were validated against experimental data. Results: Peri-anastomotic <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> patterns were influenced by a complex interplay between secondary flow e#ects and unsteadiness. Peripheral flow waveforms (iliac, femoral) produced large temporal and spatial <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients on the host artery bed. In comparison, the coronary flow waveform produced normalized bed <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradients that were a factor of 2 [...] - 3 less than for the peripheral waveforms, even though average bed <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> magnitudes were similar for the two waveforms. Conclusions: If anastomotic intimal hyperplasia is promoted by large spatial and/or temporal gradients of <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress,</b> as has been proposed, this study predicts that there will be markedly less intimal hyperplasia on the host artery bed of coronary bypass grafts than for peripheral bypass grafts. This information, in conjunction with a comparative histopathologic study of intimal hyperplasia distribution, could help determine specific <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> factors promoting intimal hyperplasia. # 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamics {{is often}} {{recognized}} as one of the major factors in aneurysm rupture. Flow impingement, greater pressure, and abnormal <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> are all indications for aneurysm rupture. Characterizing <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> for intracranial aneurysms at similar anatomic locations may help in understanding its role. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six intracranial aneurysms at the paraclinoid and superclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery from 25 patients between July 2006 and July 2007 were studied retrospectively. Among them, 8 aneurysms were ruptured and 18 were unruptured. Compu-tational fluid dynamics was used to determine the wall shear distribution. Morphologic and hemody-namic variables was analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. RESULTS: <b>Wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> was qualitatively the same throughout the cardiac cycle; thus, only <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> at the end of diastole was compared. Both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms have similar maximal <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> (26 versus 23 N/m 2), and mean <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> is shown to be a function of the aneurysm area.

40|$|SUMMARY: Increasing {{detection}} of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, catastrophic outcomes from subarachnoid hemorrhage, and risks {{and cost of}} treatment necessitate defining objective predictive parameters of aneurysm rupture risk. Image-based computational fluid dynamics models have suggested associations between hemodynamics and intracranial aneurysm rupture, albeit with conflicting findings regarding <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress.</b> We propose that the “high-versus-low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> ” controversy is {{a manifestation of the}} complexity of aneurysm pathophysiology, and both high and low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> can drive intracranial aneurysm growth and rupture. Low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> and high oscillatory shear index trigger an inflammatory-cell-mediated pathway, which could be associated with the growth and rupture of large, atherosclerotic aneurysm phenotypes, while high <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> combined with a positive <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> gradient trigger a mural-cell-mediated pathway, which could be associated with the growth and rupture of small or secondary bleb aneurysm phenotypes.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} sequential and prolonged exposure to high and low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> on arterial remodeling using a rabbit arteriovenous fistula (AVF) model. Blood flow was increased by approximately 17 -fold to 20 -fold when the AVF was open, and returned to normal when the AVF was occluded. Repeated opening and closing of the AVF resulted in sequential exposure of the artery to high and low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress.</b> High flow and high <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> induced arterial dilatation, elongation, and tortuosity, without intimal thickening. The common carotid artery was elongated 37 % after 4 weeks of high flow, and was shortened 10 % after 6 weeks of normal flow. Subsequent cycles of high flow induced less elongation, with less shortening after return to normal flow. Enlargement of the distal segment was more dramatic than in the proximal segment, despite exposure to the same volume of flow and the same initial high <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> after creation of the AVF. The distal carotid segment enlarged more than did the proximal segment during each exposure to high flow. In segments of carotid artery exposed to low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> (< 5 dynes/cm 2) intimal thickening developed. These changes were maximal in the distal carotid segment, just before the AVF. Each cycle of low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> induced intimal thickening accompanied by medial hyperplasia. Intimal thickening was inhibited during periods of high flow when <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> was high. Three cycles of flow alteration induced three layers of intimal thickening in the distal arterial segment, two layers of intimal thickening in the middle segment, and one layer of intimal thickening in the proximal segment. Long-term exposure to low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> induced severe intimal thickening and medial hyperplasia in different segments. Thus {{the response of the}} carotid artery afferent to an AVF varies {{along the length of the}} artery, with maximum enlargement, elongation, and tortuosity in the distal segment, just proximal to the AVF. Similarly, intimal thickening in response to low <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> is maximal in the distal carotid artery.

Abdominal aortas from 10 young adults with no signs of atherosclerotic disease were obtained during autopsy. Methods:Quantitative <b>wall</b> shear <b>stresses</b> were measured at rest and exercise in one suprarenal and two infrarenal positions using laser Doppler anemometry. Intimal thickening indices were measured blindedly at the corresponding locations using histomorphometric methods, and compared to <b>wall</b> shear <b>stress</b> variables using linear regression analysis. Results:Intimal thickness index increased significantly with age. Intimal thickness index was significantly lower in the suprarenal than the infrarenal aorta, and higher at the distal posterior vessel wall compared to the anterior wall. Intimal thickness index correlated significantly with mean, minimum and oscillating <b>wall</b> shear <b>stresses</b> measured at rest. Conclusion:Intimal thickness in the undiseased abdominal aorta correlated significantly with mean, minimum and oscillating <b>wall</b> shear <b>stresses</b> at rest measured in a pulsatile flow model. No correlations were found with maximum shear stress parameters. Exercise changed the local <b>wall</b> shear <b>stresses</b> away from the characteristics associated with intimal thickness index...|$|R
