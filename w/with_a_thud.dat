25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Chicago {{increased}} its lead with Gould nailing a 41-yard field {{goal for the}} only score of the period. However, in the fourth quarter, New York took the lead with QB Eli Manning completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer, along with RB Reuben Droughns. The Bears did have one final attempt, but it ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment we heard the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> Both were tile roofs.|$|E
2500|$|The old plan of a [...] "drop" [...] was {{discarded}} {{for a more}} merciful machine, {{by which}} the prisoner is jerked up from a platform on the ground level by a weight of 280 lbs, which is suspended by an independent rope pending the execution â€¦ At the words [...] "Forgive us our trespasses," [...] the executioner drove his chisel against the light rope that held the ponderous iron {{at the other end}} of the noose, and in an instant the heavy weight fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud,</b> and the [...] body was jerked into the air and hung dangling between the rough posts of the scaffold.|$|E
50|$|He {{was already}} a fast {{freestyle}} swimmer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thudding</b> kick {{when he went to}} Xalapa to study law and to be coached in swimming.|$|R
50|$|Lyle scored {{impressive}} {{victories over}} rated Jose Luis Garcia, and big names Oscar Bonavena and Earnie Shavers during his career. He also won a split decision over Joe Bugner, boring in <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thudding</b> body attack {{in a fine}} contest.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Spencer {{shut down}} the pantry window <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vicious <b>thud.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Each {{body was}} {{inspected}} {{by a physician}} to ensure that death had occurred. The bodies of the executed were allowed to hang for about 30 minutes and soldiers began to cut them down at 1:53 P.M. A corporal raced {{to the top of}} the gallows and cut down Atzerodt's body, which fell to the ground <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> He was reprimanded, and the other bodies were cut down more gently. Herold's body was next, followed by Powell's. Surratt's body was cut down at 1:58 P.M. As Surratt's body was cut loose, her head fell forward. A soldier joked, [...] "She makes a good bow" [...] and was rebuked by an officer for his poor use of humor.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{national}} publications speculated on Portman {{becoming the}} vice presidential nominee soon after Romney became the presumptive nominee. In [...] "Why Rob Portman Will Be Romney's Vice Presidential Nominee," [...] an article in The Atlantic, acclaimed syndicated journalist Major Garrett authored [...] "In the frenzied environment that will accompany the prelude to Romney's pick, the Portman choice may land <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> on the charisma meter, but it won't {{set in motion a}} wave of [...] "guess what" [...] stories and will allow Romney to focus on the campaign, not thorny revelations that must be ritualistically turned into an us-against-them media meme. In fact, Portman might actually talk Boston out of its hypertensive and allergic reactions to reporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Operating in the {{supposedly}} inviolable {{waters of the}} Sea of Japan, the wolf pack attacked shipping and made exploratory attempts to enter Japanese harbors. Late on 9 June, Tunny attacked a cargo vessel. One torpedo hit the enemy vessel <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> but failed to explode, and Tunny discontinued the attack. In the harbor entering phase of the patrol, Tunny closed the breakwater of Etomo Ko to 8,000yards (7.3km) shortly before midnight on 12 June. Town and waterfront lights provided illumination, but no suitable target could be found, and the submarine cleared the harbor before midnight. A few minutes later, Tunny approached within [...] of the harbor mouth at Uppuri Wan but discreetly withdrew when searchlights located and then brilliantly illuminated the intruder.|$|E
60|$|Frank Crosse {{took the}} book and dropped it. It fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sulky <b>thud</b> upon the floor.|$|R
60|$|A seal-skin case came <b>with</b> <b>a</b> soft <b>thud</b> {{on to the}} floor. Ida opened it. It was full.|$|R
60|$|He {{was just}} feeling for his matches to relight it when Wyatt dropped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>thud</b> into his {{favourite}} herbaceous border.|$|R
2500|$|A {{light rain}} was falling and {{visibility}} was poor when, {{half an hour}} before morning twilight, Tunny began a radar approach. Rapidly shoaling water less than 20fathoms (37m) deep and land masses on two sides of the submarine limited her maneuverability. At , the extreme phosphorescence of the water illuminated her wake and betrayed her presence to the enemy ship, which began signaling the unidentified intruder with a blinker light. Despite her detection, Tunny continued the approach until she was only [...] from the target and then launched three torpedoes. The Japanese ship, now discernible as a loaded tanker, began to maneuver radically and opened fire on the submarine. Undeterred, Tunny submerged and continued the attack, firing a second volley from her stern tubes. One of these torpedoes hit the side of the tanker <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud,</b> but without explosion, and a small column of water erupted just forward of the tanker's bridge. Duds and prematures were a problem for American submarines early in 1943, and verification that this torpedo had indeed hit the tanker, but failed to detonate, was forthcoming when members of the tanker's crew dashed to the spot in question and began examining the impact area with flashlights. Despite continuous fire from the ship and the proximity of land, Tunny managed to stay within firing range of her target by traveling at full speed. After the tanker successfully evaded Tunnys third salvo, the submarine fired a last torpedo from [...] as the intended victim reached the passage into Hong Kong. Following this disappointing conclusion to her attack, Tunny dove in anticipation of search planes which appeared within two hours and continued their surveillance throughout the day.|$|E
60|$|Clark's eyes shot fire, and {{he brought}} down the stock of his rifle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E

60|$|Jimmy did so {{and then}} uttered an exclamation as {{he dropped the}} object he took out. It was dark-colored, and fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dull <b>thud.</b>|$|R
60|$|Paolo {{withdrew a}} few paces, then Hector gave another pull. The rope gave way at once. He {{flattened}} {{himself against the}} house, and the hook fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dull <b>thud</b> <b>a</b> foot or two away.|$|R
60|$|As I rode past an orchard, an apple, {{loosened}} by the rainstorm, {{came down}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E
60|$|The snowball was {{launched}} forth with swiftness and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> struck the spot {{directly in the}} center.|$|E
60|$|No one answered. But a heavy {{piece of}} the adobe wall fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> Duane heard it crack, felt it shake.|$|E
60|$|Hans was {{not allowed}} to speak until he was out of hearing {{distance}} of the camp. Then he was dumped on the ground <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dull <b>thud.</b>|$|R
60|$|The preacher fell to {{the ground}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dull <b>thud.</b> He could ill afford to lose ten dollars. He was hastily removed and a cheaper one secured.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{he brought}} his tilted chair down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sharp <b>thud.</b> Gabe Foley had paused in his {{manipulation}} of a king to hurl a question at the Greenvale men.|$|R
60|$|The weak-kneed wastrel let {{fall the}} box <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> upon the floor. Mrs. Postwhistle looked her new {{assistant}} up and down.|$|E
6000|$|Vane {{brought his}} paddle down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> [...] "'Just for to-night, to the Old Country,'" [...] he hummed, and added: [...] "It sticks to one." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} the knife fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud,</b> and a {{bleeding}} head rolled into the basket, the eyes still staring, but powerless now to inspire terror.|$|E
60|$|As we watched, {{clinging}} {{to each other}} terrified, {{the first of these}} waves struck our hill, causing the mighty mass of solid rock to quiver like a yacht beneath the impact of an ocean roller, or an aspen in a sudden rush of wind. It struck and slowly separated, then <b>with</b> <b>a</b> majestic motion flowed like water {{over the edge of the}} precipice on either side, and fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thudding</b> sound into the unmeasured depths beneath. And this was but a little thing, a mere forerunner, for after it, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slow, serpentine movement, rolled the body of the avalanche.|$|R
60|$|His {{companion}} poised {{himself for}} a moment, and then, lashing out with his left hand, came home <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy <b>thud</b> on the place indicated. Dimsdale smiled gently and shook his head.|$|R
60|$|His {{fall was}} a short one, and he brought up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> painful <b>thud</b> {{at the bottom of}} a deer pit--a covered trap which the natives dig to catch their fleet-footed prey.|$|R

6000|$|... "But I will," [...] {{retorted}} Dick, {{and struck}} out once more. This time his fist landed on the bully's left eye, and once again Baxter went down, this time <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet!" [...] cried a {{youthful}} voice behind Stillwater, and crash! down came a heavy stick, hitting the gambler squarely upon {{the head and}} sending him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> to the earth.|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} {{one of the}} men brought his fist down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dull <b>thud</b> upon the other's half-concealed face, and a little spark of scornful anger crept into the girl's eyes.|$|R
60|$|Before we had {{a moment}} to speak, much less form a plan of attack, the lion rose, spat at us defiantly, and {{deliberately}} jumped off the crag. We heard him strike <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frightful <b>thud.</b>|$|R
60|$|Nan set {{the glass}} down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decided <b>thud.</b> John's curtness displeased her. He needn't suppose {{that it made}} any {{difference}} to her if he took it into his stupid head to go to Afghanistan.|$|R
