5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl Dönitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer if he would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> information on the effects of the air war. Speer agreed, and over the next several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E
5|$|When a large Ottoman force {{threatened}} the fortress, Kružić appealed to Ferdinand for help, but the Emperor's attention was diverted by an Ottoman attack in Slavonia. Kružić led {{the defense of}} Klis, and with his soldiers fought almost alone against the Ottomans, as they repeatedly hurled armies against the fortress. No troops from the Hungarian king arrived, as they were slaughtered by the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, and the Venetians baulked at sending any help. Only the pope was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> some men and money.|$|E
5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. The {{first step was}} to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|When a large Turkish force {{threatened}} the fortress, Kružić appealed to Ferdinand I for help, but the Emperor's attention was diverted by a Turkish invasion into Slavonia. For {{more than two}} and half decades, Captain Kružić, also called (Prince of Klis), defended the fortress against the Turkish invasion. Kružić led the defense of Klis, and with his soldiers fought almost alone against the Ottomans, as they hurled army after army against the fortress. No troops would come from the Hungarian king, as they were defeated by the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, and the Venetians baulked at sending any help. Only the popes were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> some men and money.|$|E
5|$|Groves made {{critical}} {{decisions on}} prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation and acquiring raw materials {{needed by the}} scientists and engineers. By the time he assumed command of the project, {{it was evident that}} the AA-3 priority rating that Marshall had obtained was insufficient. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an AAA rating on request for critical materials to remove bottlenecks. Groves went to Donald M. Nelson, the chairman of the War Production Board and, after threatening to take the matter to the President, obtained a AAA priority for the Manhattan project. It was agreed that the AA-3 priority would still be used where possible.|$|E
5|$|On 3February, {{the head}} of the State Emergency Service (SES) and then-Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen toured {{northern}} Queensland to inspect damage. The government of Australia vowed to assist by providing financial and emergency services, also offering to provide aid to banana and sugar cane farmers who suffered losses as a result of Winifred. Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food. Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before raising loans, and also stated that the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided that the federal government was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> financial assistance. Approximately 500volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, reinstating electrical and other essential services, evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700tarpaulins to shield roofless houses. Rescue and relief work was hindered by high traffic on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E
5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|In Tim Jorgenson's novel Kolossus, set in 1953, Hitler {{is portrayed}} as conniving to {{designate}} the next Pope, his favored candidate being a (fictive) American papal nuncio who is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> cover for a Nazi plot to steal an American atomic bomb.|$|E

25|$|In late 1939, both {{countries}} began discussions {{of creating a}} larger economic agreement than the 1939 German–Soviet Trade Agreement. From the start of those negotiations, the Soviet Union made {{clear that it was}} willing to exchange its strategic maritime position for technology. The Soviets were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a northern base to the Germans, but not a busy seaport because it would provide an open indication of Soviet assistance of Germany, indicating that it was a co-belligerent.|$|E
25|$|The G20's {{transparency}} and accountability have been questioned by critics, who {{call attention to the}} absence of a formal charter {{and the fact that the}} most important G20 meetings are closed-door. In 2001, the economist Frances Stewart proposed an Economic Security Council within the United Nations as an alternative to the G20. In such a council, members would be elected by the General Assembly based on their importance to the world economy, and the contribution they are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> to world economic development.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{unstable}} {{state of affairs}} in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard {{to try to find}} evidence of treason in Boston. Parliament had determined that the Treason Act 1543 was still in force, which would allow Bostonians to be transported to England to stand trial for treason. Bernard could find no one who was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials. The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.|$|E
25|$|Locally in Rogaland {{there was}} a mix of positions. Twenty-three {{municipalities}} in Rogaland, Hordaland and Vest-Agder supported the initiative from NLA and awarded funding. Rogaland County Municipality, then the operator of Rogaland Central Hospital, had no objections {{to the establishment of}} the base, but were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> funding. Many physicians at the hospital opposed the establishment. Their main concern was that it would drain human resources which could be better used at the emergency department. To fund the establishment, NLA largely approached private companies and asked for charitable donations.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, Coulson – {{while under}} oath {{as a witness}} in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan – denied any {{knowledge}} of phone hacking at the News of the World or that he knew the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The following day, the Crown Prosecution Service said that it had determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge Coulson over allegations that {{he was aware of}} phone hacking at the publication. The CPS said that witnesses interviewed by the Metropolitan Police – including those who had previously made allegations through media outlets – had not been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> admissible evidence.|$|E

Richard Aboulafia, Teal Group vice president of analysis, and a long-time critic of the CSeries, indicated that the cancellation of the program and coverage of losses by the Government of Canada were both likely. Bombardier stated that it was fully committed to the CSeries and had the financial resources in place to support the program.|$|E
25|$|At {{first there}} was some {{question}} as to what exactly the new company should do.

25|$|The borough (now city) of Easton in the mid-1700s {{and early}} 1800s {{did not see}} much success in {{building}} a sound educational system. Easton built its first school in 1755, and though seeing some classes of students graduate, the school closed in 1798. In 1784, there was a desire to build an academy for young students called the Easton Union Academy. Though it was chartered in 1794 by the Trustees of the Union Academy, the school was unable to grow. The academy struggled with infrastructural upkeep and maintaining a cohort of teachers <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> instruction to students. In 1824, the academy closed and the School Board of Easton took over the property.|$|E
