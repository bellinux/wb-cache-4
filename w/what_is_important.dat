5|$|The French {{zoologist}} Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{showed in}} 1818 in his theorie d'analogue ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier's embranchements, such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate. Geoffroy stated {{the principle of}} connections, namely that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> is the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

25|$|Ecological {{economics}} generally {{rejects the}} view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity - or natural capital and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically.

Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences {{as a means to}} address this.|$|E

25|$|To {{a certain}} degree it is normal to procrastinate {{and it can be}} {{regarded}} as a useful way to identify <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people). On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, stress, anxiety, sense of guilt and crisis as well as loss of personal productivity and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination gets almost chronic. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also social stigma and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of willpower or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying psychological disorder, but not necessarily.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger’s work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make sense of their feelings by seeing “them as embodying a judgment about the object they bear on: ‘To experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating” (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are “affective modes of awareness” (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream cognitive approaches which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a linear mode of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don’t necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the world around him, they also show <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor’s theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that this is where it rightfully belongs.|$|E

[...] The song also contains influences of disco, opening with a [...] "summer-y disco guitar" [...] before moving into [...] "hands-in-the-air synth blasts" [...] as a critic for Vice magazine described.

500|$|Expressing honestly, in NVC, {{is likely}} to involve expressing an {{observation}}, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if {{the context of the}} conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, [...] "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation about what you want from them and why." ...|$|E
500|$|The poem {{served as}} a sort of {{opposite}} to the popular idea that The Waste Land {{served as a}}n expression of disillusionment after World [...] War I, even though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. World War II itself has a direct mention in only a few of Eliot's writings. However, World War II does affect the poem, especially with the disruption caused by the war being reflected within the poem as a disruption of nature and heaven. The poem describes society in ways similar to The Waste Land, especially with its emphasis on death and dying. The place is connected to where Eliot's family originates, and, as such, is also the place where his family will symbolically end. In {{the second part of the}} poem, nature is experiencing disorder, and it is suggested that humans too may burn, and also that reason, knowledge, and science cannot save people. The errors of our past become the reasons for war and conflict and we need to become humble in order to escape the destruction. However, darkness consumes the rulers of the world and society. This is, in part, due to Adam's fall, and the resulting concept of original sin. Christ is our savior and we need to seek redemption to overcome our human failings. Eliot states that he has been involved with fighting for humanity and trying to help mankind learn <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important.</b> Only through Christ is man able to be redeemed.|$|E
