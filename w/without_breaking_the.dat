5|$|The {{mathematics}} of topology {{has inspired}} several artists in modern times. The sculptor John Robinson (1935–2007) created {{works such as}} Gordian Knot and Bands of Friendship, displaying knot theory in polished bronze. Other works by Robinson explore the topology of toruses. Genesis is based on Borromean rings – a set of three circles, no two of which link but in which the whole structure cannot be taken apart <b>without</b> <b>breaking.</b> <b>The</b> sculptor Helaman Ferguson creates complex surfaces and other topological objects. His works are visual representations of mathematical objects; The Eightfold Way {{is based on the}} projective special linear group PSL(2,7), a finite group of 168 elements. The sculptor Bathsheba Grossman similarly bases her work on mathematical structures.|$|E
5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic Picture Transmission based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to hold back the waters <b>without</b> <b>breaking.</b> <b>The</b> hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E

25|$|Retailers in Canada may refuse bank notes <b>without</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> law. According {{to legal}} guidelines, {{the method of}} payment has to be {{mutually}} agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, stores may refuse $100 bank notes if they feel that would put them {{at risk of being}} counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species may}} show {{morphological}} adaptations, {{such as a}} flat head and an upturned mouth, {{that allow them to}} perform ASR <b>without</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> water surface (which would make them more visible to aerial predators). One example is the mummichog, whose upturned mouth suggests surface feeding, but whose feeding habits are not particularly restricted to the surface. In the tambaqui, a South American species, exposure to hypoxia induces within hours the development of additional blood vessels inside the lower lip, enhancing its ability to take up oxygen during ASR. Swimming upside down may also help fishes perform ASR, as in some upside-down catfish.|$|E
25|$|For {{portions}} of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, {{it is recommended that}} the luma samples be assigned the code word 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0mV. It is permissible to encode analog vertical interval information (such as vertical interval timecode or vertical interval test signals) <b>without</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended—and neither is necessary in the digital interface.|$|E

25|$|Spiral binding is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself <b>without</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of the page and winding a wire helix (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of the crisis, al-Mu'tazz was {{concerned}} with portraying himself as the legitimate caliph. He had been proclaimed as heir-apparent during his father's lifetime, and according to the succession arrangements he should have become caliph after the death of al-Muntasir. When he had signed away his rights to the caliphate in 862, he had been under duress to do so, with the Turks threatening to kill him if he refused, and therefore he considered the deed of abdication to be void. He also sought to convince the people that they could switch their allegiance to him <b>without</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> oath they had taken to serve al-Musta'in, and went through the effort to explain in detail how this could be done in a letter to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah.|$|E

25|$|While battles at sea were rare, {{they would}} {{occasionally}} occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship {{could be easily}} boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles <b>without</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform {{in the heat of}} battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{materials}} at extreme conditions, high pressure and high temperature uses {{a wide array}} of techniques to achieve these conditions and probe the behavior of material while in the extreme environment. Percy Williams Bridgman, the great pioneer of high-pressure research {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, revolutionized the field of high pressures with his development of an opposed anvil device with small flat areas that were pressed one against the other with a lever-arm. The anvils were made of tungsten carbide (WC). This device could achieve pressure of a few gigapascals, and was used in electrical resistance and compressibility measurements. The principles of the DAC are similar to the Bridgman anvils but in order to achieve the highest possible pressures <b>without</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> anvils, they were made of the hardest known material: a single crystal diamond. The first prototypes were limited in their pressure range and there was not a reliable way to calibrate the pressure.|$|E
