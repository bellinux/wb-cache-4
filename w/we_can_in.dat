[...] He did, however, privately attack the president over his Embargo Act, {{despite the fact that}} it was voted for by his son John Quincy, a U.S. senator. Another incident began in relation to Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his [...] "partiality for monarchy" [...] and [...] "pride of talents and much ambition." [...] A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, the friendship healed.|$|E

[...] "The US is in touch with the Government of India to discuss ways that we can provide any assistance at this difficult time. Certainly, India is a very developed government with its own domestic services or capabilities to provide emergency assistance. That said, it’s something we normally do especially in the cases of strong partners like India, where we offer whatever assistance <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of natural disasters." [...] He advised US citizens to divert all travel to the affected areas, while those in the region were advised to shelter in place and monitor updates from the US consulate general.|$|E

2500|$|Since 31 August 2009, {{legislation}} granting lesbians equal birth {{rights in}} England and Wales came into effect, meaning both {{can now be}} named on a child's birth certificate, amending the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987. The legislation was criticised by those who believe it was [...] "damaging the traditional notion of a family". Stonewall Head of Policy and Research Ruth Hunt said the new law makes life easier for lesbian families and stated [...] "Now lesbian couples in the UK who make a considered decision to start a loving family will finally be afforded equal access to services they help fund as taxpayers". Home Office minister, Lord Brett was full of praise in his comments: This positive change means that, for the first time, female couples who have a child using fertility treatment {{have the same rights}} as their heterosexual counterparts to be shown as parents in the birth registration. It is vital that we afford equality wherever <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> society, especially as family circumstances continue to change. This is an important step forward in that process.
