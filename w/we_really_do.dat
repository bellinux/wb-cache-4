500|$|When the Pam {{character}} discusses her impressive volleyball ability, {{she says}} she played volleyball in junior high, senior high, college and went to volleyball camps most summers. However, in the episode [...] "Job Fair", she said her high school gym brings back memories of her faking PMS {{to get out of}} playing basketball and volleyball. Writer Jen Celotta acknowledged this was a continuity error: [...] "Yeah, we screwed up. I didn't remember that she said that, specifically about volleyball. And <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> try to be careful about those things." ...|$|E
500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to Beyoncé's proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they live in our world. And that's what the song is about. And it felt like we had to take it there to make it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts Beyoncé preparing plastic surgery, consuming diet pills and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, Beyoncé decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring Beyoncé drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E

60|$|I suppose <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} what fear is. I inquired {{the name of the}} {{garrison}} of the fortress of Malabat, and they said it was Mehemet Ali Ben Sancom.

That was evidence which one could not well refute. There is nothing like reputation.|$|E

Do you think that she would come and see me, or let me come and see her? <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> want to {{understand}} these things, {{and it seems to}} me, somehow, that people like Julia Thurnbrein, and all those who really understand, keep away from us wilfully.

[...] Why, the fellow is all O! That accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains {{why there is}} neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn't an O in it.

2500|$|Driven by an unswerving {{belief in}} his abilities, Romário's laid back manner and {{overwhelming}} self-confidence would be displayed throughout his career, with Guus Hiddink, his coach at PSV, stating, “If {{he saw that}} I was a bit more nervous than usual ahead of a big game, he’d {{come to me and}} say: ‘Take it easy, coach, I’m going to score and we’re going to win'.

6000|$|... "We {{have none}} of us the least idea what will be required," [...] she said. [...] "It will be far better to pay {{somewhat}} higher prices for what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> want out there than to cumber ourselves {{with all sorts of}} things that may be useless to us. We have already a considerable amount of baggage. There are our clothes, linen, and books, your father's two double-barrelled guns, which, by the way, I do not think he has ever used since we have been married. The only thing we had better get, as far as I see, will be four rifles, which no doubt we can buy cheap second-hand, and four revolvers.|$|E
6000|$|To begin with: we do {{not always}} know whether what we are {{experiencing}} is a sensation or an image. The things we see in dreams when our eyes are shut must count as images, yet while we are dreaming they seem like sensations. Hallucinations often begin as persistent images, and only gradually acquire that influence over belief that makes the patient regard them as sensations. When we are listening for a faint sound--the striking of a distant clock, or a horse's hoofs on the road--we think we hear it many times before <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do,</b> because expectation brings us the image, and we mistake it for sensation. The distinction between images and sensations is, therefore, by no means always obvious to inspection.* ...|$|E

[...] "Anyway, I daresay {{that if your}} Grandma and I both got down to what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> mean, under our {{different}} ways of expressing it, we'd find out we both meant much the same thing. You'd better go by her way of expressing it, since it's {{been the result of}} experience. We'll have to wait until we see how the twins do turn out before we can be sure that my way is equally good." [...] After lunch they went back to the garden, where Paul made the acquaintance of the echoes, to his wonder and delight, while Anne and Miss Lavendar sat on the stone bench under the poplar and talked.|$|E
5000|$|Moskovitz {{is played}} in the film The Social Network by actor Joseph Mazzello. Responding to a {{question}} on Quora, Moskovitz said that the film [...] "emphasizes things that didn't matter (like the Winklevoss brothers, whom I've still never even met and had no part in the work we did to create the site over the past 6 years) and leaves out things that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> (like the many other people in our lives at the time, who supported us in innumerable ways)." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} much hope that {{anything}} would come of it, so we were surprised and delighted over the letter Max brought home from town four days later. It was a type-written screed from Halifax stating that the writer had for sale a white Persian cat answering to our description. The price was a hundred and ten dollars, and, if M.

5000|$|Before {{the episode}} aired, John Lithgow told the press, [...] "We end it in {{a blaze of}} glory. It was 139 episodes, {{laughing}} all the way. I must say the feeling is melancholy; <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> love it {{all the way up to}} the end. But in the final scene, the emotions from the actors (especially John Lithgow, Brian Hooks, Carl Anthony Payne II, French Stewart) were genuine as they really were upset about the series coming to a close. I am on to the next, and quite excited about my next big project." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{we should}} not wish our readers to think that Ram Spudd is always and only the contemplative poet of the softer aspects of nature. Oh, by no means. There are times when waves of passion sweep over him in such prodigious volume as to roll him to and fro like a pebble in the surf. Gusts of emotion blow over him with such {{violence}} as to hurl him pro and con with inconceivable fury. In such moods, {{if it were not}} for the relief offered by writing verse <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not know what would happen to him.

You can believe in Germany or fear her--whichever you like.

60|$|In {{accordance}} with commands of his, on March 2, 1682, the two valets, who had hitherto occupied one chamber at Exiles as at Pignerol, {{were cut off}} from all communication with each other. Says Saint-Mars, 'Since receiving your letter I have warded the pair as strictly and exactly as I did M. Fouquet and M. Lauzun, who cannot brag that he sent out or received any intelligence. Night and day two sentinels watch their tower; and my own windows command {{a view of the}} sentinels. Nobody speaks to my captives but myself, my lieutenant, their confessor, and the doctor, who lives eighteen miles away, and only sees them when I am present.' Years went by; on January 1687 one of the two captives died; <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not know which with absolute certainty. However, the intensified secrecy with which the survivor was now guarded seems more appropriate to Dauger; and M. Funck-Brentano and M. Lair have no doubt that it was La Riviere who expired. He was dropsical, that appears in the official correspondence, and the dead prisoner died of dropsy.|$|E
