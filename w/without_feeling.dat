5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons <b>without</b> <b>feeling</b> that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Galaxy Game and Computer Space, numerous other games have been directly inspired by Spacewar. These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO network computers), Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship. Products as late as the 1990 computer game Star Control drew direct inspiration from Spacewar. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games <b>without</b> <b>feeling</b> restricted to using Russell's own code or design.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} puzzles, Barth {{wanted to}} keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player {{to come to a}} solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the tutorials provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained baffled as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of the game from these tutorials such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution <b>without</b> <b>feeling</b> overwhelmed by the top players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard. He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments and discussions on the previous games.|$|E

25|$|According to Satoru Iwata, former {{president}} of Nintendo, turn-based RPGs have been unfairly criticized as being outdated, and action-based RPGs can frustrate players {{who are unable to}} keep up with the battles.

25|$|He {{writes that}} this third wave of {{antisemitism}} has {{in common with}} the first wave that Jews are able to be part of it. With religious antisemitism, Jews were able to distance themselves from Judaism, and Lewis writes that some even reached high rank within the church and the Inquisition. With racial antisemitism, this was not possible, but with the new, ideological, antisemitism, Jews are once again able to join the critics. The new antisemitism also allows non-Jews, he argues, to criticize or attack Jews <b>without</b> <b>feeling</b> overshadowed by the crimes of the Nazis.|$|E

25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations.

Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, <b>without</b> <b>feeling</b> like a victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E

25|$|Cantonese {{embroidery}} (Jyutping: Jyut6 sau3; Traditional Chinese: 粵繡) is the Cantonese {{style of}} embroidery, with considerable popularity in Lingnan {{and its own}} subculture.
