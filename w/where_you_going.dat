5000|$|The Soul Clan {{members were}} poorly served by Atlantic, which failed {{to invest in}} {{publicity}} and actively sabotaged their recording schedule. As Rob Whatman explains: [...] "Times were changing, {{and none of the}} final line-up of the Soul Clan were experimenting with, nor being encouraged to try, the new sounds of funk that might have boosted and elongated their hit careers. Atlantic Records was happy to let them fade away, while sucking up the back-catalogues and talents of regional hit factories such as Stax. No Marvin Gayes or Stevie Wonders would be nurtured in New York City." [...] Rob Whatman, [...] "The Soul Clan: <b>Where</b> <b>you</b> <b>going,</b> Joe?...", (May 13, 2006).|$|E

Babygirl that an interview with me, she was like, 'That music {{reminds me of a}} big hug. I could just play it from top to bottom.' There's a lot of albums you can't play from top to bottom anymore, you gotta go to your favorite song and go back and go forward. This record you could play from top to bottom.

5000|$|On January 8, 2014, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Urban Bridgez, J. Holiday spoke about the album title, saying: [...] "I named it Guilty Conscience because it’s basically like a movie. Let’s say, because I do what I do; I’m an R&B artist. So let’s {{say that if you}} could put a soundtrack to my life, in the last 5 years, this would be the soundtrack. So it’s kind of like, I’m telling my business. You know what I mean and I didn’t really want to. But it’s going to help when it comes to relationships like love and all of that because it’s like the sh*t really happens. The same way Steve Harvey did the book Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man. So it’s like the album, like I messed up with my main chick, trying to get with the side-chick. Like she was out there, but I didn’t know. So now I’m learning and I {{have to go back and}} fix my relationship because the side-chick got me all tore up. So for instance, like on the title track Guilty Conscience, that’s me talking to my main girl. And now I’m like, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>going,</b> what are you doing, why are you doing this, why are you putting on make-up? You know what I mean and that’s the guilty conscience and what it’s about." ...|$|E
