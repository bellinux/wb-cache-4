5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E

He learns that it belongs to Kioe Gie and Hap Nio, who have built up a vast farm, garden, and orchard that provide them with ample income. The two philanthropists are friends with the area's elite, and Hap Nio is happily married to a rich plantation administrator. When Kioe Gie and his companions return from playing tennis, they discover Kioe Lie hiding shamefully under a piano. Kioe Lie admits that he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> be greedy. When a police officer arrives, Kioe Lie confesses to poisoning Tam Bing, then runs outside and shoots himself.|$|E
5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E

5000|$|The Frege-Geach problem [...] - [...] {{named for}} Peter Geach, who {{developed}} {{it from the}} writings of Gottlob Frege [...] - [...] claims that by subscribing to Expressivism one necessarily accepts that the meaning of [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> tell lies" [...] {{is different from the}} meaning of the [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> tell lies" [...] part of the conditional [...] "If it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> tell lies, then it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> get your little brother to lie", and that therefore Expressivism is an inadequate explanation for moral language.|$|R

25|$|Maimonides, one of Judaism's most {{important}} theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why Jesus <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> create Christianity and why Muhammad <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> create Islam; he laments the pains Jews have suffered in persecution from followers {{of these new}} faiths as they attempted to supplant Judaism (in the case of Christianity, called Supersessionism). However, Maimonides {{then goes on to}} say that both faiths can be considered a positive part of God's plan to redeem the world.|$|E

25|$|Ervine appealed {{against the}} IMC's {{recommendation}} to newly appointed Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain {{on the basis}} that he could not be held directly responsible for the UVF's actions and thus it <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> penalise him personally.

25|$|The BBC {{fought to}} {{overturn}} a {{ruling by the}} Information Tribunal that the BBC <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> refuse to release {{to a member of}} the public under the Freedom of Information Act of 2000 (FOI) the Balen report on its Middle East coverage.

25|$|Helen Zille of the Democratic Alliance said Zuma contradicted {{his public}} message of safe sex to South Africans, {{among the worst}} sufferers of AIDS.

25|$|On September 14, Jean-Jacques Viseur (CDH), {{mayor of}} Charleroi, {{said that it}} <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> keep the socialists out of the government.

He said {{that as long as the}} PS is an opposition party, the MR will not make any concessions on state reform.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the Registrar, in {{reaching}} her decision, had relied on an allegation by J.C. Penney's lawyers that the applicant had been capitalizing on JC Penney's reputation and deceiving the public that her business was a branch of or associated in some way with JC Penney. However, the Court {{held that the}} Registrar <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> have done so as it was an inference which had no probative value since it was not founded on any substratum of facts.|$|E

50|$|The antiphilosopher {{could argue}} that, {{with regard to}} ethics, there is only practical, {{ordinary}} reasoning. Therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> a priori superimpose overarching ideas of {{what is good for}} philosophical reasons. For example, it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blanketly assume that only happiness matters, as in utilitarianism. This is not to say though that some utilitarian-like argument can’t be valid when it comes to what is right in some particular case.|$|R

25|$|Much {{paper has}} been {{consumed}} by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea. Huxley <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> pitch {{the loss of}} orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, {{and he did not}} estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.|$|E
25|$|Underlying Mr Barker's {{claim is}} that the Commonwealth Bank <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> dismiss him in breach of its policies. There are {{numerous}} difficulties facing an employee who believes they were wrongfully dismissed. At common law the employee {{had no right to}} be given a reason for the dismissal. If the employer dismissed an employee without notice, a court would scrutinise whether the employee's conduct justified summary dismissal. Even if the contract does not specify a period of notice, a term is implied that either party could bring the contract of employment to an end by giving a reasonable period of notice.|$|E

Hay Red Bell (born July 22, 1862 in Illinois; died November 16, 1917 in Missouri), a graduate of Moody Bible Institute. By November 1906 Wedge {{came to believe that}} it <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> fight except in self-defense, and that he should devote his life to Christian service. Other factors in his decision to retire were that he may have been the loser of several of his more recent bouts, and was also remorseful over the death of an opponent in San Francisco. and was encouraged to do so by Prudence Tracy.|$|E

Conversely, NME nominated the album for worst Album at the 2009 NME Awards, despite awarding it 8/10.|$|E
25|$|In 1799, Burr {{founded the}} Bank of the Manhattan Company. In later years, it was {{absorbed into the}} Chase Manhattan Bank, which in turn became part of JPMorgan Chase. In September 1799, Burr fought a duel with John Barker Church, whose wife, Angelica, was the sister of Hamilton's wife, Elizabeth. Church had alleged that Burr had taken a bribe from the Holland Company in {{exchange}} for using his political influence on its behalf. Burr and Church fired {{at each other and}} missed, and afterward Church acknowledged that he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> have accused Burr without having proof. Burr accepted this as an apology, and the two men shook hands and ended the dispute.|$|E
25|$|Hawkeye is {{challenged}} to a duel {{to the death}} by his former mentor Trick Shot. Hawkeye reluctantly accepts the challenge and wins. Trick Shot reveals that he is dying of cancer and wants to die honorably in battle. Hawkeye, instead of granting his former mentor’s wish, promises to fund his medical care. Later, when Crossfire places a bounty on Hawkeye’s right arm, Trick Shot (whose cancer had gone into remission) returns to aid his former pupil. Along with Mockingbird, the two archers defeat an army of supervillains looking to lay claim to the bounty. After this altercation with Crossfire, Hawkeye tells Mockingbird that he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blame her for {{what happened with the}} Phantom Rider. The pair soon reconcile. After being shot while confronting criminals, Hawkeye adopts an armoured version of his costume to battle the gangs of Los Angeles.|$|E
