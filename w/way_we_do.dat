25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
500|$|The ways {{in which}} the plant {{variation}} resulting from human activity is named and classified remains contentious. The replacement of the expression [...] "cultivated plant" [...] with the word [...] "cultigen" [...] is not universally accepted. The debate continues concerning the notions of ranks and taxa as applied to cultigens. Is it appropriate to call the highly modified transgenic products of human artificial selection [...] "taxa" [...] in the same <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> for the products of natural selection in the wild? To overcome this difficulty the term culton (pl. culta) has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about cultigens.|$|E

500|$|The SRVUSD opened both Dougherty and Live Oak Elementary School on August 25, 2007. Dougherty {{began its}} inaugural school year on August 27, 2007, {{becoming}} the first high school in 34 years {{to open in the}} SRVUSD. History teacher James Corcoran noted that working at the first year school was an opportunity to develop its community, saying [...] "You oftentimes will go into a school as a teacher, or even a principal, and it's 'This is the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it around here.' It's hard to change that once it's been set." [...] Elaine O'Hanlon, founding president of the Dougherty Parent-Teacher Association, said that parent volunteering would be encouraged at the new school.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".|$|E
500|$|Marvel Comics {{editor-in-chief}} Joe Quesada felt dissolving the Peter Parker and Mary Jane {{marriage and}} returning Spider-Man to his roots {{was necessary to}} preserve the longevity of the character for the next 20 or 30 years. Quesada said he and other previous editors-in-chief had long been seeking an opportunity to begin a new methodology in which to tell Spider-Man stories, but had not found a reasonable way to do so. Quesada said, [...] "It's very easy to un-marry a character, or fix something like that: you just do a huge universal retcon, and say a few events in history didn't happen. But that's really not the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it here at Marvel." [...] Quesada found an opportunity to address this in {{the events of the}} 2007 Civil War mini-series, which resulted in the unmasking of Spider-Man's identity to the public. Quesada knew J. Michael Straczynski was planning to end his run as a Marvel writer, so he personally approached Straczynski to propose [...] "One More Day" [...] as his final project.|$|E

500|$|Despite this assessment, {{the end of}} the show's {{fourth season}} saw Hahn grow closer to {{orthopedic}} surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. [...] We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{the press}} the horse {{received}} {{was viewed as}} giving a needed boost to the sport. Jockey and sports analyst Gary Stevens noted prior to the Belmont, [...] "I haven't heard Thoroughbred horse racing mentioned on CNN for a long time, and it was {{right at the top}} of the hour... He's brought us mainstream again for the first time in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We have always said Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> about him." [...] In announcing the Moment of the Year, Keith Chamblin of NTRA stated, [...] "the fans reminded us that nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse." [...] When the horse won the 2016 Vox Populi award, Perry Martin said, [...] "I'm proud to witness the love and devotion of Chrome's fans. They've always seen what I've seen in him." ...|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Electronic {{music is}} another influence. Parker has used rock {{instrumentation}} in an electronic manner, saying [...] "The <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> music, it's organic, but it's {{meant to be}} quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost {{in a kind of}} electronic nature. Using our playing as though it was a living sample." [...] A heavy feature on Innerspeaker is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a synth. Parker mentioned this by saying [...] "I had a few obsessions when recording Innerspeaker. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound." ...|$|E

I learned to cut loose the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> live and not to be afraid to break something or whatever." [...] While capturing the essence of At the Drive-In's live shows in a way never before seen, the record also featured some of the band's most experimental songs, including [...] "Rolodex Propaganda", [...] "Non-Zero Possibility", and [...] "Invalid Litter Dept."

2500|$|Dictionaries and {{scholars}} have offered {{a variety of}} definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: [...] "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" [...] and [...] "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology." [...] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 [...] "Real World of Technology" [...] lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is [...] "practice, the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> things around here." [...] The term {{is often used to}} imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole. Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as [...] "the pursuit of life by means other than life," [...] and as [...] "organized inorganic matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014 {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{in the aftermath}} of Operation Onymous that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: [...] "This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again." [...] A BBC source cited a [...] "technical breakthrough" [...] that allowed the tracking of the physical location of servers, and the number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit Tor project, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely. However, in November 2015 court documents on the matter generated serious ethical security research as well as Fourth Amendment concerns.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2009, Morehouse College {{initiated}} a campus wide attire policy that prohibits students from wearing women's clothes, jewelry on their teeth, pajamas as classroom attire, tight fitting caps or bandannas on their heads, or pants which hang below the waist at official college-sponsored events. This dress code {{is part of}} the Five Wells which holds that [...] "Morehouse Men are Renaissance Men with a social conscience and global perspective who are Well-Read, Well-Spoken, Well-Traveled, Well-Dressed and Well-Balanced." [...] William Bynum, vice president for Student Services was quoted by CNN as saying, [...] "We are talking about five students who are living a gay lifestyle that is leading them to dress [...] a <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not expect in Morehouse men." [...] These remarks and the attire policy itself have been the source of great controversy {{both on and off the}} campus. President Franklin personally sent out an email to the schools' alumni, clarifying that the university's attire policy is not intended as an affront to gays.|$|E

[...] However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a [...] "knee-jerk reaction," [...] saying that, [...] "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," [...] and that the block might [...] "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs.

[...] As a practical matter, he could solve his problem by getting a job; but, as a device for developing the novel's theme, his aloneness {{is a way of}} making him (and the reader) recognize that there is nothing inherent in the objective nature of the world that would give any necessary meaning to whatever actions he chose, and therefore nothing to restrict his freedom. [...] "is perception of the world around him becomes unstable as objects are disengaged from their usual frames of reference," [...] and he is forced to recognize that freedom is inescapable and that therefore creating a meaning for his life is his own responsibility.
