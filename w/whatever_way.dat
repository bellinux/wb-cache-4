She is presumably killed by Superman at the end of Year Five when she was helping Batwoman get to the alternate universe in order to get help from the alternate Justice League. This occurred, because Catwoman betrayed the Insurgency to save Batman's life.|$|E

[...] After the animation, artists duplicated the beads onto the animated geometry for a pre-simulated lighting version to get approval on how the object would read. Sims were then run [...] "on all the targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of the surface which would have its own set of parameters," [...] said Goodwin. [...] "The bead size or the turbulence that would crawl along the surface constantly updating the orientation was based on the normal provided by the surface. That was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as the final target for the simulation." [...] After the simulation process, Weta Digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove jitter to control the noise. Lighting solutions directly worked on the set. Weta utilized RenderMan to take advantage of improved ray tracing and instancing objects.|$|E

There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame.

It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous.

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 25, 2009, by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane. It was written by fellow executive producer and series regular Danny Smith and directed by Joseph Lee, during the show's eighth production season. The storyline was pitched by series regular Tom Devanney, and periodically references Billions and Billions (1997), a book of essays by Carl Sagan. [...] Seth MacFarlane asked Danny Smith to read Sagan's essay, [...] "Abortion: Is It Possible to Be Both 'Pro-Life' and 'Pro-Choice'", before beginning to write the script. The episode was originally intended to air {{along with the rest}} of the eighth season schedule, and was approved for production by 20th Century Fox. However, the Fox Broadcasting Company asserted their right not to air the episode due to the subject matter. This was the second time that MacFarlane had been warned by Fox about the sensitive nature of an episode's subject.

500|$|To {{promote his}} {{developing}} ideas for an expedition that would overwinter on the Antarctic continent at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink hurried to London, where the Royal Geographical Society was hosting the Sixth International Geographical Congress. On 1 August 1895 {{he addressed the}} conference, giving {{an account of the}} Cape Adare foreshore as a location where a scientific expedition might establish itself for the Antarctic winter. He described the site as [...] "a safe situation for houses, tents and provisions", and said there were indications that in this place [...] "the unbound forces of the Antarctic Circle do not display the full severity of their powers". He also suggested that the interior of the continent might be accessible from the foreshore by an easy route—a [...] "gentle slope". He ended his speech by declaring his willingness to lead an expedition there himself. Hugh Robert Mill, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: [...] "His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a fresh breeze of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink very much at that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some of us as boding well for exploration". The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas. Instead, it passed a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, to the effect that [...] "the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in <b>whatever</b> <b>way</b> seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century".|$|E
500|$|Some further {{procedural}} {{reforms were}} {{undertaken in the}} 1850s. In 1850, {{a new set of}} Chancery orders were produced by the Lord Chancellor, allowing Masters to speed up cases in <b>whatever</b> <b>way</b> they chose and allowing plaintiffs to file a claim, rather than the more expensive and long-winded bill of complaint. The Suitors in Chancery Relief Act 1852 gave all court officials salaries, abolished the need to pay them fees and made it illegal for them to receive gratuities; it also removed more sinecure positions. The Master in Chancery Abolition Act 1852 abolished the Masters in Chancery, allowing all cases to be heard directly by judges instead of bounced back-and-forth between judges and Masters. As a result of these reforms the court became far more efficient, and the backlog decreased; in the 1860s an average of 3,207 cases were submitted each year, while the Court heard and dismissed 3,833, many of them from the previous backlog. Much of this work was carried out by the growing number of clerks, however, and members of the legal profession became concerned about the [...] "famine" [...] of equity judges. Despite these reforms, it was still possible for Charles Dickens, writing in 1853 in the preface to his novel Bleak House, to bemoan the inefficiencies of the Court of Chancery. His novel revolves around a fictional long-running Chancery case, Jarndyce and Jarndyce. He observed that {{at the time he was}} writing there was a case before the Chancery court [...] "which was commenced nearly twenty years ago... and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun". He concluded that [...] "If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them on these pages, to the shame of a parsimonious public".|$|E

500|$|Stevens {{and other}} {{radicals}} were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, [...] "Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon". In April 1862, Stevens {{wrote to a}} friend, [...] "As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody." [...] The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: [...] "Stevens, Sumner and [...] Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. Wherever I go and <b>whatever</b> <b>way</b> I turn, they are on my tail, and still in my heart, I have the deep conviction that the hour [...] has not yet come." [...] The President stated that {{if it came to}} a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them [...] "the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with" [...] but [...] "with their faces... set Zionwards". Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. [...] Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln's policies, calling them [...] "flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community". Stevens generally opposed Lincoln's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. Stevens wrote a nephew in June 1863 saying, [...] "The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war." ...|$|E
