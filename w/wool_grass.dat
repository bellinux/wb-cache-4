50|$|Imperata cylindrica (commonly {{known as}} cogon grass , kunai grass , blady grass, alang-alang, cotton <b>wool</b> <b>grass,</b> kura-kura) is {{a species of}} grass in the family Poaceae. Red cultivars of the species grown as {{ornamental}} plants are known as Japanese bloodgrass.|$|E
5000|$|The nest is a bowl-shaped {{structure}} of twigs lined with available {{materials such as}} leaves, <b>wool,</b> <b>grass,</b> bark, feathers, or occasionally horse manure or hair from cattle. The sticks are generally 4 - 14 mm thick. Nests are sometimes renovated from previous years. A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid. Measuring 45 by 31 mm ( [...] × [...] in), eggs are green-cream and splotched with brown and grey markings. Eggs are laid every one to two days. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. Both parents feed the young.|$|E
50|$|Yellow wattlebirds nest in {{breeding}} pairs {{and aggressively}} defend their territories from other birds. The nest {{of the yellow}} wattlebird is made by the female alone, and is a large, open saucer-shaped structure made of twigs and bark that are bound by wool. The inside of the nest is lined with <b>wool</b> and <b>grass.</b> The nests can be up to 13 cm high and are found in trees or shrubs. Yellow wattlebirds lay 2-3 eggs that are salmon-red, spotted and blotched red-brown, purplish red and blue-grey. Both the males and females incubate the egg and feed the young.|$|R
500|$|Nests {{are lined}} with hair, <b>wool,</b> dead <b>grass</b> and many other materials. The eggs are a lighter colour than those of other corvids, being smooth, a glossy pale blue or blue-green with darker {{speckles}} ranging from dark brown to olive or grey-violet. Egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies; those of subspecies monedula average [...] and [...] in weight, those of subspecies soemmerringii [...] in size and [...] in weight, and those of subspecies spermologus [...] in size and [...] in weight. Clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs, although a Slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs. The eggs are incubated by the female for 17–18 days until hatching as naked altricial chicks, which are completely dependent on the adults for food. They fledge after 28–35 days, and the parents continue to feed them for another four weeks or so.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} initial {{concentrations}} of manganese {{on the overall}} removal efficiency of Mn by <b>wool</b> <b>grass,</b> soft rush, broad leaved cattail and soft stem bulrush plants was investigated under laboratory conditions. The translocation of Mn in the roots, stems, leaves and flowers of each plant species was determined and the fraction of Mn removed by precipitation was calculated. The overall manganese removal efficiencies of the system during the first period were 97. 66, 94. 09, 98. 51 and 98. 44 %, 90. 94, 95. 47, 96. 83 and 85. 51 % and 92. 65, 75. 55, 97. 56 and 75. 55 % which decreased to 82. 22, 89. 94, 95. 26 and 95. 85 %, 87. 78, 91. 85, 90. 49 and 84. 16 % and 38. 88, 61. 61, 31. 54 and 71. 64 % by the end (after 72 days) of the experiment for soft stem bulrush, <b>wool</b> <b>grass,</b> soft rush and cattail in the compartments receiving tolerance concentration, landfill leachate and the control, respectively. The removal of manganese was {{a function of the}} initial Mn concentration and the higher the initial concentration the higher the removal efficiency. The results showed the addition of manganese (from wastewater) to the soil by precipitation at average rates of 2. 17 and 17. 19 mg/kg/day, 2. 11 and 15. 75 mg/kg/day, 1. 71 and 15. 86 mg/kg/day and 1. 17 and 15. 29 mg/kg/day for soft stem bulrush, <b>wool</b> <b>grass,</b> soft rush and cattail in the compartments receiving landfill leachate and tolerance concentration, respectively. The leaves of <b>wool</b> <b>grass,</b> soft rush and cattail accumulated significantly greater concentrations of manganese than the roots with translocation factors > 1 indicating high translocation of Mn from root to shoot for the control, landfill leachate and tolerance concentration, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{kinetics}} of Mn removal by broad-leaved cattail, soft stem bulrush, soft rush and <b>wool</b> <b>grass</b> plants from contaminated wastewater under laboratory conditions. The approach used was based on a first order kinetic model which depended on the initial heavy metal concentration in the wastewater and allowed for the evaluation of the specific metal uptake rate and the maximum specific content of the metal in each plant species. The results showed that the model is capable of predicting the experimental data with relatively high confidence (R 2 = 0. 88). The specific Mn uptake rate and the maximum amount of Mn that can accumulate in each plant species were affected by the initial Mn concentration in the wastewater and the plant species. As the initial concentration of Mn in the water increased, the specific Mn uptake rate of each species decreased showing signs of toxicity. Broad-leaved cattail displayed the highest specific Mn uptake rates followed by soft stem bulrush, soft rush and <b>wool</b> <b>grass.</b> The maximum amount of Mn that accumulated in each species also increased as the initial Mn concentration in the wastewater increased. Broad-leaved cattail and soft stem bulrush plants would accumulate the highest amount of Mn in their tissues followed by soft rush and <b>wool</b> <b>grass...</b>|$|E
40|$|Growth and biomass {{accumulation}} of selected nutrients and trace metals were monitored for six species of aquatic macrophytes during June, August and November, 1993. Plant species were cultivated in two polyculture treatments, each replicated three times. Polyculture I consisted of Scirpus acutus (hardstem bullrush), Phragmites communes (common reed), and Phalaris arundinacea (canary grass). Polyculture H consisted of Typha spp. (cattail), Scirpus atrovirens (green bullrush), and Scirpus cyperinus (<b>wool</b> <b>grass).</b> Each {{of the six}} cells (6 x 9 x 0. 6 m), was operated as a gravel-substrate, subsurface-flow wetlands in a continuous recirculating mode. At six week intervals, macro, micro and trace elements were dissolved and added to the sump of the recirculating system. On each of three sampling dates, replicate shoot and root samples were collected, segregated by species and tissue type (roots, rhizomes, stems and leaves), and prepared for gravimetric biomass estimates and chemical analysis. Tissue specific concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu, were determined on each date for each species and tissue type. Results will be discussed with respect to species specific growth rates, biomass accumulation, and seasonal uptake and translocation of plant nutrients...|$|E
50|$|It was the Métis {{who led the}} {{explorer}} John Palliser into this district in 1858, and {{it was he who}} saw most of the country as barren and unsuitable for agriculture. 5 The botanist, John Macoun, traversing the same country in 1881, after the buffalo had been nearly wiped out, saw the country as an agricultural Eden. 6 A quarter of a century later, the first settlers arrived in the Luseland district, drawn by accounts of the rich pastures of prairie <b>wool</b> along the <b>Grass</b> Lake valley.

5000|$|Painted finches are monogamous and nest {{in simple}} pairs. [...] Nesting sites are usually well {{concealed}} clumps of spinifex grass, however pairs {{have been seen}} to nest in natural cavities {{near the top of}} a clump or on the ground at the base. Nesting sites may occasionally also include other species of tussock grasses or in low shrubs. [...] Individuals build loose, bottle shaped or domed nests with a wide entrance and usually consists of stems of spinifex but may also contain other grass stems, twigs or rootlets. The nest is often lined with feathers, plant down, hairy seeds, <b>grass,</b> <b>wool,</b> fur or balls of fluff. [...] The opening of the nest is often decorated with a piece of charcoal.|$|R
5000|$|The western silvereye usually {{builds a}} {{suspended}} cup-shaped nest of grasses in a shrub or tree. The grasses are bound with spider web {{and the inner}} cup lined with finer <b>grasses,</b> <b>wool</b> or horsehair. The cup is about 5 cm across and 2-3 cm deep. Clutch size is two or three, sometimes four, pale blue eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs {{for a period of}} 10-13 days, with the young birds leaving the nest about 12 days after hatching. [...] Breeding takes place mainly in the wetter, coastal part of the range from September to January, with the birds forming large flocks and moving further afield once breeding has ceased. When breeding conditions are good, pairs can produce and raise up to four broods in a season.|$|R
40|$|An {{implicit}} high-order compact {{unconditionally stable}} finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is proposed here for numerical solution of point sources over an impedance plane. In this method, the linearized Euler equations are split into three directional sets and twelve simple wave components, or six when equivalent sources are adopted with no mean flow. Each component is solved using a fourth-order Padé approximant {{in space and}} second-order trapezoidal integration in time. The concept of reflection coefficient is used and algebraically modeled to develop time-domain impedance-equivalent boundary conditions. Comparisons with established methods for reflections of harmonic or impulsive sources demonstrate the applicability of this method for general impedance value, source type, or their arbitrary distributions. Examples of using typical <b>wool</b> felt and <b>grass</b> ground impedances are given to illustrate its practicality and effectiveness. This method provides a means through which time-domain theories and procedures for in-situ characterization of impedance surfaces can be developed. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
500|$|The untidy nest is {{composed}} of hay, <b>grass,</b> <b>wool</b> or other material and lined with feathers, which improve the thermal insulation. A complete nest consists of three layers; base, lining and dome. The typical clutch is five or six eggs (rarely more than four in Malaysia), white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots, small blotches, or speckling; they are [...] in size and weigh , of which 7% is shell. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12–13 days before the altricial, naked chicks hatch, and a further 15–18 days elapse before they fledge. Two or three broods may be raised each year; birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs, but {{the reverse is true}} for second and third clutches. Females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time, so within-pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs' reproductive ability. There is a significant level of promiscuity; in a Hungarian study, more than 9% of chicks were sired by extra-pair males, and 20% of the broods contained at least one extra-pair young.|$|R
25|$|A box cooker has a {{transparent}} glass or plastic top, {{and it may}} have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. Thermal insulation for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150°C (300°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, <b>wool,</b> rags, dry <b>grass,</b> sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black tempera paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150°C (300°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.|$|R
