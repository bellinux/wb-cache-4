50|$|The {{fact that}} the States deemed it {{necessary}} to pass such an Act suggests <b>that</b> theatrical performances <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time frequent enough and of sufficient concern to the authorities to require the setting up of a regulatory system.

To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|E
