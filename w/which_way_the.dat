5|$|In {{response}} to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something theNew Scientisthas coinednominative determinism. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> arrow of causality points {{when it comes to}} names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E

25|$|The gimbal {{was first}} {{described}} by the Greek inventor Philo of Byzantium (280–220 BCE). Philo described an eight-sided ink pot with an opening on each side, which can be turned so that while any face is on top, a pen can be dipped and inked — yet the ink never runs out through the holes of the other sides. This {{was done by the}} suspension of the inkwell at the center, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> pot is turned.|$|E
25|$|A ball {{rotating}} {{around the}} seam will move either {{right or left}} when it hits the pitch, depending on <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> ball is spinning. A ball bouncing to the right {{is said to be}} an off cutter as it is travelling from off stump to leg stump for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This will cause the ball to catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the slips.|$|E
25|$|He {{went into}} law {{after the war}} and in 1921 set up his own practice. During {{the early years of the}} Austrian First Republic, he was close to the Fatherland Front. A {{successful}} lawyer, he was invited to join the cabinet of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933. Following Dollfuss' murder in 1934, he became a State Councillor from 1937 under Kurt Schuschnigg. A keen mountaineer, Seyss-Inquart became the head of the German-Austrian Alpine Club. He later became a devotee of Heinrich Himmler's concepts of racial purity and sponsored various expeditions to Tibet and other parts of Asia in hopes of proving Aryan racial concepts and theories. He was not initially a member of the Austrian National Socialist party, though he was sympathetic to many of their views and actions. By 1938, however, Seyss-Inquart knew <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> political wind was blowing and became a respectable frontman for the Austrian National Socialists.|$|E

500|$|Dylan earned {{yet another}} {{distinction}} in a 2007 study of US legal opinions and briefs that found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers {{more than those}} of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by the Beatles, who were second. Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included [...] "you don't need a weatherman to know <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> wind blows" [...] from [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues" [...] and [...] "when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose" [...] from [...] "Like a Rolling Stone".|$|E
500|$|Biographer Robert Shelton {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s, Dylan was {{frequently}} criticized for [...] "selling out" [...] and that people were pressuring him {{to go back to his}} earlier trend of composing protest songs. For Shelton, who noted the promotional photo for [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] depicting Dylan looking through a camera, the track expressed Dylan's wish just to be an observer, and not a political activist. Author Seth Rogovoy similarly interpreted the song as Dylan's desire to ignore politics and avoid getting involved in people's disputes. The line [...] " [...] keeps on rollin', though/No matter ... <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> wind does blow" [...] has been heard by writers Peter Vernezze and Carl J. Porter as evidence of Dylan's conviction that [...] "the river of time, the flow of facts, in reality remains unaffected by winds of beliefs, the flow of changing opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|After O'Leary's {{revelation that}} {{producers}} had rehearsed {{what would happen}} if Cole abstained in week 5, allegations were made that the result was rigged for Waissel to stay, given that her outlandish performances and growing unpopularity with the public resulted in better ratings and sensational press for the show. Cowell denied this claim, saying he would never want to defraud viewers and said the situation had [...] "been blown out of proportion". O'Leary defended himself and the show on Twitter, saying [...] "We never know <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> judges are going to vote. Ever. The only thing I know is who's in the bottom two when I'm given the card. I don't know which judge to go to until I'm called and the judges, including , don't know the vote or who we're coming to next. It's that simple." [...] The following week, Heat magazine printed a report claiming that Cowell was aware of the public votes before the judges make their votes, and several other media reports contained rumours of the show being fixed. The X Factor bosses instructed their lawyers to file a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission against Heat, saying that the article was a lie, that very few people know the actual public voting results and conspiracy theories being printed in the media are [...] "total and utter rubbish". Heat printed an apology in their 1 January 2011 issue and accepted that Cowell was unaware of the votes cast until after the final.|$|E

500|$|Wisden, {{taking into}} {{consideration}} Australia's post-war record and the West Indies' success during their 1950 tour of England, declared the 1951–52 series {{between the two sides}} to be, [...] "the unofficial cricket championship of the world". Hassett went into the First Test at Brisbane without playing a first-class match for the season due to the scheduling. However, this was negated {{by the fact that the}} tourists only had one match of comparable standard before the Tests, prompting Hassett to make some unusually blunt comments, saying that [...] "The West Indies have suffered from sheer stupidity in the organisation of their tour". Like many of the Australians, he struggled to pick the action of West Indian leg spinner Sonny Ramadhin. He was out for only six in the first innings, as Australia eked out a 10-run lead. He then managed 35 as Australia scraped home in the second innings by three wickets to 7/236. He had been dismissed by Ramadhin both times, bowled and lbw, unable to pick <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> ball was spinning. Between Tests, Hassett had an opportunity to rectify this problem when Victoria hosted the Caribbean tourists, but Ramadhin prevailed again, dismissing him for 12 in his only innings. Having worked out how to pick Ramadhin's variations, he compiled 132 and 46 not out in a seven-wicket win in the Second Test at Sydney. Hassett's century was part of a 235-run partnership with Keith Miller, an Australian Test record for any wicket against the West Indies. Ramadhin ended with 1/196 and was demoralised. Between Tests, Hassett's Victorians faced New South Wales in consecutive matches. Hassett scored 92 in the first encounter, a high-scoring draw, and his team had the upper hand in the latter, forcing their opponents to hold on with only three wickets remaining.|$|E
