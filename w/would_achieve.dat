5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the desired {{performance}}, Lockheed chose a minimalist approach: a design that <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> high performance by wrapping the lightest, most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine. The emphasis was on minimizing drag and mass.|$|E

5|$|Göring {{had promised}} Hitler that Adlertag and Adlerangriff <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> the results {{required}} within days, or at worst weeks. It {{had meant to}} {{be the beginning of}} the end of RAF Fighter Command, but Adlertag and the following operations failed to destroy the RAF, or gain the necessary local air superiority. As a result, Operation Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} unlikely that Liverpool {{would win the}} league. Despite scoring the most goals and conceding the fewest in the top three, they drew four matches more than second place Newcastle. However, Liverpool advanced through the semi-finals of the FA Cup, beating Aston Villa 3–0 {{to set up a}} final against Manchester United and the possibility that they <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> a league and cup double.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard. It was {{her second}} {{marriage}} and his first. Their son, Randall Hank Williams, who <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> fame {{in his own}} right as Hank Williams Jr., was born on May 26, 1949. The marriage, always turbulent, rapidly disintegrated, and Williams developed a serious problem with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his spina bifida. The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.|$|E
50|$|In April 2009 the Government set a {{requirement}} for a 34% cut in emissions by 2020, {{in line with the}} recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change, and announced that details of how this <b>would</b> be <b>achieved</b> <b>would</b> be published in the summer.|$|R

5|$|This outcome came {{also as a}} {{surprise}} to most of the Targowica Confederates, who had wished only to restore the status quo ante bellum (Commonwealth magnate-favoring Golden Freedoms) and had expected that the overthrow of the 3 May Constitution <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> that end, and nothing more. The last bid to restore the reformed Commonwealth came with the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. The uprising failed and resulted in the Third Partition in 1795, in which the country lost all its remaining territories and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble <b>would</b> <b>achieve,</b> though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
5|$|In his frigate HMS Phoenix, Halstead {{was able}} to cut the Batavian frigate Argo off from the shore {{and bring it to}} battle, forcing it to {{surrender}} in just 20 minutes as other British ships closed with the combat. The remainder of the Batavian squadron had dispersed eastwards away from the frigates and Duncan's fleet, pursued by the frigate HMS Pegasus and brig-sloop HMS Sylph. After a lengthy chase, Phoenix caught the cutter Duke of York, Sylph seized the brig Mercury, while Pegasus succeeded in driving the other brigs, Echo and Gier ashore, where both were believed wrecked. Duncan's blockade of the Texel was instrumental in British control of the North Sea, and a year later it <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> a decisive victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E

5|$|By 11 a.m., it {{was clear}} that a {{breakthrough}} was not forthcoming and the advances by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received a message from McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson's corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly under the impression that McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with a message that was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts"The Stars and Stripes are flying over them."—and that another push along the line <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> victory for the Union Army. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed the dispatch to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby's division to aid McClernand.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{a backup}} pilot for Shepard and Grissom {{on the first}} two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions. Glenn was {{selected}} for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASA's first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> one of Project Mercury's most important goals. Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 and Liberty Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepard's spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the side like the one on his F-86 had been. Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hanger and altitude test, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{he began}} the year with 26 and two against Queensland, and then a 43 against New South Wales. A series of low scores {{followed}} until he hit a vein of strong form beginning in February of that year. He scored 63 against Western Australia on 16 February 1940 in his last match of the 193940 season. He began the following season with 41 in the following match against New South Wales. Hamence then enjoyed great success against Victoria, where he scored 130 and 103 not out in one inter-state match, and then 85 and 62 in the next. Following this, in a match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between two representative selections {{to raise money for}} the war effort, he played for Don Bradman's XI and scored 73 and 35. He returned to play for South Australia for a match against New South Wales, where he scored 31 and five. He ended the 194041 season with the highest average for a single season he <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> in his career, 569runs at 63.22, with two hundreds.|$|E

5|$|Selena {{signed a}} record deal with EMI {{subsidiary}} SBK Records in November 1993, following her Grammy Award nomination for Live (1993). The {{news of the}} singer's record deal was front-page news in Billboard magazine. In a 1994 meeting, Selena expressed her guilt to Behar; Selena had told interviewers of her upcoming crossover album and told them the recording {{was expected to be}} release soon. At the time, Selena had not recorded a single song for her planned English-language debut. Behar subsequently told Koppelman that Selena and her band would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman to force the crossover album to begin; EMI relented and the recording sessions began. Selena said she felt intimidated by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and only a few people had believed she <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> success in the pop market.|$|E
5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} Thursday 6 May 2010 and saw an increase in voter turnout from 61% in 2005 to 65% in 2010. Throughout the day GfK NOP and Ipsos MORI conducted an exit poll {{on behalf of the}} BBC, Sky and ITV news services – the results of which were announced as the polls closed at 10:00pm. Data gathered from individuals at 130 polling stations around the country suggested a hung parliament, with an initial estimate that the Conservative Party <b>would</b> <b>achieve</b> 307 seats–19 seats short of a controlling majority. This deficit was later adjusted to 21 seats. The distribution of seats was initially predicted to be 307 to the Conservatives, 255 to Labour, 59 to the Liberal Democrats and 29 to the other parties, but these figures were later updated with a minor adjustment in Labour's favour. The apparently poor prospects for the Liberal Democrats were a surprise to commentators, as many previous opinion polls had indicated they would receive more seats. A later BBC exit poll published at 5:36am on Friday 7 May predicted the Conservatives on 306, 20 short of an overall majority, with Labour on 262, and the Liberal Democrats on 55.|$|E
