5|$|Calcraft {{was born}} in Baddow, near Chelmsford, in 1800. He was a cobbler by trade, but had also worked as a nightwatchman at Reid's brewery in Clerkenwell, London. While {{attempting}} {{to earn a living}} by selling meat pies on the streets around Newgate Prison he made the acquaintance of John Foxton, who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of London's hangman for 40years. That meeting led to his employment at Newgate to flog juvenile offenders, for which he was paid 10shillings a week.|$|E

5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they ought to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|As a {{manufacturing}} center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, {{known as the}} Pittsburgh Railway Riots. Militia and federal troops were called {{to the city to}} suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors could provide a multimillion-dollar economic boost for a host city and region while requiring few, if any, additional facilities. One early contender <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|Plague cases {{continued}} to occur sporadically at a modest rate until {{the summer of}} 1666. On {{the second and third}} of September that year, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire {{put an end to the}} epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolutionary Wars, {{which began}} in 1792 as a {{conflict}} between the new French Republic and the Austrian Empire following the French Revolution, spread in 1793 to involve {{a number of other}} European nations, including Spain and Great Britain. In addition to these external threats, political tensions within France led to a series of uprisings against the Republic in the summer of 1793, particularly in the south of the country. One of the centres of Royalist activity <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Toulon, the major naval base and home port for the powerful French Mediterranean Fleet. On 28 August, after fighting between Republican forces and British troops for control of the heights overlooking the city, Toulon surrendered to Lord Hood, commander of the British Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet. Hood's forces occupied the city, seized the French fleet in harbour and called for reinforcements to defend Toulon against the inevitable Republican counterattack, receiving Spanish, Neapolitan and Sardinian contingents over the following weeks as the Siege of Toulon developed.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Audiencia of Quito (or Presidency of Quito) was {{established}} {{as part of}} the Spanish State by Philip II of Spain on August 29, 1563. It was a court of the Spanish Crown with jurisdiction over certain territories of the Viceroyalty of Peru (and later the Viceroyalty of New Granada) that now constitute Ecuador and parts of Peru, Colombia and Brazil. The Royal Audiencia was created to strengthen administrative control over those territories and to rule the relations between whites and the natives.

5|$|The local {{authority}} of the city <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of Ely Urban District Council from 1894 to 1974. The Isle of Ely County Council governed the Isle of Ely administrative county that surrounding and included the city from 1889 to 1965. In 1965 there was a reform of local government that merged the county council with that of Cambridgeshire to form the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council. In 1974 {{as part of a}} national reform of local government, the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council merged with the Huntingdon and Peterborough County Council to form the Cambridgeshire County Council. The City of Ely Urban District Council became the City of Ely Council, a parish council which covers the same area but with fewer powers, and the East Cambridgeshire District Council which covers a wider area.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{target for}} the bomb <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Kokura, but it {{was found to be}} obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E

5|$|The years 1264–1267 saw the {{conflict}} {{known as the}} Second Barons' War, in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the King. The first scene of battle <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Gloucester, which Edward managed to retake from the enemy. When Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, came to {{the assistance of the}} rebels, Edward negotiated a truce with the earl, the terms of which he later broke. Edward then captured Northampton from Montfort's son Simon, before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby's lands. The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the Battle of Lewes, on 14May 1264. Edward, commanding the right wing, performed well, and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort's forces. Unwisely, however, he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit, and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated. By the agreement known as the Mise of Lewes, Edward and his cousin Henry of Almain were given up as hostages to Montfort.|$|E
5|$|In March, 1944, the {{division}} {{was transferred to}} the 71st Rifle Corps, where it would remain {{for the duration of the}} conflict. At about the same time, the 31st Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. In the initial stages of Operation Bagration, the front's immediate objective <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Orsha. The 331st had the direct support of the 959th SU Regiment (SU-76s) for its initial assault; this regiment had been assigned to support of the corps since the beginning of June. In recognition of the 331st's role in the liberation of Orsha, on June 27, it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. The division went on to assist in the liberation of Borisov. While two divisions of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps of the 11th Guards Army attacked from the west and north, the 331st drove into the south of the city and it was cleared of German forces by 3:00 am on July 1. In the following days it took part in the liberation of Minsk, before joining the general advance to the 1941 Soviet-German frontier. In recognition of his successful command of {{the division}} in this operation, Major General Berestov was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union on June 27, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Docks {{had been}} {{gradually}} declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under {{competition from the}} new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 {{the need for a}} Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market, in which girls and women butchered sheep and cattle until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. At its peak, around 1907, over 234,000 animals were imported annually through the market, but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40,000 a year. The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (newsprint importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home development scheme. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.|$|E

5|$|The largest French {{resupply}} {{effort of}} the Napoleonic Wars was a squadron under Contre-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, sent to Santo Domingo in December 1805 with troops and supplies. In conjunction with a second squadron under Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, this force was then ordered to raid British trade routes and disrupt the movement of British merchant shipping across the Atlantic. Leissègues reached Santo Domingo in February 1806, but within days a British battle squadron had intercepted and destroyed his force at the Battle of San Domingo. Willaumez was able to avoid attack by British forces {{during the spring of}} 1806, and cruised in the Caribbean during much of the summer, but his force was eventually dispersed by a hurricane in August and the survivors forced to shelter on the American Eastern Seaboard. Unaware of the dispersal of Willaumez's squadron, the British naval authorities sought to block its return to Europe by stationing strong battle squadrons off the principal French Atlantic ports. One of their most important targets <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Rochefort, heavily fortified port in which a powerful French naval force was based, and a squadron of six Royal Navy ships of the line was assigned to watch it in case Willaumez attempted to return there. In August, command of the blockade squadron was awarded to Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, a highly experience naval commander.|$|E
