At school, he achieved B and C grades, putting in the minimum amount of effort, but his mind remained on hockey, and specifically goaltending. [...] "Everybody else would be working and I'd be drawing pictures of Tony Esposito and Jimmy Rutherford," [...] he recalled.

500|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his first}} year in Leipzig, for the Second Day of Christmas. On this day Leipzig celebrated Christmas and St. Stephen's Day in alternating years, with different readings.

[...] The cantata text by an unknown author is not related to the martyrdom, but generally reflects Jesus as the conqueror of sin and the works of the devil. The text quotes the Bible in movement 1, a verse from the First Epistle of John (...) [...] The contemporary poetry alludes to the Bible several times. Movement 2 is based on the Gospel of John (...)

2500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} {{responsibility for}} a transgression through {{the form of an}} apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. [...] While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known my exgirlfriend was {{going to be at the}} party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.”). [...] Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. [...] For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”).|$|E

2500|$|Romney has not {{put forward}} a clear {{statement}} {{as to whether he}} supports and would have signed, or would have opposed, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require that employers prove that differences in pay are based on qualifications, not gender, and extends the statute of limitations for filing claims of wage discrimination. The legislation was opposed by all but two Republicans in the House of Representatives and five in the Senate; {{and it was the first}} piece of legislation signed into law by President Obama. Asked in an [...] April 2012 interview if he would have signed the bill had it come before him as president, Romney said, [...] "It’s certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing.

The following day, the campaign adviser retracted his statement, saying that he was wrong when he said that Romney had been opposed to the act.|$|E
