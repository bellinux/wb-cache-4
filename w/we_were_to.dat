But light is no real property of mass. The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing against the existence of numberless invisible ones.|$|E

25|$|For twenty-eight days we were prisoners. Sentries at our cabin doors day and night, sentries on deck {{during the}} hour we were daily {{permitted}} to breathe the fresh air.

25|$|In antiquity, {{notwithstanding}} {{the success of}} priests, astrologers and astronomers in predicting solar and lunar eclipses, the solstices and the equinoxes of the Sun and {{the period of the}} Moon, there was nothing other than a set of algorithms to help them.

25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> {{divide the}} dynamic {{pressure}} by {{the product of}} fluid density and acceleration due to gravity, g, the result is called velocity head, which is used in head equations like the one used for pressure head and hydraulic head.

An alternative to velocity head is dynamic head.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Leone di Modena, a 17th-century Venetian {{critic of}} Kabbalah, wrote that if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be {{compatible}} with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the kabbalistic doctrine of the sephirot. This critique {{was in response to}} the knowledge that some European Jews of the period addressed individual sephirot in some of their prayers, although the practice was apparently uncommon. Apologists explain that Jews may have been praying for and not necessarily to the aspects of Godliness represented by the sephirot.|$|E
25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E

25|$|I {{was often}} {{asked if he}} had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy {{capacity}} to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E

500|$|The final straw {{for many}} regular {{officers}} was Prime Minister Robert Menzies' announcement that all commands in the Second AIF {{would go to}} Militia officers, which Berryman considered [...] "a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water.

500|$|The {{series was}} {{successfully}} nominated in 2009, {{but failed to}} merit an award.

500|$|Love's Labour's Lost, thought Hazlitt, [...] "transports us {{quite as}} much to the manners of the court, and the quirks of the courts of law, as to the scenes of nature or the fairy-land of [...] own imagination. Shakespear has set himself to imitate the tone of polite {{conversation}} then prevailing among the fair, the witty, and the learned". [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> part with any of the author's comedies", he writes, [...] "it should be this." [...] Yet he also mentions many amusing characters, dramatic scenes, and noble lines of poetry he would not willingly part with, quoting at length long passages spoken by both Biron and by Rosaline.|$|E

500|$|... "Hook Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Jessica and Lisa Origliasso {{together}} with Shelly Peiken and Greg Wells – Wells also produced the track. The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and out for {{just a little bit of}} time-whether it's in a relationship or in life. I guess we went through that a little bit when things started getting full on with us. It went from one extreme, where no one knew who <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> <b>to</b> the complete opposite".|$|E
