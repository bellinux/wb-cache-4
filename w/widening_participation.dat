2500|$|The {{university}} college underwent significant {{expansion in the}} 1920s, when it moved from the centre of Nottingham to a large campus on the city's outskirts. The new campus, called University Park, was completed in 1928, and financed by an endowment fund, public contributions, and the generosity of Sir Jesse Boot (later Lord Trent) who presented [...] to the City of Nottingham in 1921. Boot and his fellow benefactors sought to establish an [...] "elite seat of learning" [...] committed to <b>widening</b> <b>participation,</b> and hoped that the move would solve the problems facing University College Nottingham, in its restricted building on Shakespeare Street. Boot stipulated that, whilst part of the Highfields site, lying south-west of the city, should be devoted to the University College, the rest should provide a place of recreation for {{the residents of the}} city, and, {{by the end of the}} decade, the landscaping of the lake and public park adjoining University Boulevard was completed. The original University College building on Shakespeare Street in central Nottingham, known as the Arkwright Building, now forms part of Nottingham Trent University's City Campus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Widening</b> <b>participation</b> is a Government {{policy in}} the United Kingdom which {{attempts}} to widen {{access to higher education}} by increasing numbers of under-represented groups including ethnic minorities, disabled people and those from lower income families. <b>Widening</b> <b>participation</b> is a strategic aim of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the body which allocates funding to Universities. The Bristol admissions dispute is one of two policial controversies over <b>widening</b> <b>participation</b> that occurred during the 2000s. In 2000 the Laura Spence Affair involved the rejection of a state school student who applied to study Medicine at Oxford University and resulted in similar debate about <b>widening</b> <b>participation.</b> Bristol University first introduced a <b>widening</b> <b>participation</b> scheme in 1999 after the Dearing Report, a report which gave recommendations to the government on the expansion and funding of the British higher education system. Bristol's policy was in part a result of this report as well as being a principled attempt by the University to attract applications from state schools, something Bristol has traditionally struggled to do.|$|E
