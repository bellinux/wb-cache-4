5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, <b>whereas,</b> <b>in</b> prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, <b>whereas</b> <b>in</b> prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.|$|E
