25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> {{on the fact that}} we were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E

2500|$|This {{resulted}} in the Education Reform Act 1990 (NSW) (now the Education Act 1990). Prior to its assent on 1 June 1990, school education in New South Wales had been provided under a law developed 110 years earlier by Henry Parkes and William Wilkins in their [...] "Public Instruction Act 1880 (NSW)". On {{the significance of this}} law, Metherell said in early 1990: [...] "Chifley in his time was thought of as somewhat of an ogre, but now when <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on Ben Chifley we reflect upon his statesmanship. People will eventually thank me for these reforms - this is a blueprint for education into the 21st century".|$|E

[...] "My whole thing", he says, [...] "is I don't want to just break records. I want to set myself apart from any record that's been done before." [...] Wallenda lives by the mantra [...] "Never Give Up". [...] He believes that through hard work, one can achieve anything they desire. [...] "I think [...] what life is about", he remarks. [...] "We all go through challenges. But once we get through them, <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and say look how much our lives have changed by going through that challenge." ...|$|E

[...] There were pan-Orthodox celebrations; Sunday of Orthodoxy gatherings were major events and the spirit of the faithful and clergy was elevated in this gathering of the Church. [...] Now <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> just ten years later and find the gathering of bishops at Ligonier is hailed as the greatest event of American Orthodoxy! [...] I wonder how the canonization of America's first saint is relegated to some lesser place in the life of Orthodoxy in America. [...] Even Ligonier was hopeful {{to those of us who}} were serving the churches in multiple jurisdictions. [...] Soon we were disappointed when hierarchs removed their names from the documents that were prepared; one on evangelism and the other on administrative unity.|$|E

60|$|I {{stared at}} Lop-Ear, {{and he stared}} back. We {{understood}} each other. Immediately, and with great caution and quietness, we began climbing up the cliff.

60|$|Presently {{we came to}} a {{path that}} ran to the kraal from the ford of the Umfolozi. It was by it that the Impi had travelled.

Then <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> and lo! there behind us were the pursuers--five of them--one had drowned in crossing the river.|$|R

Happily for me, my husband knew from the beginning that I really loved him: he gave me a second chance of telling him so, after I had lost the first, and, as you see, I was wise enough to take it. You ought to be especially interested, my love, in this marriage, for you are the cause of it. If I had not gone to Aldborough to search for the lost trace of you--if George had not been brought there at the same time by circumstances in which you were concerned, my husband and I might never have met.
