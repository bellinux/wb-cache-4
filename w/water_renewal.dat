40|$|Abstract: Benthic foraminifera {{are shown}} to reflect both natural (including climatic) and human-induced {{environmental}} alterations {{over the last}} 1500 years in Drammensfjord, Norway. Today, Drammensfjord is a 124 m deep, partly anoxic, hyposaline basin (salinity < 32 %o) separated from the adjoining Oslo Fjord by a sill at 10 m water depth. It has been affected by human-induced organic pollution {{for more than a}} century. Based on major faunal trends, sediment characteristics and concentrations of plant fragments and pollen grains, four environmental zones are distinguished. The faunal composition of zones 1 - 3 (before AD 500 to about AD 1850) reflects the natural environmental development from a period with frequent deep <b>water</b> <b>renewals</b> and diverse, calcareous dominated assemblages, to periods with increasing river flow which impeded effective deep <b>water</b> <b>renewals,</b> and gave rise to agglutinated assemblages of low diversity. Increasing human-induced organic flux over the last 130 - 140 years has elevated the redox cline. The general faunal responses as represented by zone 4 are: 1) development from agglutinated assemblages of zone 3 via assemblages dominated by Spiroplectammina biformis or Stainforthia fusiformis to the present anoxic, afaunal conditions, and 2) strongly increasing foraminiferal abundance with maximum values just prior to the afaunal intervals. The approach has considerable potential for differentiating the effects of pollution from the natural ’background’...|$|R

40|$|The first high-precision {{radiocarbon}} {{measurements for}} the upper ocean are presented for banded corals from two sites in the North Atlantic Ocean. The striking dissimilarities between the post- 1950 records at Bermuda in the Sargasso Sea and the Florida Straits in the Gulf Stream illustrate the different mixing processes in the upper ocean at each site. Convective overturn associated with 18 ° degree water formation during late winter in the northern Sargasso Sea facilitates storage of considerable quantities of bomb radiocarbon at depth, which accounts for the damping of the Δ 14 C signal at Bermuda during the 1960 s. A multibox isopycnal mixing model is used to estimate the ventilation rate of the upper 700 m of the water column in the Sargasso Sea from 1950 to 1983. An inverse model is used; that is, the <b>water</b> mass <b>renewal</b> rate was calculated for the post-bomb period {{in order to satisfy}} the bomb radiocarbon time history in the corals. Sea water radiocarbon measurements made during the GEOSECS (1972 – 1973) and Transient Tracers in the Ocean (1980 – 1981) surveys are used to constrain the subsurface radiocarbon values calculated by the model. Results show that the rate of <b>water</b> mass <b>renewal</b> in the Sargasso Sea was high during 1963 – 1964, decreased during the late 1960 s, and remained low during most of the 1970 s.

As another unusual anomaly, this hydrographic blocking of seawater seems to persist in calm periods even in the winter, denying import of the usual winterly bottom <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> that otherwise is normal in fjords, and leading to a decrease in Botn's deep water oxygen levels during winter.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of ventilation timescales and radiocarbon (14 C) uptake to subgrid-scale mixing parameterization is studied {{in a global}} ocean model. Seven experiments are examined that are identical in every manner except their representation of subgrid-scale mixing of tracers. The cases include (i) two runs with traditional Cartesian mixing (HOR), (ii) a run with enhanced isopycnal mixing (ISO), and (iii) four runs in which the effects of eddies on the mean ocean flow are parameterized following Gent and McWilliams (GM). Horizontal, isopycnal, and isopycnal-thickness diffusion coefficients are varied sequentially in the model runs. Of particular interest {{is the role of}} the tracer mixing schemes in influencing longer timescale ventilation processes—centennial and beyond—such as deep <b>water</b> mass <b>renewal</b> and circulation. Simulated ventilation timescales and 14 C vary greatly between the three mixing schemes. The isopycnal mixing run exhibits the most rapid <b>water</b> mass <b>renewal</b> due to strong diffusion effects and excessive surface convective overturn, particularly in the Southern Ocean. In contrast, the GM cases show much more gradual renewal of deep and bottom waters, with limited vertical convection of surface waters and slower abyssal currents.

A general fish bioaccumulation model extended with terms that account for effects of tank <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rate and system losses of chemicals, predicted strong effects of the <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rate of depuration tanks on geosmin depuration from European eel. Model predictions were validated in a depuration experiment with geosmin-loaded European eel (n = 95) with a mean (SD) individual weight of 134. 4 (5. 0) g and a mean (SD) lipid content of 33. 7 (2. 8) % (w/w). Fish were depurated for 24, 48 or 72 h at three different tank <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rates (0. 3, 3. 3 and 33 day- 1).

Eels eliminated geosmin from their bodies, but unlike the model predicted, this was independent of the <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rate of the depuration tanks. Although being eliminated from the fish, geosmin hardly appeared and certainly did not accumulate in {{the water of the}} depuration tanks as the model predicted. This observation may be explained by geosmin being eliminated from eel as metabolite rather than the parent compound. Geosmin elimination from eel seems not to occur according to the generally accepted passive diffusion mechanism for excretion of lipophilic chemicals, and geosmin biotransformation by the eel seems indicated. Clearly geosmin depuration from European eel cannot be enhanced by increasing <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rates of depuration tanks...|$|E

Aracena and La Minilla reservoirs were studied since July 1973 and El Gergal reservoir since October 1979. The results allowed the examination of the different factors which control thc interannual variability of the trophic state of the reservoirs. Because of the high variability of average yearly rainfall, that is characteristic of the Mediterranean climate asea, the <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rate of the reservoirs varies greatly from year to year. This <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rate plays a more important role than nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability in controlling algal biomass and consequently, primary production. Nevertheless, its relative importance depends on the phosphorus loading of each reservoir. In the case of La Minilla reservoir, <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rate is the only factor significantly correlated with phytoplankton biomass. In Aracena and El Gergal reservoirs both renewal rate and nutrient concentrations can account for the differences in biomass. In Aracena reservoir the highest phytoplankton biomass peaks occured in certain summers at the beginning of its history (when N/P ratio is less than 10) due to blooms of nitrogen fixing Cyanophyceae, but <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rate turned to be a more important controlling factor than nutrient concentration as years passed by.

Sills between fjords restrict bottom water circulation and in Frierfjord (sill depth: 23 m, max. water depth: 100 m) efficient deep <b>water</b> <b>renewals</b> at depths greater than about 50 m occur once every one to three years (Rygg et al., 1987).

Investigations of short sediment cores (50 m) show that Stainforthia fusiformis exhibits typical opportunistic features.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>renewal</b> {{and mixing}} are highly {{related to the}} {{evolution}} of the ecological status in harbour areas and are crucial for environmental harbour management. For the first time, these processes have been studied in the Barcelona harbour with a high resolution 3 D hydrodynamic model. This harbour is representative of a semi-enclosed domain with a complex coastline in a micro-tidal environment (like most Mediterranean harbours). The tracking of numerical Lagrangian particles deployed in the flow was used to parameterize the surface <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> mechanisms. The use of Finite Size Lyapunov Exponents {{has proven to be a}} relatively easy and efficient way to characterize the mixing patterns. The complex geometry of the harbour and the meteo-oceanographic forcings lead to intricate hydrodynamics that define spatial heterogeneity of <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> and mixing. The most favourable conditions for enhancing surface <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> and mixing have been identified in idealized scenarios and realistic simulations. In general, renewal is enhanced near the harbour mouths and strongly limited in the inner areas. However, under particular forcing conditions, the residence time can decrease even in the most sheltered areas. The presence of two mouths in the harbour seems to favour <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> in comparison to harbours with only one mouth. Mixing is mainly induced by the action of wind forcing, while external shelf currents are much less efficient. The study of two realistic simulations suggests that harbour response to real forcing cannot be deduced from the combination of simple idealized scenarios. The time evolution of the forcings and the transient response of the system play a key role in defining the residence time patterns. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

All reservoirs received the same incoming water through a tidal channel, but they differed in <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> regime. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Discriminant Analysis were {{used to evaluate the}} similarity among sites, stations and sampling occasions. Different levels of taxonomic resolution (family, large taxonomic groups and phylum level) were also evaluated. The separation of sites and stations became unclear using high taxonomic levels. Results from the multivariate analyses suggest a slight differentiation of the stations according to sampling occasion but a clear differentiation of the several water reservoirs. Some of the lagoons studied with low <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rates showed strong environmental variations. They were characterised by low diversity indexes and abundance of small-sized organisms. Other lagoons, with high <b>water</b> <b>renewal</b> rates, showed low environmental variation and well diversified and structured benthic communities.
