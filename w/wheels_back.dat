The Bleriot XI had pivoting main gear legs, which passively allowed the main gear wheels to castor together about each of their vertical axes as a unit to allow small-angle crosswind landings, with bungee-cord loaded rigging members between the lower ends of the main wheel forks, to bring the <b>wheels</b> <b>back</b> to a [...] "directly-ahead" [...] orientation after touchdown.|$|E
5000|$|To {{raise the}} bridge an initial lift {{to the inner}} end of the bridge is required. This raises the inner <b>wheels</b> <b>back</b> up the {{inclines}} of the granite slabs. At {{the same time the}} outer ends are pulled from the lip of the granite slab, the wheels rolling down the sprung metal guides. When the inner wheels are pulled up onto the metal trays the weight of the lifting arms assists the raising of the bridge to a point where the centre of gravity of the arms is over the pivot of the upper support stays. From here on the pull necessary to raise the centre wheels is negligible. Once the lifting arms are in the fully retracted position the centre wheels are on top of the metal trays and the axles disengage from the cups. The bridge now sits on its inner two axles. From here it is necessary to pull the bridge in until the outer two wheels arrive at the trays. The bridge is then pulled within the gates on all six wheels.|$|E

50|$|As {{sunlight}} shines on {{the solar}} array, it transfers {{energy to the}} electrons within the photovoltaic cells, thus allowing them to conduct electricity and causing a current to flow. This current then travels to the MPPTs which alter the load across the solar array {{in order to ensure}} that it is generating electricity as efficiently as possible. The MPPTs have to constantly monitor the output of the photovoltaic cells because that output depends on the light intensity which can change rapidly if some cells become shaded. The electricity then flows into the battery where it can be stored for later use such as to drive the car while there is no sunlight. Although the battery is primarily charged by the solar panels, it can also be externally charged by the conventionally generated electricity at your home or workplace. The battery then discharges the current into the motor controllers which converts it into a form that can be used to power the electric motor. Motor controllers are also used to manage things like speed regulation, cruise control and regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is using the existing motors as generators by converting the rotational energy of the <b>wheels</b> <b>back</b> into electrical energy, slowing the car down and recharging the battery at the same time, instead of just using conventional mechanical breaks. Lastly, the energy that was once in the sunlight shining on the car, reaches the electric motors which operate on the principles of electromagnetism to turn that electrical energy into rotational energy that spins the wheels and drives the car forward.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Modern and {{advanced}} mountain tractor allows four different modes of steering wheels: front <b>wheels,</b> <b>back</b> wheels, four wheels and crab steering. The current paper presents {{the impact of}} different ways of steering to control the slip in the work transverse on the steep hill slope (39. 08 %). Design/methodology/approach: For each mode of steering eight measurements were made; four measurements at a forecasted speed of 0. 69 m/s and four measurements at a speed of 1. 39 m/s. During the two of four measurements the travelling direction was from the left to the right, and vice versa. Findings: The measured slip depended significantly on the steering system, while the driving direction did not cause any differences in the slip. Research limitations/implications: The experiment results presented herein can be applied only with the similar mountain tractors, which allows four different modes of steering wheels. Additional limitation represents the working polygon and the growing conditions of grass. Practical implications: The crab - steering resulted in the smallest slip (5. 96 %) at the average driving speed of 1. 08 m/s. When steering with all four wheels, the slip at the average speed of 1. 03 m/s increased to 7. 27 %. The biggest slip was measured when steering with only front wheels was applied. In this case the slip was 8. 07 % at the average speed of 1. 01 m/s. Originality/value: The findings from our experiments indicated {{that it is very}} useful to have all wheels steering tractor when working on step slope, because it is grass friendly, offers bigger agility of tractor and improve the safety of the operator...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} a novel pushrim-activated, power-assisted wheelchair (PAPAW) for compliance with wheelchair standards, metabolic energy cost during propulsion, and ergonomics during selected {{activities of daily}} living (ADLs). Design: A 3 -phase study, the second and third of which were repeated-measures designs. Setting: A rehabilitation engineering center within a Veterans Affairs medical center. Patients: Eleven full-time, community-dwelling, manual wheelchair users (4 women, 6 men) with spinal cord injuries or multiple sclerosis. Interventions: Phase 1 : Compliance testing, with a test dummy, in accordance with the wheelchair standards of the American National Standards Institute and the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America. Phase 2 : Metabolic energy consumption testing - at 2 speeds and 3 resistance levels - in subjects' manual wheelchair and the PAPAW. Phase 3 : Evaluation of ability to perform ADLs and ergonomics of the PAPAW compared with the subjects personal wheelchair. Main Outcome Measures: Phase 1 : The PAPAW's static stability, static strength, impact strength, fatigue strength, environmental response, obstacle climbing ability, range, maximum speed, and braking distance. Phase 2 : Subjects' oxygen consumption per minute, minute ventilation, and heart rate during different speeds and workloads with a PAPAW and their own wheelchairs. Phase 3 : Subject ratings of perceived comfort and basic ergonomics while performing selected ADLs. Completion time, stroke frequency, and heart rate during each ADL. Results: Phase 1 : The PAPAW was found to be in compliance with wheelchair standards. Phase 2 : With the PAPAW, the user had a significantly lower oxygen consumption (Vo 2 mL/min: p <. 0001; Vo 2 mL/kg × min: p <. 0001) and heart rate (p <. 0001) when compared with a manual wheelchair at different speeds. Phase 3 : The PAPAW had a significantly higher mean ergonomic evaluation (p <. 01) than the subjects' personal wheelchairs. The results of comparing the ratings of the car transfer between the PAPAW and the subjects' personal wheelchair showed {{a significant difference in the}} task of taking the wheels off (p <. 001) and putting the <b>wheels</b> <b>back</b> on (p =. 001), with the PAPAW receiving lower ratings. Conclusion: This study indicated that the PAPAW is compliant with wheelchair standards, reduces the energy demand placed on the user during propulsion, and that subjects rated its ergonomics favorably when compared with their personal wheelchair. PAPAWs may provide manual wheelchairs with a less physiologically stressful means of mobility with few adaptations to the vehicle or home environment. © 2001 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic servo {{controls}} {{are designed to}} facilitate rotation in place without providing increased ppower to steering wheels. In the initial design phase, the dimensions required for control systems are usually obtained through the calculation of their load when wheels rotate in place, where the torque is calculated empirically. The starting point in the project calculation is thus to determine the hydraulic power steering torque torsional resistance which is then {{used to determine the}} maximum value of force i. e. the torque on the stering wheel. The calculation of the control system servo control consists of determining the basic parameters, the required pump capacity, the main dimensions of the hub and the  pipeline and the conditions for the stability of the system control mechanism. Introduction The aim of the calculation of the steering control system is to determine the basic parameters of its components which ensure the fulfilment of requirements of the control system. Calculations are performed in several stages with a simultaneous  detailed constructive analysis of the control system leading to the best variant. At each stage, design and control calculations of the hydraulic servo of the steering mechanism are performed. The design allows the computation to complete the selection of basic dimensions of the amplifer elements, starting from the approved scheme and the basic building loads of approximate values. Calculations control is carried out to clarify the structural solution and to obtain the output characteristics of the control amplifier which are applied in the  estimation of  potential properties of the structure. Project calculation Baseline data must be sufficiently reliable, ie. must correspond to the construction characteristics of the vehicle design and the control system as well as to service conditions [...] A proper deterimination of the torque calculation of torsional resistance in wheels is of utmost importance. Moment of resistance to wheel rotation in place The magnitude of the torque required to rotate drive wheels in place, is affected by: 1) load on wheels; 2) coefficient of friction of the tire surface; 3) dimensions and shape of the tire footprint on the surface, as deterimined by the pressure in the tire and its construction; 4) lateral stiffness of the tire; 5) turning radius of drive wheels; 6) angles of inclination of the pin; 7) moment of friction in pins and steering gear mechanism. To achieve the proper torque values of torsional resistance in drive wheels, it is necessary to take into account all these influential factors, as this provides a lower load on the elements in the control system while enabling easier control and reducing the moment of force on the steering wheel. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Mitin Mitin obtained the coefficient  only for one tire so the use of this formula is practically impossible. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Taborek Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Lisov This formula takes into account the radius of the tire, but {{does not take into account}} the pressure and elastic characteristics of tires. Moment of resistance ito rotating drive wheels in place by Litvinov For the calculation by this formula, it is necessary to know the dependence of the tire footprint surface and the load on it. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place by Gough Experimental studies have shown that this term is very acceptable. Dimensions of the executive hydraulic cylinder The control amplifier must provide that the wheels rotate in place when the force of the driver on the steering wheel is not above 160 – 200 N in a complete range of the rotation angles from   for the inner wheel to for the outer wheel. Reactive and centering elements of the hydraulic servo control The control system without a hydraulic servo control must have one very important characteristic which is to develop the ability of the driver to feel the road configuration, especially when going around a curve. In order to achieve this, a reactive element is built into the hydraulic servo control, with a task to absorb rapidly drive wheel oscillations during the reverse inclusion of the hydraulic servo control (from the drive wheels to the steering wheel). Determination of the dimensions of reactive elements and the stiffness of centering springs Taking the results of the static analysis into account, the dependence of force and the torsional resistance in drive wheels can be obtained. From this dependence, P can be found  as a function of. Control calculation The control calculation is performed after selecting general elements of the control system and the amplifier. The control  calculation allows the reduction of amplifier dimensions through the transmission gear mechanism, by selecting the   part onto which amplifier force. is applied. Conclusion The calculation of the control system helps in determining the basic parameters of its elements and assemblies, thus providing the control over the vehicle motion. The main input data in calculating hydraulic servo control is the determination of torsional resistance in drive wheels. In order to achieve proper torque values in torsional resistance, it is necessary to take into account  the given influencing factors since this ensures, on the one hand, lower load on the control system elements and, on the other hand, easier control by reducing the force applied to the steering wheel. ECE Regulation № 79 defines the maximum force that can be applied to the steering wheel, so this paremeter of control systems must be taken into account in vehicle design. The piston stroke and the cylinder length are determined for maximum torque angles of drive wheels, followed vy the determination of the cylinder piston diameter. The tendency to reverse the action of the  hydraulic servo control would violate the basic requirement to the control system which is to get drive <b>wheels</b> <b>back</b> into straight line motion under the influence of the stabilizing moment. In order to prevent reverse action, a reactive and centering element is installed into the hydraulic servo control. Prestressing of central springs provides the return of the steering and drive wheels under the influence of the stabilizing moment without involving the hydraulic servo control. Friction force in the control mechanism must be lower than the force of prestressed central springs. The control computation is performed after the determination of all parameters in order to test the operating ability of the hydraulic servo control and to obtain its characteristics. A properly designed hydraulic servo control has to provide that the summary execution of torque hydraulic servo control and the driver exceeds the moment of resistance throughout the range of angles of rotation of wheels. </p...|$|E
