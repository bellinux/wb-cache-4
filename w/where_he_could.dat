5|$|At 09:00, Washington {{arrived from}} Manhattan. He {{realized}} that he had been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan. His location on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> view the battle.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{his early}} years, Linnæus {{seemed to have a}} liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which {{immediately}} calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> grow plants.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield then {{enrolled}} at Stanford University, where he obtained a master's degree {{in political science}} in 1948. He returned to Salem and Willamette after Stanford and began working as {{an assistant professor in}} political science. During his tenure as professor, he built a political base by sending out messages and speaking at any public forum <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get an invitation.|$|E

60|$|After {{having made}} the above-described {{observations}} from the window, Rollo {{began to think}} {{that he would like to}} go down below to the door, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see what was going on to better advantage.|$|R
50|$|He {{was ready}} to enter the church by 1990, in a poor, east London parish <b>where</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> help ease the {{suffering}} and assist the poverty stricken. He decided to defer a year and backpack around Thailand instead.|$|R
5|$|Hitler {{was very}} fond of Magda Goebbels and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> relax. Magda had a close {{relationship}} with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, after {{retiring}} as party secretary, he acquired {{a patch of}} woodland <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> resume his passion for forestry. For many years he spent his winters in the US state of Florida, but eventually moved back permanently to Norway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the right}} {{rear of the}} French {{position}} was the substantial village of Plancenoit, and at the extreme right, the Bois de Paris wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near La Belle Alliance early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what's {{the matter}} with breakfast?" [...] <b>he</b> asked. From <b>where</b> <b>he</b> stood <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not see Hannah's face, but {{gradually}} his eyes were drawn to her figure. His intuition was not quick, and some moments passed before the rigidity of the pose impressed itself upon him.|$|R
50|$|Then on October 4, 2004 {{he signed}} as a free agent with the New York Knicks, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> hoped <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{continue}} playing in the National Basketball Association. However, on October 27, 2004 he was waived by New York and has not seen game action in the NBA since.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} Joe's heart sank within {{him as he}} {{reviewed}} the situation. <b>Where</b> <b>he</b> was <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not tell, nor <b>could</b> <b>he</b> form any definite plan for rejoining his cousin and old Benson. More than this, {{he was afraid that}} the desperadoes might come up at any minute and pounce upon him.|$|R
5|$|Shahrbaraz {{then moved}} his army to {{northern}} Syria, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily decide to support either Khosrow or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrow's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy {{of some of}} his best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Iran.|$|E
5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not get out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} {{passed into the}} ballroom {{he went back to}} his {{position}} against the wall. They were dancing Number Three; his time of waiting, then, was drawing to a close. From <b>where</b> <b>he</b> stood <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not see the dancers--no use to watch her go round in someone else's arms.|$|R
50|$|Jean C. Vlasto (1814-1869), son of Constantine who {{had been}} killed by the Kurd Roussakis, took refuge with his mother and two {{brothers}} in Nafplio. He studied under Georgios Gennadios, the pioneering Greek educator. Then continuing his studies he went to Syros, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make his career in letters.|$|R
60|$|Whitney {{crept into}} the low-roofed cabin, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> sat on a locker, holding the tackle that lifted the heavy iron centerplate. He {{knew that it would}} be {{desirable}} to heave it up as soon as possible after he got the order. From <b>where</b> <b>he</b> sat <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see nothing outside the boat, but as he looked aft through the hatch he was offered a fascinating picture.|$|R
5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1906, Mahler had been {{director}} of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna {{at the close of}} the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this haven had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No.4, No.5, No.6 and No.7 symphonies, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder ("Songs on the Death of Children").|$|E
5|$|During the First Indochina War, Thảo was a {{communist}} {{officer in the}} Vietminh and helped oversee various operations in the Mekong Delta in the far south, at one point commanding his future enemy Nguyễn Khánh, who briefly served the communist cause. After the French withdrawal and the partition of Vietnam, Thảo stayed {{in the south and}} made a show of renouncing communism. He became part of the military establishment in the anti-communist southern regime and quickly rose through the ranks. Nominally Catholic, Thảo befriended Diệm's elder brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục—the devoutly Roman Catholic Ngô family strongly favored co-religionists and had great trust in Thảo, unaware that he was still loyal to the communists. He went on to serve as the chief of Bến Tre Province, and gained fame after the area—traditionally {{a communist}} stronghold—suddenly became peaceful and prosperous. Vietnamese and US officials, as well as journalists hostile to or supportive of Saigon, misinterpreted this as a testament to Thảo's great ability, and he was promoted to a more powerful position <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> further his sabotage. Thảo and the communists in the local area had simply stopped fighting, so that the communists could quietly recuperate, while Thảo would appear to be very skillful and be given a more important job <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do more damage.|$|E
50|$|Lumix Da Don {{started his}} career in Jinja College School in Jinja {{district}} {{in the eastern part}} of Uganda. While at Jinja College, he participated in rap contests <b>where</b> <b>he</b> proved <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have a place in hip hop. He started out with a group known as SNAG N' O and later formed the Disciples of Apocalypse (DOA).|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke of}} a traveller's house on the Dover Road, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find a clean, plain lodging for the night. I went with him over Westminster Bridge, and parted from him on the Surrey shore. Everything seemed, to my imagination, to be hushed in reverence for him, as he resumed his solitary journey through the snow.|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating from}} college, he {{operated}} {{a movie theater}} and served in the United States Army. After leaving the Army, he headed to Australia in the mid-1950s, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> hoped <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{take advantage of the}} lag in social trends reaching that part of the world. While there, he began a jukebox business that became one of that country's largest.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{after the}} emperor showed Shahrbaraz intercepted letters from Khosrow {{ordering}} the Persian general's death, the latter switched to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily decide to support either Khosrow or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrow's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy {{of some of}} his best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Persia.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the autumn}} of 1935 the Nuremberg Laws revoked this {{privilege}} and instituted a full ban on Jews in the civil service. Hess had to leave his job as a judge at the start of 1936 and was forced out of Düsseldorf after being beaten up by Nazi supporters outside his house {{in the autumn}} of that year. He moved with his family to Wuppertal, then in October 1937 emigrated to Bolzano in the German-speaking South Tyrol region of Italy, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> continue the education in German of his 11-year-old daughter.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Kennedy {{lost his}} {{position}} as Senate Majority Whip when he lost the support of several members and was defeated by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, 31–24. He would later tell Byrd that the defeat was a blessing, as it allowed him {{to focus more on}} issues and committee work, where his best strengths lay and <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> exert influence independently from the Democratic party apparatus, and began a decade as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee.|$|E
60|$|Rowland, from <b>where</b> <b>he</b> stood, <b>could</b> see {{the flower}} she meant--a {{delicate}} plant of radiant hue, which sprouted {{from the top}} of an immense fragment of wall some twenty feet from Christina's place.|$|R
6000|$|He little knew at {{the time}} that the shadow was {{displaying}} his teeth, and loosening in its sheath a long knife or dagger made of bone, which, from the spot <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lay, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have launched with unerring certainty into the heart of any of those who stood before him. It is well for man that he sometimes does not know what might be! ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the same}} aimless and unwitting fashion, he found himself, an hour later, {{sitting on the}} string-piece of the Oakland city wharf and leaning his aching head against a {{friendly}} timber. From <b>where</b> <b>he</b> sat <b>he</b> <b>could</b> look down upon the decks {{of a number of}} small sailing-craft. Quite a crowd of curious idlers had collected to look at them, and Joe found himself growing interested.|$|R
5|$|On December 5, {{following}} {{talk of the}} team's {{future with}} Mark Recchi, the team placed the veteran right wing on waivers. After clearing without being claimed, Recchi {{was assigned to the}} Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the AHL the next day. The following day, before playing a game with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Recchi was placed on re-entry waivers, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> again be claimed by another team. On Saturday, December 8, Recchi was claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers, with whom he joined the following Tuesday. The Penguins and the Thrashers would split the remaining cost of his US$1.75 million contract.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} year, 1938, Imelda's father gave up Manila {{due to his}} declining {{fortunes}} in his law practice and returned to Tacloban <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> support his family with a simpler lifestyle. Imelda has been claimed to have met General Douglas MacArthur when he landed in Palo, Leyte during the Philippines Campaign in 1944. She speaks Tagalog and English, the two official languages of The Philippines, as well as Waray, the regional language of Leyte.|$|E
5|$|While the Allied armies {{continued}} their slow eastward drive between September and November 1944, the Germans {{prepared for a}} counteroffensive. Adolf Hitler, the German leader, believed that by launching an offensive in the West he could force the United States and Great Britain to an early peace, and thereby transfer {{the entirety of the}} Wehrmacht to the Eastern Front, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> bring the Soviet offensive to a standstill and defeat it.|$|E
60|$|Doubts and suspicions which {{distract}} some lovers to imbecility {{only served}} to bring out Jim's great qualities. <b>Where</b> <b>he</b> trusted {{he was the most}} trusting fellow in the world; <b>where</b> <b>he</b> doubted <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be guilty of the slyest strategy. Once suspicious, he became one of those subtle, watchful characters who, without integrity, make good thieves; with a little, good jobbers; with a little more, good diplomatists. Jim was honest, and he considered what to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say you so?" [...] said Montague, {{with a sharp}} {{glance at}} the countenance of the other, <b>where,</b> however, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{perceive}} nothing but placid good humour [...] "that speech sounds marvellously warlike, methinks, {{in the mouth of}} a sandal-wood trader." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Perkenpine was a {{woman whose}} remarks did not depend upon the remarks of others. [...] "Phil Matlack," [...] said she, gazing fixedly at his pipe, [...] "if I had a man I'd let him smoke {{just as much as}} he pleased and just <b>where</b> <b>he</b> pleased. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> smoke afore <b>he</b> got up, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> smoke at his meals, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> smoke after <b>he</b> went to bed, and, if he fancied that sort of thing, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> smoke at family prayers; it wouldn't make no {{difference}} to me, and I wouldn't say a word to him agin' it. If that was his individdlety, I'd say viddle." ...|$|R
