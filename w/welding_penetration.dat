40|$|AbstractHigh-power {{laser beam}} welding in {{industrial}} environment often suffers from process induced contamination of laser focusing optics. Especially exposed to this contamination is the plane protection glass which is positioned directly above the process to protect the expensive lenses from contaminations such as spatter and metal vapor. Locally increased absorption due to con-tamination leads to a temperature rise in the protection glass and a corresponding change of its optical characteristics. This results in a reduced beam quality and a shift of the focus position. Both effects lead to a reduced intensity of radiation on the workpiece causing a lower <b>welding</b> <b>penetration</b> depth. In this article we present laser beam measurements using laser processing optics with protection glasses of different materials and different grades of contamination.

40|$|Gas Metal Arc welding (GMAW) {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{techniques}} used to join structural components together. The major obstacle precluding full closed-loop control of GMAW has been the lack of robust techniques using non-destructive and non-contact sensors capable of operating in high temperature and harsh environments typical of GMAW processes. This research uses laser generated ultrasound and electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) to receive ultrasound. Previous research has focused on ultrasonic shear wave time of flight (TOF) techniques to determine <b>weld</b> <b>penetration</b> depth, a key measure of weld quality. The objective of this research was to use a new technique, frequency modulation of a laser phased array (FMLPA), to determine <b>weld</b> <b>penetration</b> depth. Theoretical background of the FMLPA was developed. An analytical model of the FMLPA was derived and validated through experimentation. The FMLPA was experimentally validated. However, both the FMLPA and shear wave TOF techniques have proven to be impractical for real-time control. These techniques are impractical because the required ultrasonic waves are difficult to acquire due to attenuation and interference from other waves. A new type of wave called the RGLS wave was discovered {{during the course of this}} research. The RGLS wave was used to create a new RGLS TOF method for measuring <b>weld</b> <b>penetration</b> depth. The RGLS TOF method for measuring <b>weld</b> <b>penetration</b> depth has proven to be highly accurate, precise, and repeatable. The RGLS TOF method for measuring <b>weld</b> <b>penetration</b> depth has been demonstrated to work both off-line after welding and real-time during welding.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to obtain insight into the oscillation behaviour of the liquid metal and the arc behaviour during GMA welding. Observations of the weld pool and the arc were undertaken by visual means using a high-speed video and by analysis of the voltage. To deal with the complex phenomena that take place, the research is performed in two steps; firstly, with cold-wire GTA welding on stainless steel AISI 316 L tubes where a filler wire is introduced into the weld pool without being preheated, and secondly with pulsed-current GMA (P-GMA) welding on mild steel S 235 JR plate. The results of the cold-wire GTA experiments showed that for the same penetration state the oscillation modes of the cold-wire and the autogenous GTA weld pools are similar. The partially and the fully penetrated welds oscillate in a sloshy mode and frequencies can be predicted from relatively simple analytical expressions based on weld pool length rather than an equivalent weld pool diameter. When cold-wire GTA welding is performed in the uninterrupted bridging transfer mode the metal transfer does not disturb the voltage signals. The oscillation frequency can be determined from the analysis of voltage signals with the same accuracy {{as in the case of}} autogenous GTA <b>welding.</b> <b>Penetration</b> sensing based on pool oscillation can be applied successfully with this welding mode. The pendant droplet in the case of interrupted metal transfer can oscillate due to the action of the plasma jet. This oscillation may disturb the voltage signals associated with weld pool oscillations. The interaction between the transferred droplets and the weld pool triggers the pool into oscillation. Accordingly the results of voltage analysis to determine the weld pool oscillation frequency can be less accurate than those obtained in the case of autogenous GTA welding or the uninterrupted cold-wire GTA welding. The results of the P-GMA welding experiments showed that the current pulses cannot be used to trigger weld pool oscillation effectively, but the impact of the transferred metal droplets can generate travelling liquid waves on the pool. It is also found that the pendant droplet oscillates in an up-and-down motion. In P-GMA welding the dynamics of the weld pool are not reflected clearly on the voltage. In contrast, the oscillation of the pendant droplet is indicated on the voltage signals. The experiments showed that the arc can be divided into different regions based on its intensities. The extent of the different arc regions changes due to the growth and the oscillation of the droplet, which influences the voltage and leads to a nonlinear relationship between the arc voltage and the arc length. There is strong evidence that the modification of the arc structure is caused by the alteration of metal vapour concentration in the plasma. A proposed conceptual model describes the relationship between the arc voltage and the extent of the different arc regions. The model indicates that the average electric field strength of the bright arc region close to the electrode is higher than that of the normal arc. This result can be of importance for improving welding process control and through the arc sensing, for example for optimising droplet detachment to minimise spatter and reduce fume generation The physical phenomena taking place within the different regions of the arc however require further research. This should include experimental measurements of arc composition and temperature, and the development of a mathematical model of the plasma, including energy exchange due to radiative transport and multi-component diffusion.

A indústria siderúrgica pode contribuir decisivamente neste contexto, disponibilizando no mercado aços de maior resistência mecânica, os quais podem ser utilizados em estruturas mais esbeltas. Os aços com elevados teores de Mn (15 - 30 %) representam um desenvolvimento muito recente de ligas ferrosas puramente austeníticas, que reúnem resistência mecânica elevada e grande ductilidade. Além disso, trata-se de ligas de baixo custo devido à eliminação dos elevados teores de Ni necessários para a estabilização da austenita e ao reduzido tempo de processamento, que dispensa tratamentos térmicos e processamentos termomecânicos controlados. Por outro lado, a redução de peso estrutural no setor automobilístico requer não somente a pesquisa de novos aços, mas também a utilização de componentes híbridos, resultantes, entre outros, da união dos aços austeníticos alto Mn com aços comerciais estruturais de alta resistência e baixa liga (ARBL).

O aporte térmico de soldagem foi variado através do uso de três velocidades de rotação da ferramenta: 300, 400 e 500 rpm, e o avanço foi de 100 mm/min. Dois deslocamentos (offsets) da ferramenta foram investigados: + 1. 0 e + 2. 0 mm em direção ao aço TRIP. Os resultados revelaram um acabamento {{superficial}} satisfatório das juntas soldadas com 300 e 400 rpm. A penetração de soldagem aumentou com a velocidade de rotação da ferramenta e com um maior deslocamento da ferramenta em direção ao aço TRIP devido ao crescimento do aporte térmico. A SFMM produziu em ambos os lados das juntas dissimilares uma microestrutura caracterizada apenas por zona de mistura (ZM) e zona termicamente afetada (ZTA), não sendo observada a formação de zonas termomecanicamente afetadas (ZTMA). Na ZM do aço ARBL, a SFMM produziu uma microestrutura polifásica, contendo misturas de ferrita acicular, bainita e martensita. O lado TRIP da ZM não exibiu sinais de transformação martensítica induzida por deformação e sofreu recristalização dinâmica com a formação de uma austenita refinada em comparação com o metal de base. A junta produzida com menor aporte térmico (300 RPM e Offset + 1) apresentou os maiores picos de dureza na ZM do aço TRIP devido à maior taxa de resfriamento e, consequentemente, a microestrutura mais fina. Apesar dos maiores picos de dureza, a junta produzida com 300 RPM e Offset + 1 apresentou o melhor desempenho no ensaio de tração, atingindo o maior percentual de alongamento a fratura e rompendo no metal de base ARBL. Isso se deve provavelmente à formação de ferrita acicular mais fina na ZM do aço ARBL com microestrutura entrelaçada e de maior tenacidade, se comparado com o metal de base ARBL. The increasing {{scarcity of}} renewable energy resources and their continuously rising costs have required in the last decades a drastic reduction in the energy consumption for the transportation of goods and passengers. The steel industry can decisively contribute in this context by providing the market with steel grades of increased mechanical strength, which {{can be incorporated into}} light-weight structures. Steels with high Mn contents (15 - 30 %) represent a recent development of austenitic ferrous alloys that combine elevated mechanical strength with high ductility. In addition, those steel grades correspond to low cost alloys due to the replacement of the high Ni contents necessary to stabilize the austenite as well as the reduced manufacturing time that does not involve subsequent heat treatments or controlled thermo-mechanical processing. On the other hand, the reduction of structural weight in the automotive sector does not only require the research on novel steels, but also the use of hybrid components that result among others from joining austenitic high-Mn steels to commercial structural high-strength low-alloyed (HSLA) steel grades. In this work, we studied therefore the friction stir weldability of an austenitic high-Mn steel with TRIP (transformation induced plasticity) effect to the thermomechanically processed HSLA XABO 500 steel grade (ThyssenKrupp Steel, yield strength > 460 MPa). High-Mn TRIP steel plates were produced at the EESC-USP with the chemical composition of Fe- 22. 5 % Mn- 0. 4 % C by casting under protective argon atmosphere, followed by homogenization treatment and hot rolling at 1150 °C. The dissimilar TRIP-HSLA joints were produced using 3. 5 mm thick plates. The friction stir welding (FSW) experiments were carried out with a tool made of a PCBN-WRe composite. The heat input was varied by using three tool rotational speeds: 300, 400 and 500 rpm. The welding speed was set to 100 mm/min. Two different tool offsets were investigated: + 1. 0 and + 2. 0 mm towards the high-Mn TRIP steel. The results revealed that a satisfactory surface finishing is achieved for the butt-joints produced with 300 and 400 rpm. The <b>welding</b> <b>penetration</b> increased for higher tool rotational speeds and larger tool offsets towards the TRIP steel because of an increased heat input. FSW produced at both sides of the dissimilar joints a microstructure characterized by only stir zone (SZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ). Thermo-mechanical affected zones (TMAZ) could not be observed. In the SZ of the HSLA steel, FSW produced a multiphase microstructure that contains a mixture of acicular ferrite, bainite and martensite. The TRIP side of the SZ did not exhibit traces of strain induced martensitic transformation and underwent dynamic recrystallization with the formation of a fine-grained austenite in comparison to the base material. The butt-joint produced with the lowest heat input (300 RPM and Offset + 1) developed the highest hardness peaks in the SZ of the TRIP steel because of the increased cooling rate and, consequently, the more refined microstructure. In spite of the hardest zones, the butt-joint produced with 300 RPM and offset + 1 achieved the best performance in the tensile tests by reaching the largest elongation to fracture and having the failure in the HSLA base material. This is likely promoted by the formation of a more refined acicular ferrite in the SZ of the HSLA steel with interpenetrated microstructure and enhanced toughness in comparison to the HSLA base material...|$|E
40|$|Disclosed are {{systems and}} methods that permit both real-time, and off-line, {{measurement}} of <b>weld</b> <b>penetration</b> depth. Exemplary systems and methods comprise an ultrasound source, {{such as a}} pulsed Nd:Yag laser, that simultaneously generates longitudinal and shear waves that radiate adjacent {{one side of a}} weld joining two specimens.
