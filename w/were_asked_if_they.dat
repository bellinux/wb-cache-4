5|$|The Staffords' first radio {{appearance}} was on Los Angeles station KHJ {{as part of}} The Happy Go Lucky Hour when Jo was 16, a role they secured after hopefuls at the audition <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had their own musical accompanist(s). Christine Stafford said that Jo played piano, and the sisters were hired, {{even though she had}} not previously given a public piano performance. The Staffords were subsequently heard on KNX's The Singing Crockett Family of Kentucky, and California Melodies, a network radio show aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System. While Stafford worked on The Jack Oakie Show she met John Huddlestona backing singer on the programmeand they were married in October 1937. The couple divorced in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} of the Territorial Force battalions {{was laid}} down by War Office instructions issued in 1914 and 1915. On joining the Territorial Force men <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now be a first line 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service. In January 1915 these designations were simplified and the battalions called the 1/5th, 2/5th and 3/5th battalions respectively.|$|E

Jim Edwards of NSF supported databases and data-sharing in the area of biodiversity; Koslow proposed the HPG as a model for sharing neuroscientific data, with the new moniker of neuroinformatics.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{procedures}} {{before the}} Hof had an adversarial character. The Hof could act as arbiter {{in cases of}} voluntary arbitration {{at the request of}} parties. Also, in a number of cases there was just one party, without an adversary, who needed a particular judicial or executive action performed. Examples of the latter were the conveyancing of titles of real estate, both voluntary (in case of sale) and involuntary (in case of foreclosure). The Hof acted then as Notary. Another example was the remissiebrief of people who had received a pardon in criminal cases. This remissiebrief was the certificate stating the pardon and this had to be endorsed (interineerd) by the Hof (after a procedure in which the validity of the pardon was tested, and the victims in the crime <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been adequately indemnified by the pardoned criminal).|$|E
25|$|In 2001-2002, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) {{conducted}} the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC).

This time, respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had ever attended a 12-step meeting for an alcohol problem {{in their lifetime}} (the question was not AA-specific). 1441 (3.4%) of respondents answered the question affirmatively.

When pediatric orthopedic surgeons <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would amputate the leg of a child with no foot deformity and just a leg length discrepancy, the answer is almost universally “no”. When pediatric orthopedic surgeons <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> will amputate the leg of a child with a combination of foot deformity and a leg length discrepancy, the answer is frequently “yes”. The logic of this does not follow since for a foot deformity the recommendation is to correct the foot and for a leg length discrepancy the recommendation is to lengthen the leg; therefore, should not the recommendation for a foot deformity with a leg length discrepancy be to correct the foot deformity and lengthen the leg?

25|$|Temporal memory {{consists}} of remembering when a specific memory has occurred. In a study participants {{were placed in}} 4 groups; two control groups either given caffeine or a placebo and two groups that were sleep deprived for 36 hours either given caffeine or a placebo. The task used to measure temporal memory consisted of discriminating between recent and less recent face presentations. A set of twelve unfamiliar faces were presented sequentially every 10 seconds. A self-ordered pointing task was used afterwards for 5 minutes to prevent rehearsal and to keep tired participants occupied. This required them to mark any new items seen (either nouns or abstract shapes) presented on 12 sheets. A second set was presented, followed by another self-ordered pointing task, and then a random sequence of 48 faces either containing previously presented faces or new ones were shown to the participant. They <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> recognized the faces and whether they were from {{the first or second}} set. Results indicate that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but does produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set). Caffeine was found to have a greater effect on the sleep deprived group as compared to the placebo group deprived of sleep but still performed worse than both control groups. Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Brain imaging studies of those sleep deprived found that the greatest reduction in metabolic rate is in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E

According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just {{looked at each other}} like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful."

Behavioral prompts result in higher estimates of volunteer engagement (more are classified as volunteers) and higher levels of commitment (more volunteer hours are captured) ...|$|R
