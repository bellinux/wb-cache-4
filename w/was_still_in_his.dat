5|$|After the war, Brain was {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon. Seeing {{little chance of}} further advancement where he was, Brain {{took the opportunity to}} apply for the position of Operations Manager at Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by Arthur Coles. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Scamper {{sustained}} a cut to his coronet band {{at the beginning}} of the NFR. James recalled how the wound caused her to change Scamper's normal conditioning routine, which cost the pair a few go-round wins; but they still managed to win the world championship title with $96,651 in season earnings. In 1993, James and Scamper qualified for the NFR yet again. James also set her sights on a tenth WPRA World Championship title and recalled how anxious she felt under such pressure. She wanted that win so she could retire Scamper undefeated while he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> prime. That year, the pair won both the NFR and WPRA world championships, securing Scamper's place in barrel racing history.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Evans {{was born}} in Newport, Delaware on September 13, 1755 to Charles and Ann Stalcop Evans. His father was a cordwainer by trade, though he {{purchased}} a large farm {{to the north of}} Newport on the Red Clay Creek and moved his family there when Oliver <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> infancy. Oliver was the fifth of twelve children; he had four sisters and seven brothers. Little else is known of Evans's early life, and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years. The nature and location of his early education has not been preserved, however his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age, both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects. Aged 17, Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon-maker in Newport. An anecdote from the period recalls that his master, an illiterate and extremely frugal man, forbade Evans the use of candles to illuminate his reading in the evenings. Evans found another way by collecting scraps and shavings of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires. The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19. He enlisted in a Delaware militia company, but saw no active service during the war.|$|E

25|$|Before prohibition, Irish gangs {{dominated}} the Bronx and Manhattan, {{but during the}} prohibition era the mobs were increasingly Italian and Jewish and controlled {{by the likes of}} Dutch Schultz, Charles Luciano, Bugsy Siegel and Louis Lepke. Schultz, the son of a barkeeper, built up an empire of speakeasies, clandestine alcohol stills and breweries {{during the early years of}} prohibition. In a tough business, with rival gangs constantly trying to carve out their own territory, Schultz needed ruthless, violent young men with a talent for intimidation and killing. Vincent Coll had all of that in spades and started out as an enforcer for Schultz, when he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mid-teens.|$|E

25|$|Sharing Alexander's upbringing, Hephaestion {{would have}} learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of {{military}} action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander's Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander's other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.|$|E
25|$|Before {{he could}} move, however, Grant {{was faced with}} the problem of {{disengaging}} from Lee's army. Not only were the armies closely situated, Grant's first had to withdraw north over the North Anna, during which it would be very vulnerable to attack. Grant decided on a series of deceptive measures to disguise his intentions. On May 26, he sent a cavalry division under Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson to Little River, probing the western end of the Confederate line, {{while at the same time}} men from the cavalry divisions of Brig. Gens. Alfred T. A. Torbert and David McM. Gregg were sent to the Little Page Bridge and Taylor's Ford on the Pamunkey, 10 miles upriver from Grant's intended crossing points. Lee, who <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tent suffering from the diarrhea that had incapacitated him during the North Anna battle, was fooled by Grant's actions and assumed that the Union general would be moving west for the first time in the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, {{he had a very}} prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E

25|$|The fourth-day of {{the battle}} was noted for the valour shown by Bhima. Bhishma {{commanded}} the Kaurava army to move on the offensive from the outset. While Abhimanyu <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mother's womb, Arjuna had taught Abhimanyu on how to break and enter the chakra vyuha. But, before explaining how to exit the chakra Vyuha, Arjuna was interrupted by Krishna (other story: Abhimanyu's mother falls asleep while Arjuna was explaining her). Thus from birth, Abhimanyu only knew how to enter the Chakra vyuha but didn't know how {{to come out of}} it. When the Kauravas formed the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu entered it but was surrounded and attacked by a number of Kaurava princes. Arjuna joined the fray in aid of Abhimanyu. Bhima appeared on the scene with his mace aloft and started attacking the Kauravas. Duryodhana sent a huge force of elephants at Bhima. When Bhima saw the mass of elephants approaching, he got down from his chariot and attacked them single-handedly with his iron mace. They scattered and stampeded into the Kaurava forces killing many. Duryodhana ordered an all-out attack on Bhima. Bhima withstood all that was thrown at him and attacked Duryodhana's brothers, killing eight of them. Bhima was soon struck by an arrow on the chest and sat down in his chariot dazed.|$|E

500|$|... "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] {{featured}} three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle and {{was written}} for the main antagonist in Lifehouse, Brick.

[...] The closing track, [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained, [...] "a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot of people are going to get hurt". The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an ARP synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used for the finished track.|$|E
