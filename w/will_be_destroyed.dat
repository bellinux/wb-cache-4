5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and {{leaving behind a}} stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed,</b> others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, {{over the course of}} tens of billions of years, {{it is likely that the}} Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of {{documentation}} of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted {{as part of the}} TRC's Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses. On April 4, 2016, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{will destroy}} the highest-priority chemicals, which were {{scheduled}} for removal from Syria by 31 December, {{on board the}} MV Cape Ray in international waters of the Mediterranean, using an U.S. Army Field Deployable Hydrolysis System. The United Kingdom gave the United States £2.5 million of specialist equipment and training to enable the highest-priority chemicals to be processed more quickly. In addition around 150 tonnes of priority two chemicals, toxic material similar to industrial chemical agents, will be transported to the UK {{with the help of}} the British Royal Navy and destroyed there. The remaining stock of priority two chemicals not going to Britain <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> by commercial companies.|$|E
5|$|The game is set {{during a}} fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, {{in which both}} sides use nuclear and {{chemical}} weapons against each other. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.|$|E
5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, {{perched on}} the edge of the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 million years ago. At its current velocity, the {{seamount}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E

5|$|The player's craft has {{a limited}} amount of armour, which is {{depleted}} as the helicopter is hit by enemy fire. Should armour reach zero, the craft <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed,</b> costing the player a life. The player must outmanoeuvre enemies to avoid damage, but can replenish armour by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone. Vehicles have a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted as the level progresses. Should the fuel run out, the vehicle will crash, again costing the player a life. The craft can refuel by collecting fuel barrels. Vehicles also carry limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} which {{was released on}} the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 11, 1995 in Japan and on August 22, 1995 in North America. The game's story follows {{a group of young}} adventurers led by Crono, who are accidentally transported through time and learn that the world <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> in the distant future. Vowing to prevent this disaster, they travel throughout history to discover the means to save the planet. Chrono Trigger was ported to the PlayStation in 1999 as a standalone title in Japan and in 2001 as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation in North America. A third version was released for the Nintendo DS handheld platform on November 20, 2008. It is regarded today {{as one of the greatest}} games ever made.|$|E

Marceline, realizing that Hambo <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> but that she will enable her former protector to see the love of his life for one last time, agrees. The portal is opened just moments after Simon had first put on the ice crown and scared Betty. Simon from the future appears to her, explains the situation, and apologizes. Betty, realizing what has happened jumps through the portal and kisses Simon, only for the portal to close and Simon to collapse.|$|E

5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|Sontheimer {{suggests}} that the cult of Khandoba is at least older than 12th century, which can be determined by references in Jain and Lingayat texts and inscriptions. A 12th-century Jain author Brahmashiva claims that a Jain, who died in battle after a display of his valour, was later named as Mailara. By the 13th century, wide worship of Malhari or Mailara is observed by kings, Brahmins, simple folk and warriors. With the rise of Muslim empire, classical Hindu temples fell into ruin, giving rise to the folk religion such as of Khandoba. Chakradhara remarks, 'by {{the end of the}} Kali Yuga, temples of Vishnu and Shiva <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed,</b> but those of Mailara will stay'. A 1369 AD inscription at Ailoni near Warangal tells an account of Mallari different from Malhari Mahatmya— Shiva helped the epic hero Arjuna kill the demon Malla, thus acquiring the title of Mallari. Mailara was the family deity of Kakatiya dynasty (1083–1323 AD); a text from their rule records the self-torture rituals of Mailara-devotees and describes the deity. Throughout his development, Mailara is looked upon as a lower manifestation of Ishvara (God) by Lingayat and Maharashtrian bhakti saints.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E
