If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a {{comparative study of}} designing digital filter of long duration sequences. Here we have adopted the approach of block filtering scheme “overlap save method ” and compare with the optimized linear convolution scheme for designing digital filter. We have implemented both methods in FPGA Spartan 3 A starter kit, XC 3 S 700 A device. Implementing both algorithms in FPGA hardware platform reveals {{that there is a}} 67 % area reduction and 70. 6 % increase in operating frequency in overlap save method compare to optimize convolution method. In addition the power utilization summary reveals that there is a 24. 24 % increased in the power utilization of overlap save method. Thus the experimental results shows that to design an area optimized, high speed digital filter <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>used</b> overlap save method where as for a power efficient digital filter <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>used</b> optimized linear convolution method.

Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>use</b> it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon.

As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>use</b> it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
