5|$|The last of {{the early}} operas, Vakula the Smith (Op.14), was {{composed}} {{in the second half}} of 1874. The libretto, based on Gogol's Christmas Eve, was to have been set to music by Alexander Serov. With Serov's death, the libretto was opened to a competition <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the winning entry would be premiered by the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere, the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception. After Tchaikovsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote an opera based on the same story, Christmas Eve.|$|E

This, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more reliable than reciprocating engines. By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more reliable than previous models.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 the {{producer}} Basil Dean offered Gielgud the lead role, Lewis Dodd, in a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy's best-selling novel, The Constant Nymph. Before rehearsals began Dean {{found that a}} bigger star than Gielgud was available, namely Coward, to whom he gave the part. Gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role, but Dean, a notorious bully, was a powerful force in British theatre. Intimidated, Gielgud accepted the position of understudy, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{that he would take}} over the lead from Coward when the latter, who disliked playing in long runs, left. In the event Coward, who had been overworking, suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night, and Gielgud played the lead {{for the rest of the}} run. The play ran for nearly a year in London and then went on tour.|$|E

As AIB depends {{to a significant}} extent on the international financial markets for liquidity due to an insufficient deposit base, this has impacted the bank severely.

She made her final appearance at the Coliseum Theatre, London, at the age of 56. When she gave up the stage, {{one of the main reasons}} she gave was that her husband wanted to become an MP, and her profession was not really respectable enough for such a milieu; arguably, she was too well known and outshone him as a public figure, which was a concern. For the rest of her life she lived as Lady de Frece, moving to Monte Carlo with her husband upon his retirement from politics.|$|E

On January 10, 1842 the first lecture was given at the Diocesan Theological Institute in Cobourg. In 1852, teaching was transferred to Toronto in the new Faculty of Divinity at Trinity College. Trinity College absorbed the Diocesan Theological Institute in Cobourg in 1852.|$|E

Eight songs from the original score were discarded as they were not considered to advance the film's plot. One of these, [...] "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan", was also used in Follow the Fleet (1936). All five songs eventually selected became major hits and, in the September 28, 1935 broadcast of Your Hit Parade, all five featured in the top fifteen songs selected for that week.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, the Soviet Union {{had once}} been ready to support an control {{commission}} {{under the aegis of}} the UN, Khrushchev explained, but it could not longer do so given perceived bias in recent UN action in the Congo. Instead, Khrushchev reiterated the troika proposal. Furthermore, Khrushchev insisted that the test ban be considered in the context of [...] "general and complete disarmament," [...] arguing that a test ban on its own was unimportant; Kennedy said the US could only agree <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that a disarmament agreement would be reached quickly (the Vienna demands thus amounted to a reversal of both sides' earlier positions). Kennedy also disagreed that a test ban was itself insignificant; the world could expect many more countries in the coming years to cross the nuclear threshold without a test ban. Ultimately, the two leaders left Vienna without clear progress on the subject. The Soviet Union would drop the general-disarmament demand in November 1961.|$|E

Two singles were then issued on the Brother imprint: [...] "Heroes and Villains" [...] and [...] "Gettin' Hungry". The former peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Capitol A director Karl Engemann began circulating a memo, dated July 25, 1967, in which Smiley Smile {{was referred to as}} a [...] "cartoon" [...] stopgap for Smile. The memo also discussed conversations between him and Wilson pertaining to the release of a 10-track Smile album, which would not have included the songs [...] "Heroes and Villains" [...] or [...] "Vegetables". This never came to fruition and, instead, the group embarked on a tour of Hawaii in August. Bruce Johnston, who was absent for most of the recording sessions, did not accompany the group, although Brian did. Their performances were limited to two shows at an auditorium in Honolulu, which were filmed and recorded with the intention of releasing a live album, Lei'd in Hawaii. On stage, the band continued to exhibit a more minimal sound.|$|E

In addition, Pickford's compensation was half of a film's profits, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of $1,040,000 (US$ [...] in [...] ). Occasionally, she played a child, in films such as The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Daddy-Long-Legs (1919) and Pollyanna (1920).

They launched organizing campaigns, adopted a new constitution, and began transformation from a social club into an active labor union. NAIRE received its charter as a federal employee union in 1967. In 1973, the union expanded again to include members throughout the Treasury Department and the organization's name was updated to the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU); and the new NTEU began its drive to gain representation of the 13,000 U.S. Customs Service employees who were represented by either the National Customs Service Association (NCSA) or AFGE (which was [...] NCSA units).

2500|$|After {{the slaves}} were freed, the {{plantation}} owners were desperate for {{new sources of}} labour. In 1839 the British government began a programme of recruiting Indian labourers in Calcutta {{to be sent to}} Trinidad and British Guiana, now Guyana.

[...] The mostly Hindu and Muslim labourers were compelled to work 7 and a half hours a day, six days a week for 3 years, receiving about 13 cents a day for their work. At first, half of the recruits were women but, in 1840, the proportion was reduced to a third of the number of men. In 1844, the period of indenture was extended to five years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that, if they wished, they would get a free passage {{home at the end of}} their service. In 1853 the law was again amended to allow the indentured labourers to re-indenture themselves for a second five-year term or, if they wished, to commute any portion of their contract by repayment of a proportionate part of their indenture fee.|$|E
