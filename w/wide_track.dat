5|$|A {{number of}} highway {{designation}} and routing {{changes in the}} Pontiac were made when US10 was shifted out of downtown to replace M-58 along Telegraph Road west of downtown {{by the middle of}} 1961. Before the change, US10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake roads. After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Two years later, I-75 was completed to the east of Pontiac, and the M-24 bypass of the city was turned over to local control. The former Bus. M-24 through downtown was renumbered BL I-75 along with a connection along Square Lake Road out to the freeway. The next year, the streets downtown Pontiac were reconfigured and a loop called <b>Wide</b> <b>Track</b> Drive was created to route traffic around the downtown area. The former routing of BL I-75 on Perry Street in the downtown core was replaced by routing the business loops on <b>Wide</b> <b>Track</b> Drive. Then in 1966, an interchange was built to replace the intersection at Opdyke Road and Square Lake Road.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{received}} {{permission from}} the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus. US10 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US24, including the segment concurrent with BL I-75. <b>Wide</b> <b>Track</b> Drive through downtown was renamed as the Woodward Avenue Loop in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Viking raids {{took place}} for {{instance}} in 987 and 997 at Watchet and the Battle of Cynwit. King Alfred was driven to seek refuge from the Danes at Athelney before defeating them at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, usually considered to be near Edington, Wiltshire, but possibly the village of Edington in Somerset. Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or Herepath, so his army could cover Viking movements at sea. The Herepath has a characteristic form which is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation 20m <b>wide</b> <b>track</b> between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments. The Herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich, past Cannington hill fort to Over Stowey, where it climbed the Quantocks {{along the line of}} the current Stowey road, to Crowcombe Park Gate. Then it went south along the ridge, to Triscombe Stone. One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill, back to Alfred's base at Athelney. The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe, then along the avenue to Red Post Cross, and west to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor. A peace treaty with the Danes was signed at Wedmore and the Danish king Guthrum the Old was baptised at Aller. Burhs (fortified places) had been set up by 919, such as Lyng. The Alfred Jewel, an object about 2.5inch long, made of filigree gold, cloisonn√©-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton. Believed to have been owned by Alfred the Great it is thought to have been the handle for a pointer that would have fit into the hole at its base and been used while reading a book.|$|E

50|$|Most often bulldozers {{are large}} and {{powerful}} tracked heavy equipment. The tracks give them excellent ground holding capability and mobility through very rough terrain. <b>Wide</b> <b>tracks</b> help distribute the bulldozer's weight over a large area (decreasing ground pressure), thus preventing it from sinking in sandy or muddy ground. Extra <b>wide</b> <b>tracks</b> are known as swamp tracks or LGP (low ground pressure) tracks. Bulldozers have transmission systems designed {{to take advantage of}} the track system and provide excellent tractive force.|$|R
25|$|The chassis {{was built}} with a two-metre <b>wide</b> <b>track,</b> using under-body {{aerodynamics}} {{to create the}} needed conditions for increased overtaking opportunities. The cars were subjected to the lengthy FIA safety tests during development stages in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The C.180 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} undercarriage.

25|$|A unique Astre {{package was}} offered in 1975. Dubbed the 'Lil <b>Wide</b> <b>Track,</b> {{it was the}} {{creation}} of Jerry Juska of Dymar to help with lackluster Astre sales. Juska took his ideas to Dave Landrith of Motortown Corporation specializing in custom auto work. The package includes a front air dam, rear spoiler, appliance wire mag rims, window louvers, a chrome exhaust tip, and bright stripe decals for the hood, body sides, rear spoiler, door handles, and wheel centers. They assembled a couple of cars in Jan. and Feb. 1975 and took pictures to local Detroit dealers where the package gained acceptance. It added a little over $400 to the price of the Astre but dealers felt the difference in looks was worth the price. Production was later switched from an old warehouse in suburban Detroit to a factory beside the Lordstown Assembly Vega/Astre plant. An estimated 3,000 Lil <b>Wide</b> <b>Track</b> Astres were ordered by dealerships. The package components were later offered as a dealer installed kit.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wide</b> <b>track</b> and a {{steerable}} nosewheel {{made the}} aircraft {{easy to handle}} on the ground, and the short landing gear avoided the need for access ladders and service stands. The aircraft {{was designed to be}} simple to maintain, with more than 100 access panels and doors. An experienced ground crew could change an engine in about half an hour.|$|E
25|$|The Brikken had a Farman style fixed undercarriage, {{with two}} wheels {{on each side}} on short axles {{attached}} {{at right angles to}} skids, upturned at the front. The front end of each skid was mounted on a single raked strut to the wing and the rear by a transverse V-pair with its upper ends below the aft inner and second interplane struts, further braced with wires, resulting in a <b>wide</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

50|$|One of {{the finest}} films ever made, the movie has some {{fascinating}} stunt scenes, involving Kalaripayattu. With <b>wide</b> <b>tracking</b> photography, great shots of the Malenadu forests and excellent detailing, Ondanondu Kaladalli is an epic masterpiece.|$|R
25|$|Development {{of speed}} {{cushions}} has {{focused primarily on}} the European context. Consumer vehicles in Europe are typically smaller than American vehicles. This is to accommodate smaller demand for passengers and to better suit narrower road widths. European vehicles typically have a narrower track width than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a <b>wide</b> <b>track</b> width, {{and the difference between}} them makes speed cushions more applicable.|$|E
25|$|The G.11E's {{fuselage}} has a tapered, oval section. The forward part is a {{light alloy}} monocoque containing the well glazed cockpit, accessed by two sliding doors. The rear fuselage is a steel tube structure, covered in fabric, bearing a tall T-tail with a moving, one-piece tailplane which corrected the cyclic pitch via the control column to prevent once per revolution pitch oscillations. A <b>wide</b> <b>track</b> undercarriage has main wheels mounted on horizontal V-struts from the fuselage bottom and with a single bracing strut to the mid-fuselage on each side.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, <b>wide</b> <b>track</b> parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E

50|$|The {{submarine}} {{performed well}} in the water, but was considered underpowered on land. More powerful 250 hp diesel engines were planned for later models, in addition to <b>wider</b> <b>tracks</b> to spread the load and decrease ground pressure.|$|R
25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. One method of learning to ski for competitors with cerebral palsy in this classification is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift.

25|$|The Heinkel He 112, {{based on}} a {{scaled-down}} Blitz, was the favourite of the Luftwaffe leaders. Compared with the Bf 109, it was also cheaper. Positive aspects of the He 112 included the <b>wide</b> <b>track</b> and robustness of the undercarriage (this opened outwards from mid wing, {{as opposed to the}} 109s which opened from the wing root), considerably better visibility from the cockpit, and a lower wing loading that made for easier landings. In addition, the V4 had a single-piece, clear-view, sliding cockpit canopy and a more powerful Jumo 210Da engine with a modified exhaust system. However, the He 112 was also structurally complicated, being 18% heavier than the Bf 109, and {{it soon became clear that}} the thick wing, which spanned 12.6m (41ft 4in) with an area of 23.2m2 (249.7ft2) on the first prototype (V1), was a disadvantage for a light fighter, decreasing the aircraft's rate of roll and manoeuvrability. As a result, the He 112 V4 which was used for the trials had new wings, spanning 11.5m (37ft 8.75in) with an area of 21.6m2 (232.5ft2). However, the improvements had not been fully tested and the He 112 V4 could not be demonstrated in accordance with the rules laid down by the Acceptance Commission, placing it at a distinct disadvantage.|$|E
500|$|There was a 4 feet (1.2 metre) <b>wide</b> <b>track</b> {{leading to}} the circle from the north, with Burl opining that [...] "if this had been an avenue {{it was a very}} poor one". Three stake-holes were found at the western side of the circle, where it was joined by the track.|$|E
50|$|From 1933 to 1939 429 {{civilian}} Ro {{trucks were}} built. This version differed mechanically {{from the military}} type mainly for its <b>wider</b> <b>tracks</b> front and rear, as well for {{the availability of a}} longer 4250 mm wheelbase alongside the normal version.|$|R
50|$|The C 63 coupe also {{benefits}} from a <b>wider</b> <b>track,</b> {{as evidenced by}} the pumped wheel arches. The wheels are also bigger on the Mercedes-AMG model with 19 inches in diameter. The C-Class Coupe comes with 18-in wheels as standard.|$|R
50|$|It {{also served}} {{as the basis for}} the Traxxas Cat. Refined with hobby-grade {{electronics}} including an electronic speed control and a revised front end with a <b>wider</b> <b>track,</b> the Cat became Traxxas' - and the industry's - first ready-to-run hobby-grade model.|$|R
