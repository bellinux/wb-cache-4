5000|$|Unlike Caribbean cigars, where {{a binder}} is rolled around the filler tobacco before the <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco</b> covers it over, the Toscano cigar {{is made by}} rolling the filler tobacco with only the <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco</b> (without any binder). The {{production}} of cigars then continues on two lines: production by hand for high quality and limited edition cigars, and production by machine. In the production by hand, a cigar roller known as [...] "sigaraia" [...] produces up to 520 cigars per day. After rolling, the cigars are air-dried in an aging chamber. Depending on the duration of maturation, different qualities result. The cigars are placed in ventilated cells with controlled humidity levels. The aging period varies {{depending on the type}} of cigar. Some of the high-quality Toscano cigars are hand-rolled such as the Toscano Il Moro, Toscano Il Presidente, Toscano Originale.|$|E
50|$|In 1828, Governor William P. Duval {{introduced}} Cuban tobacco to {{the territory}} of Florida. As a result, the culture of shade-grown cigar <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco</b> was a dominant factor {{in the social and}} economic development of Gadsden County. Tobacco is a native plant of the western hemisphere. Early European explorers discovered Native Americans growing the plant when they set foot on their soil.|$|E

50|$|Colonel Henry DuVal, {{president}} of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, shipped samples of Gadsden County tobacco to New York for leaf dealers and cigar manufacturers to inspect. Soon representatives of several companies came down from New York to purchase land for growing tobacco. There was such an influx of land purchases {{that a number of}} packing houses arose. This continued until 1970 when tobacco companies came under fire and demand diminished. Around 1970, growing tobacco declined substantially in Gadsden. The development of a homogenized cigar wrapper, the ever-increasing cost of production, the subsidizing of the tobacco culture in Central America by the U.S. government, and the increasing, negative legal climate against the tobacco industry have added to the demise of Gadsden's future in tobacco. The last crop of shade-grown cigar <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco</b> was grown in 1977.|$|E
5000|$|Blunts {{originally}} {{got their}} name from their [...] "broad or rounded tip", and were named as such in the 19th century to differentiate them from other cigars with a tapered, pointed tip. Blunts are a specific size cigar {{that have been}} so popular as to have been once sold in specific vending machines. The original blunt cigar was manufactured in Philadelphia out of a single leaf outer tobacco wrapper. At the time {{this was the only}} cigar wrapped in one continuous leaf, other cigars used pieces of leaves for their outer <b>wrapper.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> leaves naturally taper at the ends. Since this cigar was rolled in one leaf the end would taper and had a round appearance (thus leading to the Blunt name). Due to the popularity of this style of cigar many other Blunts were launched into the marketplace. Brands of blunts include: Phillies, Dutch Masters, Backwoods, White Owl, Altadis marketing [...] "Antonio Y Cleopatra", [...] "El Producto", and [...] "Tampa Nugget" [...] brands, Swedish Match marketing [...] "Game" [...] and [...] "Garcia Y Vega" [...] brands, and Swisher Sweets marketing [...] "King Edward", [...] "Optimo", and Pom Pom brands. These types of cigars are commonly sold in convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and drugstores, in contrast to premium cigars, which are sold in cigar shops. Blunts burn quickly like cigarettes, and some can be smoked in about five minutes, whereas a premium cigar takes an hour or so to burn. Unlike premium cigars, blunts are either already cut or have a hole in the mouth end for the smoke to go through, and so they {{do not need to be}} cut at the mouth end. Blunts are also significantly cheaper than premium cigars.|$|E
40|$|Prompt tillage after crop harvest was {{investigated}} {{as a cultural}} control for the tobacco cyst nematode, Globodera tabacum tabacum, on stalk-cut broadleaf cigar <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Stalk stumps and roots remaining after harvest were destroyed by tilling immediately or from 2 to 6 wk after harvest in field experiments over 4 yr. Cyst nematode Pf/Pi ratios ranged from 0. 65 to 1. 62 when plants were tilled immediately after harvest and 1. 13 to 5. 88 when tillage was delayed. Nematode population development was monitored by inoculating plants in pots placed in fields with J 2 in eggs and sampling over time (8 to 18 wk). Three generations per year were observed, and G. t. tabacum generation time was as short as 6 wk for each generation. Destroying stalks and root systems remaining after harvesting stalk-cut broadleaf cigar <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco</b> removes the host to preclude development of nematodes {{at the end of}} the second and entire third generation. Early tillage resulted in consistently lower tobacco cyst nematode populations than allowing viable roots to remain in fields for an additional 8 to 18 wk. This management tactic reduces the need for nematicide application to slow nematode population increases over time and can reduce losses due to infection by G. t. tabacum...|$|E

The text reads as : 2 ̆ 2 Cigar <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco</b> was grown only in a small area of Georgia, Florida and the Connecticut River Valley from the 1840 s to 1975. During the 1890 s, wooden arbors began {{to be used to}} make the leaves lighter and thinner. Later, cheese cloth tents were used to filter {{sunlight}} and keep insects out. After World War II, production was mechanized, but the cultivation of tobacco still remained one of the most labor intensive crops grow.

40|$|Field microplot {{experiments}} were conducted from 1995 to 1998 {{to determine the}} relationship between fresh shoot weight of stalk-cut broadleaf and shade-grown cigar <b>wrapper</b> <b>tobacco</b> types (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and initial density of Globodera tabacum tabacum second stage juveniles (J 2) per cm³ soil. Total shoot weight was negatively correlated with initial nematode densities of 12. 3 to 747. 3 J 2 /cm³ soil (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 70 for broadleaf and shade-grown tobacco, respectively). Nonlinear damage functions were used to relate initial G. t. tabacum densities to shoot weight. The models described shoot weight losses of less than 14 % or 39 % for broadleaf and shade tobacco, respectively, at G. t. tabacum densities below 50 J 2 /cm³ soil. Total shoot weights were reduced by 40 % and 60 % of uninfested plots as preplant nematode densities approached maximum levels (> 600 J 2 /cm³ soil) for broadleaf and shade tobacco, respectively. Globodera t. tabacum population increase over a growing season was described by a linear relation on a log/log plot (R² = 0. 07 and 0. 61 for broadleaf and shade, respectively). These experiments demonstrate that G. t. tabacum can directly reduce shoot weight of stalk-cut broadleaf tobacco. Broadleaf is more tolerant to nematode infection than shade tobacco, as shade tobacco shoot weight reductions were greater at the same initial nematode densities in the same years...|$|E
5000|$|By 1700, tobacco {{was being}} {{exported}} via the Connecticut River to European ports. The use of Connecticut Valley tobacco as a cigar wrapper leaf {{began in the}} 1820s.

50|$|A little cigar is a cigar that is {{the same}} size as a cigarette—often {{featuring}} a filter—however, it still retains its identity as a cigar because it is wrapped in a tobacco leaf, or more often a paper <b>wrapper</b> made of <b>tobacco</b> pulp, reconstituted tobacco or homogenized tobacco. Flavored little cigars are available on the market as well. Flavored little cigars have been steadily increasing in popularity among cigar smokers.

40|$|A cigar is {{a product}} made of tobacco leaves or parts of leaves rolled {{together}} {{and covered with a}} binder (a firm tobacco leaf which holds the filler together and gives the cigar its shape) and an outer wrapper made of natural or reconstituted tobacco. The term includes cheroots and cigarillos (small or miniature cigars). Some small cigars are similar in size to a cigarette and may include a filter. Those with a filter usually have a <b>wrapper</b> of processed <b>tobacco</b> which looks similar to brown paper, while small cigars without a filter are generally wrapped in tobacco leaf. 1, 2 Prevalence In Great Britain there has been a steady decline in pipe and cigar smoking among men since the 1970 s. In 2007, just 2 % of men smoked at least one cigar a month, compared with 34 % in 1974. Very few women have ever smoked cigars and since 1978 the numbers have been scarcely measurable.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{fertilizers}} have {{a decisive}} {{influence on the}} yield and quality of tobacco. Yield, percentage of plant N, wrapper leaf quality, and nicotine content are all important quality characteristics in tobacco growing. This work {{is an attempt to}} provide a tool for optimizing mineral N nutrition for Cuban cigar tobacco, using a strategy that links N supply with leaf N concentration and wrapper yield. Similar approaches developed worldwide have mainly involved Virginia and Burley tobacco types but not Cuban cigar tobacco. The objective of the current work is to identify the effects of fertilizer N levels and timing of application on each of the mentioned quality factors for shade grown Cuban cigar tobacco. Another purpose is to explore the usefulness of a quick method of assessing the N status of plants based on measuring leaf transmission at two different wavelengths (650 and 940 nm). The experiments were done in the main tobacco growing area of Cuba (Vueltabajo). In each experiment, nine separate treatments were used covering different levels and times of fertilizer N application. The same experiment was carried out in three different years (2005 - 2006, 2006 - 2007, 2007 - 2008) but as the results were similar only one set of data is described (2006 - 2007). The patterns of response to N fertilizer of all four quality measurements, including yield and wrapper leaf quality, were similar in the different replications of the experiments. The optimal fertilizer level was 140 - 190 kg N/ha (40 % applied on days 8 - 10 after transplanting and 60 % on days 18 - 20 after transplanting). The optimal N concentration of leaves taken at the central foliar level of the middle stalk position was 4. 3 - 4. 7 % at harvest time. Leaf transmission measurements by means of the SPAD- 502 Chlorophyll Meter {{in the early stages of}} growth were correlated with leaf chlorophyll and N concentration and provide an excellent guide for predicting Cuban cigar <b>tobacco</b> <b>wrapper</b> leaf yield...|$|R
