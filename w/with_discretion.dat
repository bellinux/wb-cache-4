Though she participated fully {{in the life of}} James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself <b>with</b> <b>discretion</b> and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{order of}} the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an {{individual}} be detained {{for up to two}} years. This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time. The Minister is empowered <b>with</b> <b>discretion</b> to suspend a detention order, but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time, which reactivates the detention order. Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister. If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees, the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release. The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens. When a detention order is extended, the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension.|$|E

The Anglo-French delegation, which included Harry Smith Parkes and Henry Loch, were taken prisoner by the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen during the negotiations. Sengge Rinchen then led his elite Mongol cavalry to attack the Anglo-French forces at the Battle of Baliqiao but was defeated. The Xianfeng Emperor recalled Zaiyuan and Muyin from Tongzhou, fled with most of his imperial court to Rehe Province, and appointed Prince Gong as an Imperial Commissioner <b>with</b> <b>Discretion</b> and Full Authority (欽差便宜行事全權大臣).|$|E
25|$|In general, Finland was {{stationed}} in a strategic and neutral position between the Cold War blocks and both sides engaged in intensive intelligence activities in Finland. Mostly, Finland was an interest to the superpowers as a buffer zone and as an overflight and military transit route. During the first decades, the main tasks of Supo were to monitor communists, such as the Communist Party of Finland and home Russians, and prevent illegal intelligence, especially KGB and GRU espionage. The Service had to work <b>with</b> <b>discretion</b> and caution, balancing between independence and appeasement, due to finlandization. At the same time, Supo had close connections with the CIA—although the Service was wary of recording it on paper.|$|E

In Călinescu's view, this chapter in Creangă's literature created another {{link between the}} Moldavian writer and the Renaissance tradition of Rabelais: [...] "All Rabelaisians have penetrated deeply {{into the realm of}} vulgarity." [...] The taste for titillating accounts was also cultivated by Junimea members, who discreetly signaled their wish to hear more explicit content by asking Creangă to recount stories from [...] "the wide street". A product of this context, Moș Nichifor Coțcariul itself is said to have had at least one sexually explicit variant, circulated orally.|$|E
500|$|Ratnakaravarni of Mudabidri (1557), court poet at Karkala {{under the}} {{patronage}} of Bhairasa Wodeyar, {{is famous for}} successfully integrating an element of worldly pleasure into asceticism and for treating the topic of eros <b>with</b> <b>discretion</b> in a religious epic, his magnum opus the Bharatadesa Vaibhava. One {{of the most popular}} poets of Kannada literature, Ratnakaravarni's writings were popular across religions and sects. He appears to have had tense relationships with both court and monastery, however, owing to writings on erotics and the science of pleasure, rather than purely spiritual poetry. A radical and sensitive poet, he once claimed that spiritual meditation [...] "was boring". Tradition has it that Ratnakaravarni converted to Veerashaivism when his Bharatadesa Vaibhava (also called Bharatesvara Charite) was initially scorned, later to return to the Jain fold and pen other important writings. The Bharatadesa Vaibhava is written in eighty cantos and includes 10,000 verses. His other important writings include the 2,000 spiritual songs called Annagalapada ("Songs of the Brothers") and the three shatakas: the Ratnakara sataka, the Aparajitesvara shataka (a discourse on Jain morals, renunciation and philosophy) and the Trilokya shataka, an account of the universe as seen by Jains, consisting of heaven, hell and the intermediate worlds.|$|E
500|$|Literary {{developments}} {{during the}} Hoysala period had a marked influence on Kannada {{literature in the}} centuries to follow. These developments popularised folk metres which shifted the emphasis towards desi (native or folk) forms of literature. With the waning of Jain literary output, competition between the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava writers came to the fore. The Veerashaiva writer Chamarasa (author of Prabhulingalile, 1425) and his Vaishnava competitor Kumaravyasa (Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari, 1450) popularised the shatpadi metric tradition initiated by Hoysala poet Raghavanka, {{in the court of}} Vijayanagara King Deva Raya II. Lakshmisa, the 16th–17th century writer of epic poems, continued the tradition in the [...] Jaimini Bharata, a work that has remained popular even in the modern period. The tripadi metre, one of the oldest in the Kannada language (Kappe Arabhatta inscription of 700), which was used by Akka Mahadevi (Yoganna trividhi, 1160), was popularised in the 16th century by the mendicant poet Sarvajna. Even Jain writers, who had dominated courtly literature throughout the classical period with their Sanskritic champu style, began to use native metres. Among them, Ratnakaravarni is famous for successfully integrating an element of worldly pleasure into asceticism and for treating the topic of eroticism <b>with</b> <b>discretion</b> in a religious epic written in the native sangatya metre (a metre initiated by Hoysala poet Sisumayana), his magnum opus, the Bharatadesa Vaibhava (c.1557).|$|E

We show experimentally that screening for work attitude and labor market competition are causal determinants of {{the viability of}} high-performance work systems, and we identify the complementarities between discretion, rent-sharing, and screening that render them profitable. Two fundamentally distinct job designs emerge endogenously in our experiments: “bad” jobs <b>with</b> low <b>discretion,</b> low wages, and little rent-sharing and “good” jobs <b>with</b> high <b>discretion,</b> high wages, and substantial rent-sharing. Good jobs are profitable only if employees can be screened, and labor market competition fosters their dissemination...|$|R
500|$|In April 1940 Mitford {{suffered}} {{her second}} miscarriage. Shortly afterwards Rodd, {{who had been}} commissioned into the Welsh Guards, departed overseas. Alone in London, Mitford moved to the family's Rutland Gate house where she remained during the London blitz. The main house had been requisitioned to provide a refuge for Jewish families evacuated from the bombed areas of the East End. Mitford {{spent much of her}} time looking after these families, [...] "so hard-working, clean and grateful". A brief affair with a [...] Free French officer, André Roy, resulted in a third pregnancy. Mitford again miscarried, with complications that led, in November 1941, to a hysterectomy. After convalescence, at a loose end, she began working as an assistant at the Heywood Hill bookshop in Curzon Street. The shop became the centre of Mitford's daily activities, and was a favoured meeting place for London's literati. In September 1942 she met Gaston Palewski, a French colonel attached to General Charles de Gaulle's London staff. She found him fascinating, and he became the love of her life—though her feelings were never fully reciprocated—and an inspiration for much of her future writing. For the sake of Mitford's reputation the affair was pursued <b>with</b> <b>discretion,</b> before Palewski left for Algeria in May 1943. Thereafter the relationship was conducted mainly by letters and occasional phone calls, since Palewski was only intermittently in England {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E

2500|$|The force did not {{routinely}} carry firearms, although Sir Robert Peel authorised the Commissioner {{to purchase}} fifty flintlock pocket pistols {{for use in}} exceptional circumstances, such as those which involved the use of firearms. Later, the obsolete flintlocks were decommissioned from service, superseded by early revolvers. At the time, burglary (or [...] "house breaking" [...] {{as it was then}} called) was a common problem for police. [...] "House breakers" [...] were usually armed. It was then also legal (under the Bill of Rights 1689) for members of the public who were Protestants, as most were, to own and use firearms. Following the deaths of officers by firearms on the outer districts of the metropolis, and public debate on arming the force, the Commissioner applied to Robert Peel for authorisation to supply officers on the outer districts with revolvers. The authorisation was issued on the condition that revolvers would only be issued if, in the opinion of the senior officer, the officer could be trusted to use it safely and <b>with</b> <b>discretion.</b> From then, officers could be armed.
