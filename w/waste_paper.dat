5|$|The Medway valley {{has long}} been {{associated}} with the newsprint industry, but in February 2015 it was confirmed that the last major paper mill in the parish, Aylesford Newsprint, was to close with the loss of 233 jobs. Ditton's connection with the industry goes back to 1922 when the first factory was built by Reed International {{on the banks of the}} river Medway. Reed International were a major paper manufacturer which, at its height, had in the region of 1,500 employees. The business was seriously hampered by the advent of World War II, which caused a shortage of pulp to make newspapers and led to a different material, <b>waste</b> <b>paper,</b> being used in its place. <b>Waste</b> <b>paper</b> was then replaced by recycled fibre, which was fully utilised in the process of producing newsprint. The 60-acre Newsprint plant belonged to SCA, paper manufacturers from Sweden, in partnership with Mondi, and £250 million was invested in developing the site. Aylesford Newsprint was one of the world's leading manufacturers of newsprint, recycling around 500,000 tonnes of material to produce some 400,000 tonnes of final product. Media organisations in Europe, America and the Far East relied on the recycled newsprint from the plant for their publications. Ditton stream was a vital water supply for the processes carried out in the plant.|$|E
40|$|Producing {{bioethanol}} {{from various}} wastes is a promising strategy to meet {{part of the}} transport energy demand and also to contribute to <b>waste</b> management. <b>Waste</b> <b>papers</b> (newspaper, office paper, magazines and cardboard in this work) with their 50 % to 70 % carbohydrate content are potential raw materials for bioethanol production. From both technical and economic aspects, bioethanol production processes for various <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> were evaluated in this study. High-solids loading (15 % w/w) enzymatic hydrolyses using two enzyme alternatives (Celluclast 1. 5 L supplemented with Novozyme 188 and Cellic Ctec 1) achieved glucan conversion efficiencies from <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> of 50 % to 76 %. Base case process models developed using these experimental data were then applied to an economic analysis to determine the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for bioethanol derived from the <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> using a discounted cash flow method. The effects of several processing parameters: alternative product recovery processes, enzyme loading, enzymatic hydrolysis residence time and two enzyme alternatives on the MESP are explored. Bioethanol produced from cardboard (using Cellic Ctec 1) resulted in the lowest MESP. Two state-of-the-art technologies, dilute acid pre-treatment on office paper and oxidative lime pre-treatment on newspaper, were also investigated. This study suggests that bioethanol production from <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> is feasible and profitable from both technical and economic points of view. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012...|$|R

Hume employed William Ruxton Davison, who was brought to notice by Dr. George King, as a curator for his personal bird collection. Hume trained Davison and sent him out annually on collection trips to various parts of India as he himself was held up with official responsibilities. In 1883 Hume returned {{from a trip to}} find that many pages of the manuscripts that he had maintained over the years had been stolen and sold off as <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> by a servant. Hume was completely devastated and he began to lose interest in ornithology due to this theft and a landslip, caused by heavy rains in Simla, which had damaged his museum and many of the specimens. He wrote to the British Museum wishing to donate his collection on certain conditions. One of the conditions was that the collection was to be examined by Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe and personally packed by him, apart from raising Dr. Sharpe's rank and salary due to the additional burden on his work caused by his collection. The British Museum was unable to heed his many conditions. It was only in 1885 after the destruction of nearly 20000 specimens, that alarm bells were raised by Dr. Sharpe and the museum authorities let him visit India to supervise the transfer of the specimens to the British Museum.|$|E
