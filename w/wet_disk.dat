30|$|Mechanical {{grinding}} (milling) is {{used for}} reducing the crystallinity of cellulose. It mostly includes chipping, grinding, and/or milling techniques. Chipping can reduce the biomass size to 10 – 30  mm only while grinding and milling can reduce the particle size up to 0.2  mm. However, studies found that further reduction of biomass particle below 0.4  mm has no significant effect on rate and yield of hydrolysis (Chang et al. 1997). Chipping reduces the heat and mass transfer limitations while grinding and milling effectively reduce the particle size and cellulose crystallinity due to the shear forces generated during milling. The type and duration of milling and also the kind of biomass determine the increase in specific surface area, final degree of polymerization, and the net reduction in cellulose crystallinity. Different milling methods viz. two-roll milling, hammer milling, colloid milling, and vibratory milling are used to improve the digestibility of the lignocellulosic materials (Taherzadeh and Karimi 2008). Compared to ordinary milling process, vibratory ball milling {{is found to be}} more effective in reducing cellulose crystallinity and improving the digestibility of spruce and aspen chips. Also, <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling has been a popular mechanical pretreatment because of its low energy consumption. Disk milling enhances cellulose hydrolysis by producing fibers and is more effective as compared to hammer milling which produces finer bundles (Zhua et al. 2009). Hideno et al. (2009) compared the effect of <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling and conventional ball milling pretreatment method over rice straw. The optimal conditions obtained were 60  min of milling in case of dry ball milling while 10 repeated milling operations were required in case of <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling. Maximum glucose (89.4 %) and xylose (54.3 %) were obtained with conventional ball milling method as compared to 78.5 % glucose and 41.5 % xylose with <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling method. However, <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling had lower energy requirement, high effectiveness for enzymatic hydrolysis, and did not produce inhibitors. Lin et al. (2010) found wet milling better than dry milling for the pretreatment of corn stover. The optimum parameters for milling were particle size 0.5  mm, solid/liquid ratio of 1 : 10, 20 number of steel balls of 10  mm dia each, ball speed of 350  rpm/min grounded for 30  min. Better results were obtained when milling was combined with alkaline pretreatment method. As compared to wet milling process, alkaline milling treatment increased the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of corn stover by 110 %. Sant Ana da Silva et al. (2010) performed a comparative analysis on effects of ball milling and <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling on treating sugarcane bagasse and straw and found ball milling better pretreatment method than <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling in terms of glucose and xylose hydrolysis yields. Ball milling-treated bagasse and straw produced 78.7 and 72.1 and 77.6 and 56.8 %, glucose and xylose, respectively. Kim et al. (2013) compared three different milling methods i.e., ball, attrition, and planetary milling. Attrition and planetary mills were found more effective in reducing the size of biomass as compared to ball milling. Planetary mill produced highest amount of glucose and galactose than other milling methods tested. It is to be noted that all the mill pretreatment methods do not produce any toxic compounds like hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde (HMF) and levulinic acid. This makes milling pretreatment a good choice of preliminary pretreatment method {{for a wide variety of}} lignocellulosic feed stocks. In another study, oil palm frond fiber when pretreated through ball mill produced glucose and xylose yields of 87 and 81.6 %, respectively, while empty fruit bunch produced glucose and xylose yields of 70 and 82.3 %, respectively (Zakaria et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|Wood-based {{materials}} are used extensively in residual construction worldwide. Most of the adhesives used in wood-based {{materials are}} derived from fossil resources, and some are not environmentally friendly. This study explores nanofiber technology {{as an alternative to}} such adhesives. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} three-dimensional binding effects of cellulose nanofiber (CNF), when mixed with wood flour, can significantly improve the physical and mechanical properties of wood flour board. In this study, ligno-cellulose nanofibers (LCNF) were fabricated by <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling of wood flour. Composite boards of wood flour and LCNF were produced to investigate the binding effect(s) of LCNF. The fabrication of LCNF by disk milling was simple and effective, and its incorporation into wood flour board significantly enhanced the physical and mechanical properties of the board...|$|E
40|$|Lignocellulose nanofibers were {{prepared}} by the <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> milling of wood flour. First, an ethylene-butene copolymer was pre-compounded with wood flour or lignocellulose nanofibers to prepare master batches. This process involved evaporating {{the water of the}} lignocellulose nanofiber suspension during compounding with ethylene-butene copolymer by heating at 105 °C. These master batches were compounded again with polypropylene to obtain the final composites. Since ethylene-butene copolymer is an elastomer, its addition increased the impact strength of polypropylene but decreased the stiffness. In contrast, the wood flour- and lignocellulose nanofiber-reinforced composites showed significantly higher flexural moduli and slightly higher flexural yield stresses than did the ethylene-butene/polypropylene blends. Further, the wood flour composites exhibited brittle fractures during tensile tests and had lower impact strengths than those of the ethylene-butene/polypropylene blends. On the other hand, the addition of the lignocellulose nanofibers did not decrease the impact strength of the ethylene-butene/polypropylene blends. Finally, the addition of wood flour and the lignocellulose nanofibers increased the crystallization temperature and crystallization rate of polypropylene. The increases were more remarkable {{in the case of the}} lignocellulose nanofibers than for wood flour...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{segregation}} of mixtures in a column of <b>wet</b> <b>disks</b> subjected to tapping is studied through a simple model that simulates, through a pseudo-dynamics algorithm, {{the formation of the}} packing and the successive tapping of it. The particles consist in a binary mixture of disks with two different sizes and the capillary forces are simulated stochastically by a sticking probability between the particles. We have recently shown that arch formation is one of the chief mechanisms determining size segregation in a non-convecting ensemble of dry disks (R. O. U˜nac et al., Eur. Phys. J. E 37, 117 (2014)). In the present paper, we focus on the special role that capillary bridges can have on this type of segregation process, besides the proven effect of the presence of arches. We find that humidity between grains can enhance the segregation process in a binary mixture. In particular, for the case of the segregation of an intruder, humidity can promote the rise of the big particle even in cases where the number or the size of the arches would not normally favor the climb...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} order-disorder {{transition}} of horizontally swirled dry and <b>wet</b> granular <b>disks</b> {{by means of}} computer simulations. Our systematic investigation of the local order formation {{as a function of}} amplitude and period of the external driving force shows that a large cluster of hexagonally ordered particles forms for both dry and wet granular particles at intermediate driving energies. Disordered states are found at small and large driving energies. Wet granular particles reach a higher degree of local hexagonal order with respect to the dry case. For both cases we report a qualitative phase diagram showing the amount of local order at different state points. Furthermore, we find that the transition from hexagonal order to a disordered state is characterized by the appearance of particles with square local order...|$|R
40|$|Low-angle X-ray {{diffraction}} {{arising from}} 40 to 50 A particles within wet frog retinal receptor disk membranes at 26 [deg]C was {{not consistent with}} a planar crystalline lattice of the particles within the disk membranes. The nature of the diffraction suggested {{the possibility of a}} planar liquid-like arrangement of the particles. Such an arrangement is supported by the observation that the planar ordering of the particles is easily altered by their interaction with globular protein molecules non-specifically adsorbed to the disk membranes. In view of the above, we obtained diffraction patterns from our <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> membrane preparations at several temperatures between 4. 5 and 42. 5 [deg]C, and applied a Fourier analysis to the diffracted intensities appropriate for a planar liquid-like arrangement of the 40 to 50 A particles. The analysis gave the planar radial distribution function description of the supposed planar liquid-like arrangement of the particles. These radial distribution functions, derived from the diffracted intensities, were examined in terms of their shape and variation with temperature, and compared with the known predictions from statistical mechanics for a liquidlike arrangement of particles whose pair potential contains both attractive and repulsive terms. This comparison for the derived radial distribution functions demonstrated that the observed diffraction data from the 40 to 50 A particles were indeed consistent with a planar liquid-like arrangement of these particles within the disk membrane. Our radial distribution function analysis allowed model scattering factors for the particles to be tested. It was found that only hard sphere cross-sectional electron densities for the particle with diameters of 40 to 44 A or reasonably hard, soft-sphere cross-sectional electron densities, with a core of uniform electron density 38 to 40 A in diameter and a total diameter of 44 to 46 A, gave good agreement. A similar analysis was applied to the diffracted intensities arising from the antirhodopsin molecules adsorbed to the <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> membranes which had been treated with our antirhodopsin serum and is discussed relative to the preceding paper (Blasie, Worthington & Dewey, 1969). A comparison of the radial distribution functions for the antirhodopsin molecules adsorbed to the antirhodopsin serum treated disk membranes and the 40 to 50 A particles of the untreated disk membranes at identical temperatures showed the particles to be the photopigment molecules. The mathematical derivation of the planar radial distribution function and a critical evaluation of the errors involved are presented in the Appendices...|$|E
40|$|Low-angle X-ray {{diffraction}} {{patterns were}} obtained from ordered ultracentrifugal pellets of wet receptor disk membranes which had been either treated with antirhodopsin serum, normal rabbit serum, serum albumin, or untreated prior to sedimentation. A preliminary analysis of these patterns indicated: (a) differences between antirhodopsin serum treated and untreated preparations are due to conjugation of antirhodopsin molecules with their antigen in the disk membranes and not non-specific adsorption of other serum proteins to the disk membranes, (b) the planar ordering of the adsorbed antirhodopsin molecules {{over the surface of}} the disk membrane is nearly identical to that of the 40 to 50 A particles in the untreated disk membrane. A detailed Fourier analysis of these patterns in terms of a planar liquid-like arrangement of the 40 to 50 A particles in the untreated disk membranes and the antirhodopsin molecules adsorbed to the antirhodopsin serum treated disk membranes confirmed our preliminary analysis. The planar liquid-like arrangement of the 40 to 50 A particles is nearly identical to that of the adsorbed antirhodopsin molecules (3. 0 and 3. 1 nearest neighbors at a separation of 56 and 58 A respectively at 26 [deg] +/- 0. 2 deg. C). Thus, the 40 to 50 A particles of the wet untreated disk membranes are the photopigment molecules. Electron micrographs of phosphotungstate negatively-stained disk membrane demonstrate particles ~ 40 A in diameter within the disk membrane. Optical transforms of these electron micrographs show that these particles appearing in the micrograph are arranged in a planar square array with a unit cell side of ~ 70 A. Correlation of these results with those obtained by low-angle X-ray diffraction in ultracentrifugal pellets of phosphotungstate stained and dried disk membranes as well as on wet pellets of untreated disk membranes before, during and after drying indicates the following: the ~ 40 A diameter particles seen in the electron micrographs are most likely the same 40 to 50 A particles giving rise to the observed low-angle X-ray diffraction from <b>wet</b> <b>disk</b> membranes. Hence the particles seen in the electron micrographs are most likely the nonpolar cores of the photopigment molecules...|$|E
40|$|A filter disk assay is described, which {{measures}} the penetration of antifungal agents through Candida biofilms. The technique involves forming a colony biofilm on a polycarbonate membrane filter, and capping {{it with a}} second, smaller membrane filter followed by a <b>wetted</b> paper <b>disk</b> of the type used in zone-of-inhibition assays. The entire assembly is transferred to agar medium containing the antifungal agent of interest. During subsequent incubation, the drug diffuses out of the agar and through the biofilm 'sandwich' to the moistened paper disk. The drug concentration in the disk can be determined by measuring the zone of growth inhibition that it produces on medium seeded with an indicator strain of Candida albicans in standard bioassays. Additional procedures are outlined for determining the viabilities of drug-treated biofilms and for examining biofilm morphology by scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
30|$|It must {{be pointed}} here that for quantum dots grown on [001] {{substrate}} {{there are also}} two non-equivalent axes: [110] and [11 0], with anisotropy clearly visible on shear strain distribution in Figure 3 (lower row), suggesting low C 2 v symmetry of this quantum dot system. However, {{due to the lack}} of <b>wetting</b> layer and <b>disk</b> shape of nanowire quantum dot, there is additional symmetry operation (S 4 rotoinversion [10]), and overall (lattice + dot) symmetry is actually higher than C 2 v, i.e., D 2 d. By group theoretical arguments [10, 11], we expect [001] substrate quantum dot to have zero bright exciton structure splitting but non-zero dark exciton splitting.|$|R
40|$|Flow of liquid/liquid dispersions {{have been}} {{investigated}} in a Hele-Shaw cell which contained a thin disk held between two parallel plates. This device offers a well defined flow field and also permits visual observation of the dispersed drop movement. The dispersed drops coalesce with the disk for the systems where the dispersed phase <b>wets</b> the <b>disk</b> surface. The dispersed phase accumulate at the downstream end of the disk and they detach from there as blobs. Through an accurate measurement of accumulated dispersed phase volume, the coalescence rate was determined. The coalescence efficiency in the Hele Shaw cell is determined by dividing the coalescence hate by the undisturbed flow rate of the dispersed phase through an area equal to the projected area of the disk on a plane normal to the flow direction. The coalescence efficiency first increases and then decreases with the flow rate of dispersion. The coalescence rate/disk dimensions increases with the decrease in the disk dimensions. The rate of coalescence increases {{with the increase in}} the dispersed drop diameter and it decreases with the increase in the continuous phase viscosity. The presence of surfactants reduces the coalescence rate. All these results are quantitatively explained through a model, which takes into account several important features like various mechanism of drainage, the roles of dispersion and continuous phase viscosities, and the drop deformation...|$|R
