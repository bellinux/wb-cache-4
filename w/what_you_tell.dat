During the interview before the song they reiterated {{their support for the}} campaign and their intentions to support charity with the proceeds. The campaign was ultimately successful, and [...] "Killing in the Name" [...] became the number-one single in the UK for Christmas 2009.

500|$|Gilbert {{also notes}} that Mara's {{surprising}} naivete is a welcome respite {{against a backdrop of}} a [...] "terminally jaded" [...] cast. As the show begins, aspiring journalist Zoe Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the [...] "Fairfax County Council" [...] beat to covering [...] "'what's behind the veil' of power in the Capitol hallways." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes {{that by the end of}} the first episode, Mara's Barnes is among the cadre of Frank's accomplices. After she pleads for a relationship with him by promising to earn his trust and not [...] "ask any questions", Frank uses her fiendishly. However, Ashley Parker of The New York Times considers her unfathomably aggressive and too overt, transactional and sexual. Parker points out that Barnes' statement [...] "I protect your identity, I print <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me, and I'll never ask any questions" [...] almost discredits itself.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> him, I'm not going to say that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E
