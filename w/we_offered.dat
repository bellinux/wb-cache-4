Shamir later recounted that [...] "The idea was conceived in Jerusalem by Lehi members. Our opinion was asked, and <b>we</b> <b>offered</b> no opposition." [...] With no objections raised, Zettler {{came back to}} Jerusalem and selected the team that would carry out the attack on Bernadotte, which included Meshulam Makover and Yehoshua Cohen.|$|E
2500|$|Fripp formed King Crimson {{since his}} {{previous}} group, Giles, Giles and Fripp was not commercially successful, and their record company suggested getting a proper lead singer. He chose Lake for this role, but {{asked him to}} play bass instead of guitar {{to avoid having to}} get a bass player in the group. This marked Lake's first time playing the instrument as he had primarily been a guitarist for the previous eleven years. Though Peter Sinfield was the band's lyricist, Lake had some involvement in the lyrics for their debut album In the Court of the Crimson King. After their contracted producer Tony Clarke walked away from the project, Lake produced the album. Released in October 1969, the album was an immediate commercial and critical success, as Lake recalled: [...] "There was this huge wave of response. The audiences were really into us because we were an underground thing – the critics loved us because <b>we</b> <b>offered</b> something fresh".|$|E
