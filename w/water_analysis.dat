5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological <b>water</b> <b>analysis</b> results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E

With regards to samples of soil, sewage sludge, biosolids or fecal matter from dry toilets, helminth eggs are a commonly used indicator. With helminth egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs. The viable fraction of the helminth eggs in the sample is then counted.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>water</b> pinch <b>analysis</b> {{as a tool}} for the design of optimal water {{recovery}} network {{has been one of the}} most significant advances in the area of water conservation over the last decade. <b>Water</b> pinch <b>analysis</b> is a systematic technique for implementing strategies to maximise water reuse and recycling through integration of water-using activities or processes. In this paper, possibility of achieving complete elimination of wastewater, i. e. zero discharge is assessed through the use of water regeneration units. Water regeneration has been widely accepted as an effective mean to further reduce water targets in <b>water</b> pinch <b>analysis.</b> <b>Water</b> regeneration involves the partial or total upgrading of water purity using any purification techniques. The regenerated water can either be reused in other water-using processes or recycled to the same process to further reduce water consumption and wastewater generation. A case study on a water-intensive paper mill process is used to illustrate how the water network can be optimised to achieve zero discharge. The targeting technique of <b>water</b> cascade <b>analysis</b> is used to locate the various network targets prior to the development of detailed network design.
