5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Office,</b> particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Office,</b> the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, he left Hawaii {{for a job}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> of the Inspector General at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California. While at Norton, {{he studied}} at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles before {{attending}} the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, which required him to relocate to Washington, D.C. Shortly thereafter he enrolled at Georgetown Law and completed his studies and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree. His next assignment was as vice wing commander of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at George Air Force Base in Victorville, California.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree {{took the form of}} a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} in 2011 Sorkin would be returning to television with two HBO projects. He has teamed <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Office</b> star John Krasinski to develop a miniseries about the Chateau Marmont Hotel based on Life at the Marmont, a book by the hotel's co-owner Raymond R.

The series lasted three seasons, premiering on June 24, 2012, and concluding on December 14, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy showed {{the need for}} a clear way for determining presidential disability {{in the context of the}} Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had once suffered a heart attack and – <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of Vice President to remain vacant until the next term began on January 20, 1965 – the next two people in the line of succession were the 71-year-old Speaker of the House John McCormack and the 86-year-old Senate President pro tempore Carl Hayden. Senator Birch Bayh succeeded Kefauver as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments and set about advocating for a detailed amendment dealing with presidential disability.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Nonant (sometimes Hugh de Nonant; died 27 March 1198) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Coventry in England. A great-nephew and nephew of two Bishops of Lisieux, {{he held the}} office of archdeacon in that diocese before serving {{successively}} Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury and King Henry II of England. Diplomatic successes earned him the nomination to Coventry, but diplomatic missions after his elevation led to a long delay before he was consecrated. After King Henry's death, Nonant served Henry's son, King Richard I, who rewarded him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of sheriff in three counties. Nonant replaced his monastic cathedral chapter with secular clergy, and attempted to persuade his fellow bishops to do the same, but was unsuccessful. When King Richard was captured and held for ransom, Nonant supported Prince John's efforts to seize power in England, but had to purchase Richard's favour when the king returned.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> of Mission and Ministry, Global Outreach (GO!) {{operates as}} a cultural immersion and service program where students learn about various issues of social, economic, political, and environmental injustice while living a simple lifestyle that fosters communal and spiritual growth. Teams consist of approximately 10 students, one student leader, and one chaperone to live, work, and learn with partnering organizations. Building on the Jesuit tenets of Men and Women for Others, Magis, and Contemplatives in Action, GO! has grown {{over the years to}} include more than 30 projects throughout the United States and countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. GO!'s roots stretch back to the 1950s, when Fordham students were participating in various service and immersion projects. In the 1970s and '80s it became known as the Mexico project, with students coining the term Global Outreach in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} Czarniecki {{received}} territories from the king, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of Crown oboźny. In 1653 {{he led a}} unit to Ukraine, ransacking much of the Cossack-held lands, although the attrition among the troops was high. During that campaign Czarniecki was wounded at Monastyryska. He continued his suppression campaign in 1654, and the following January {{took part in the}} battle of Okhmativ. In May 1655 he was called from Ukraine to Warsaw, as the king John Casimir Vasa, respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council, convened to discuss the looming thread of the war with Sweden. At that time his reputation was significant; Sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim Ukraine, and he was even held in much consideration by the Ottomans, then temporarily allied with the Commonwealth. On 14 May 1655 he received the office of the castellan of Kiev, a position that made him a member of the Senate of Poland.|$|E
5|$|The justices were {{assisted}} by {{a staff of}} over 50 officials, most of whom sat in Westminster Hall but also kept offices at the various Inns of Court. The Chief Clerk was the Custos Brevium, appointed by the crown, but in practice clerking matters were handled by his deputy, as the office was a royal favour rather than a serious judicial appointment. The crown also appointed the court chirographer, the officer responsible for noting final concords and filing records of fines. Another high-ranking clerk was the Clerk of the Outlawries, an under-clerk of the Attorney General for England and Wales, who was tasked with recording recognizances to protect {{the interests of the}} King in common law matters. In 1541 his position was replaced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of Clerk of the King's Process. Other offices created during the reign of Henry VIII include the Clerk of the Recognizances in 1432, who recorded debts secured by recognizances and the office of Receiver of Debts, who was tasked with receiving and recording money coming into the court via debts and fines, and was first appointed in 1536.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} has provided since 1777 {{for the election}} of a lieutenant governor, who is also ex officio president of the state senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor {{until the end of the}} yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president pro tempore acts as governor, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency pro tempore be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since 1954 with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.|$|E

In 2010 the White House and the Office of Science and Technology Policy organized a similar event with help from Hofstra University, this time held on the National Mall. Between 2010 and 2014 annual events {{took place at the}} National Mall with coordination between Hofstra University and federal agencies including: the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. In 2015 an event took place in June at the National Mall, and then back at the White House again on October 19.|$|E
5|$|Choe Bu of the Tamjin Choe clan {{was born}} in 1454 in the prefectural town of Naju in Jeollanam-do, Korea. Choe passed the jinsa {{examinations}} in 1477, which was a lower examination that did not immediately ensure a post in government; rather, it permitted enrollment in the National Academy, or Seonggyungwan, where he could study further for the higher mungwa examinations. In preparation for the exams, he studied the Five Classics as Confucian students had for centuries, but he also was taught the emphasis of the Four Books of Zhu Xi (1130–1200), which was {{in line with the}} Neo-Confucian doctrine first accepted in mainstream Chinese education during the mid-13th century. He passed his first civil service examination in 1482 and a second civil service examination in 1486, qualifying him for an immediate post in government. In a career as a graduate scholar-official that spanned 18 years, Choe was privileged with various positions. He held posts in the Hodang Library, printing office, and the National Academy. He also held posts involving the military, such as on the military supplies commission, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of the inspector-general, and with the Yongyang garrison. The culmination of his career was his promotion as a minister of the Directorate of Ceremonies in the capital, a distinguished office. Choe Bu {{was also one of the}} scholars who aided in the compilation of the Dongguk Tonggam in 1485, a history of Korea from ancient times. Choe was learned in Confucian ethics, Chinese letters, Chinese poetry, and well versed in Korean history, geography, and famous people; all this later helped him to dispel the notion of Chinese that he was a Japanese pirate instead of a Korean official who had unfortunately shipwrecked in China. In 1487, Choe Bu was sent to Jeju Island to check the registers for escaped slaves from the mainland.|$|E
