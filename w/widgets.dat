50|$|In {{the context}} of an application, a <b>widget</b> may be enabled or {{disabled}} at a given point in time. An enabled <b>widget</b> has the capacity to respond to events, such as keystrokes or mouse actions. A <b>widget</b> that cannot respond to such events is considered disabled. The appearance of a <b>widget</b> typically differs depending on whether it is enabled or disabled; when disabled, a <b>widget</b> may be drawn in a lighter color or be obscured visually in some way. See the adjacent image for an example.|$|R
25|$|The visible {{graphical}} interface {{features of}} an application are {{sometimes referred to}} as chrome or GUI (pronounced gooey). Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual <b>widgets</b> that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold. The <b>widgets</b> of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A model–view–controller allows a flexible structure in which the interface is independent from and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different skin at will, and eases the designer's work to change the interface as user needs evolve. Good user interface design relates to users more, and to system architecture less.|$|E
