50|$|There {{are three}} or four really {{extraordinary}} novels — The Silent Speaker, In the Best Families, and The Doorbell Rang, for example. These {{are some of the}} most famous and most complex and most amazing stories in the series, but we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> those particular ones for a whole complex of reasons. We wanted to pick a story that had activity in it so that we could slowly bring people into the static milieu of Nero Wolfe's house. The Golden Spiders took you outside. There's a gunfight and a tough interrogation scene. It was a very strong story with a lot of pathos, because a young boy is murdered and Wolfe has to deal with his mother. So that was why we chose that one.|$|E

5000|$|Moshinsky {{was also}} very careful about camera placement. The opening shot is a long shot of Helena, before {{eventually}} moving in to a close up. Of this opening, Moshinsky commented [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> a long shot of Helena and not move immediately to close-up — I didn't want too much identification with her, I wanted {{a picture of a}} woman caught in an obsession, with the camera static when she speaks, clear, judging her words. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> long shots because I felt they were needed to place people in their context {{and for the sake of}} atmosphere. I <b>wanted</b> the atmosphere <b>to</b> help carry the story." [...] With the exception of one shot, every shot in the episode is an interior. The only exterior shot is that of Parolles as he passes the women looking out the window in Florence. However, the shot is framed in such a way that none of the surroundings are seen. For the shot where the King and Helena dance into the great hall, the scene was shot through a pane of glass which had the ceiling and walls of the hall painted on it, to give the appearance of a much larger and grander room than was actually present. The idea for the scenes between the King and Helena to be so sexually charged was actor Donald Sinden's own.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{marked a}} {{departure}} for Templesmith {{as it was}} his first attempt at scripting his own comic.

I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> Wormwood, so I wanted to pick another smaller thing first. Whatever the outcome of that mini-series was, the process was different to how I do it now. For Singularity 7 and such, I was doing all the art from a basic plot and then adding dialogue after the event. Now I write the whole thing out first, conversationally, and then map out the pages from there, just tweaking the dialogue at the end. I think it works {{a hell of a lot}} better, too." ...|$|E

[...] “T.R. built that body,” Weigand said. “You rarely ever see pictures of him slouching. Everything was erect and forward and leaning into life.
