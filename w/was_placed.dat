5|$|In 2010, Alcocer and Martinez {{described}} a new taxon of herrerasaurid, Sanjuansaurus. It could {{be distinguished from}} Herrerasaurus based on multiple features. In the phylogenetic analysis, Herrerasaurus, Sanjuansaurus and Staurikosaurus all were in a polytomy, and Herrerasauridae was the most primitive group of saurischian, outside Eusaurischia, Eoraptor and Guaibasaurus. In 2011, Martinez et al. described Eodromaeus, a basal theropod from the same formation as Herrerasaurus. In a phylogenetic analysis, Eoraptor <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> within Sauropodomorpha, Herrerasauridae <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> as the most basal theropods, and Eodromaeus <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> as the next most basal. A more recent analysis, by Bittencourt et al. (2014), placed Herrerasauridae in a polytomy with Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, with Eoraptor also being in an unresolved position. This cladogram is shown below.|$|E
