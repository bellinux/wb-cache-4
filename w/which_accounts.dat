5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> for more than 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (<b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> for the shorter half-life), {{and appears to be}} 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E

5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight.

40|$|This {{instrumental}} study {{aimed to}} replicate the exploratory {{factor analysis of the}} Referential Thinking Scale (REF) which has been carried out in other research studies. The REF consists of 34 items which assess the frequency of referential thinking on a dichotomic scale (True/False). The analyzed data come from a sample of 193 participants (67. 36 % women, mean age 28. 36 years, SD = 10. 35), 131 of whom were patients. By means of the Principal Component Analysis method and varimax rotation, five factors were identified that account for 37. 35 % of the variance of rotated factor solution. The five factors were labelled as: Laughing, Commenting (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> for 8. 92 % of variance); Guilt, Shame (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> for 8. 77 % of variance); Causal Explanations (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> for 7. 17 % of variance); Songs, Newspapers, Books (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> for 6. 44 % of variance); and Attention, Appearance (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> for 6. 04 % of variance).

5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes.

5|$|Niels Bohr and John Archibald Wheeler {{applied the}} liquid drop {{model of the}} atomic nucleus to explain the {{mechanism}} of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both fast and slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. The former makes up just 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in natural uranium, about one in every 140; natural uranium is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of uranium-234, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> for just 0.006 percent.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is {{a member}} of the {{platinum}} group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5μg/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> {{for more}} than 90% of {{rotavirus}} gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide.

In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of}} the cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five.

Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano.
