25|$|In the 2ndcentury the satirist Lucian of Samosata {{was a sharp}} {{critic of}} Neo-Pythagoreanism.

From this we can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian’s time. One of Philostratus’ foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized {{at the same time}} that his hero was not a magician, but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.|$|E
