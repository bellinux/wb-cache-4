After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades a common policy {{recommendation}} for improving water governance has been to shift the authority over water services to sub-national government departments. The advice to decentralize builds on principal-agent arguments and the assumption that decentralization increases citizens’ possibilities to monitor the responsible bureaucrats. However, previous research provides inconclusive results concerning the effect of decentralization on corruption levels. Moreover, how decentralization impacts the enabling environment for corruption has rarely been empirically assessed despite its importance for decisions concerning institutional reform. This paper is a first attempt to contribute to resolving the uncertainty on the link between decentralization and corruption in water services. The paper empirically tests the contradictive theoretical expectations that previous research present by quantitatively comparing the enabling environment for corruption between <b>water</b> <b>utilities</b> at national, state, municipal and village level. Using survey-data collected for this paper, ANOVA-analyses show that accountability is stronger in decentralized <b>water</b> <b>utilities</b> than centralized <b>water</b> <b>utilities.</b> The analysis also suggests, but results remain non-significant, that decentralized <b>water</b> <b>utilities</b> are less subject to monopolies, while they experience more discretion than centralized <b>water</b> <b>utilities.</b> Taking all three mechanisms into account, the paper concludes that decentralized <b>water</b> <b>utilities</b> provide a less corruption-favourable environment than centralized <b>water</b> <b>utilities...</b>|$|R

This report also sought for abrupt changes in energy consumption that coincided with changes in treatment systems and reported changes that were statistically significant. Several icrofiltration and ultrafiltration utilities experienced a shift in energy consumption that coincided with the implementation of the treatment system.
