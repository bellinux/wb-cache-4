Sometimes, if we live long enough near the Great, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to have misgivings. Then there is hope for us.|$|R

He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife.

In 1999 President Clinton awarded Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, {{one of the}} nation's highest honors given to civilians. President Clinton singled Bentsen out for applause during his final State of the Union address in 2000, saying: 'In 1993 <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He's here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you.' Bentsen appeared {{in the summer of}} 2004 at the portrait unveilings at the White House of former President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Senator Hillary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way <b>we</b> <b>began</b> feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way." ...|$|E

[...] But [...] numbers seemed to amuse the real Queen more than {{anything}} else in the opera, and, indeed, who could so well as she see the point of them? [...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who do you suppose was singled out for that honour? Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E

Poniewozik described the competition showdown as [...] "unconnected with the episode <b>we</b> <b>began</b> watching", and Canning said that [...] "Regionals just got in the way" [...] and the performances [...] "did a disservice {{to what was going}} on with Karofsky". Votta characterized the McKinley victory as [...] "so secondary to the point of this episode that it feels completely anticlimactic", and VanDerWerff summarized, [...] "When New Directions hoists that trophy aloft at the end, it’s about the least compelling victory for the group yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Holmes {{noted that}} he had outlived most of his friends, {{including}} Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. As he said, [...] "I feel like my own survivor... We were on deck together as <b>we</b> <b>began</b> the voyage of life... Then the craft which held us began going to pieces." [...] His last public appearance was at a reception for the National Education Association in Boston on February 23, 1893, where he presented the poem [...] "To the Teachers of America". A month later, Holmes wrote to Harvard president Charles William Eliot that the university should consider adopting the honorary doctor of letters degree and offer one to Samuel Francis Smith, though one was never issued.|$|E

[...] actor Garrett Wang tweeting, [...] "The casting of Cumberbatch {{was a mistake}} {{on the part of}} the producers. I am not being {{critical}} of the actor or his talent, just the casting." [...] Co-producer and co-screenwriter Roberto Orci addressed the issue of the casting saying, [...] "Basically, as we went through the casting process and <b>we</b> <b>began</b> honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that. One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within us, not some other race." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a {{freelance}} cellist in London. He recalled, [...] "My first orchestral engagement {{was with the}} Queen's Hall Orchestra – I was probably the youngest orchestral musician ever, joining them in 1916. We had an enormous repertory – six concerts a week, three hours or more rehearsal a day. In those days we were happy if <b>we</b> <b>began</b> and finished together". While playing in the Queen's Hall Orchestra, Barbirolli also played in the opera pit for the Beecham and Carl Rosa opera companies, in recitals with the pianist Ethel Bartlett, with orchestras in theatres, cinemas, hotels and dance-halls, and, as he said, [...] "everywhere except the street". During {{the last year of}} World War I, Barbirolli enlisted in the army and became a lance-corporal in the Suffolk Regiment. Here he had his first opportunity to conduct, when an orchestra of volunteers was formed. He later described the experience: ...|$|E
500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>began,</b> we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E
500|$|The {{next season}} Villa {{did not start}} well {{and they were in}} mid-table at Christmas {{although}} the club was still in the European Cup. In the first round Villa beat Valur 70 on aggregate. In the second round they scored twice at Dynamo Berlin to achieve a 22 draw, which saw them go through due to the away goals rule. These victories were in contrast to their poor performance in the league. By February 1982, the club were lying 19th in the First Division and Saunders resigned. It was later disclosed that the then chairman, Ron Bendall, had offered him a revised, shorter term, contract, which he had refused to accept. Saunders' assistant Tony Barton was promoted in his place. When Barton took over, although Villa were in a poor league position, they were in the quarter-final of the European Cup. In the quarter-finals, they beat Dynamo Kiev over two legs. Gordon Cowans is quoted as saying, [...] "Once we got past Dynamo Kiev <b>we</b> <b>began</b> thinking we could go all the way." [...] In the semi-final, they played Anderlecht over two legs, with Tony Morley scoring to secure Aston Villa's place in the final.|$|E
