40|$|In recent years, {{the sharp}} {{increase}} in Uruguayan unemployment rates {{has been accompanied by}} the perception that the risk of unemployment is unevenly distributed so that some groups are more prone to undergo long periods of unemployment. This research aims to complement the information reflected in the unemployment rate with the one referred to its duration, for the period 1986 - 1999. First, it studies the so-called “incomplete duration” of unemployment, as reported by the National Statistics Institute. This indicator informs about the job-search time until the information is collected. However, {{it is important to have}} an effective indicator to describe the <b>whole</b> <b>unemployment</b> period. For that reason, an estimator to give account of the time the unemployed people should expect before returning to employment is calculated. It is based on the calculation of conditional probability of remaining unemployed proposed by Sider (1985), Baker (1992), Corak and Heisz (1996). The study shows that the average complete unemployment spell reached four months for the whole population, which is a long one, considering the dynamics of economic growth between 1986 and 1999. It also finds differences among demographic groups in terms of their entry to unemployment and their total unemployment spell. Finally, it is established that the increase in the unemployment spell in aggregate terms has not been led by an increase in the incidence of groups typically associated to longer durations (compositional effect), but to an increase in duration for all groups. In short, most of the variation in the total unemployment spell duration has been caused by variations in the aggregate unemployment rate rather than by changes in the individual characteristics of the unemployed people. unemployment, unemployment duration spell...|$|E

The impact response of output is 0.29 p.p. of GDP and the cumulative response reaches 1.68 p.p of GDP {{two years after the}} shock. In the pre-EAP period the output response profile followed a hump-shaped pattern having a negative impact response. The response of unemployment is slightly more pronounced compared to a government purchases shock in the first 1 – 2  years after the shock but then it declines at a much faster pace (Figures  2 B- 2 C). The pre-EAP unemployment response is smaller on impact, but more pronounced until the 6 - 7 th quarter. Thereafter, it decays more rapidly.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{well known}} that {{unemployment}} is a great problem both to the exposed individual and to the <b>whole</b> society. <b>Unemployment</b> is reported as more common among young people compared to the general level of unemployment. Inequity in health status and life-satisfaction is related to unemployment. The purpose of this population-based study was to describe QOL among unemployed young people compared to those who are not unemployed, and to analyse variables related to QOL for the respective groups. Methods The sample consisted of 264 young unemployed individuals and 528 working or studying individuals as a reference group. They all received a questionnaire about civil status, educational level, immigration, employment status, self-reported health, self-esteem, social support, social network, spare time, dwelling, economy and personal characteristics. The response rate was 72 %. The significance of differences between proportions was tested by Fisher's exact test or by χ 2 test. Multivariate analysis was carried out by means of a logistic regression model. Results Our results balance the predominant picture of youth unemployment as a principally negative experience. Although the unemployed reported lower levels of QOL than the reference group, a majority of unemployed young adults reported good QOL, and 24 % even experienced higher QOL after being unemployed. Positive QOL related not only to good health, but also to high self-esteem, satisfaction with spare time and broad latitude for decision-making. Conclusion Even if QOL is good among a majority of unemployed young adults, inequalities in QOL were demonstrated. To create more equity in health, individuals who report reduced subjective health, especially anxiety need extra attention and support. Efforts should aim at empowering unemployed young adults by identifying their concerns and resources, and by creating individual programmes in relation not only to education and work, but also to personal development. </p...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} poverty reduction, the essentiality of labour, and entrepreneurship as a way of creating opportunities, the need for labour law in the workplace, while referring to some of the constraints it may place on employers, labour practices and finding a win-win solution for all three players within the labour relationship to the benefit of the greater economy as a <b>whole.</b> Tackling <b>unemployment</b> is arguably South Africa's most important priority, while realising that the country will only attract investment in labour-absorptive sectors if it is competitive in terms of labour unit costs. Government has committed it to an employment strategy framework, while at the same time challenging business and labour to participate. There is a need for capable individuals who are prepared to accept the brunt of risk, to assist in job creation and assist in positive growth in the economy. We are part of a capitalistic SOCiety. Entrepreneurship offers the total solution. It places no risk on government or the employee, while having the ability to assist in the creation of jobs and with the alleviation of poverty. Entrepreneurship needs to be positively influenced and encouraged so as to fill the void emanating from high unemployment, and help the economy further. Potential entrepreneurs find themselves lost in a maze of legalities and tax laws, coupled with the unavailability of capital and heavy taxes on any positive returns, creating a barrier to entry for entrepreneurs. Labour is a very real necessity in the need for progress and actual implementation of opportunities. The essence of labour laws is to ensure no exploitation of workers, create fair working conditions and reward for the worker. South Africa has a very turbulent labour history. The characteristics of the labour market are commitment to the social contract; removal of obstacles in the way of international trade and production; reduction in unemployment. There are three players in the labour market, being employers, employees and government, who all have to contribute their shares before successful production can take place...|$|R

There he advocated more prompt and smooth action by the Bank of England in order to effectively stabilize the movement of general prices and the economy as a whole. In order for its action not to be affected by external monetary shocks, he suggested the withdrawal from the gold standard should the public opinion and international diplomatic relations allow it. Pigou, meanwhile, placed much less importance on wage adjustment as a palliative against business cycle. The recent studies direct {{attention to the fact that}} Pigou pointed out that after World War I money wages were made rigid by such factors as contemporary institutional changes in labor markets. This picture, however, lacks a more important element of his thought: the monetary cause due to the gold standard on the prewar parity.

40|$|The {{crises of}} the past few years have led to a {{significant}} increase in youth unemployment in Europe. This, in turn, has highlighted the long standing phenomenon of well above average youth unemployment. In some countries, the youth unemployment rate reached unprecedented levels, although the rise of unemployment among young people was no more significant than among adults. Furthermore, the media portrayal of young people's situation is sometimes more negative than the reality, failing to take into consideration that the majority of young people are not even on the labor market but still completing their education. Nonetheless, across much of Europe, youth unemployment has become a more pressing social problem than it was a few years ago. In the EU as a <b>whole,</b> the youth <b>unemployment</b> rate is more than double the unemployment rate affecting the general population. Only in some countries is this connected with-alongside other factors-inadequate qualifications among young people because, even with training, young people are more likely to be unemployed than adults. However, in countries providing a high degree of professional training, employment prospects are not as poor as in those focusing predominantly on educational qualifications. Practical vocational training is obviously a potential tool for creating better job prospects for young people. The German labor market is the most open. In Germany, the fact that the youth unemployment rate is only slightly above average is solely the result of skills deficits.

40|$|Against the {{background}} of overall fiscal costs of registered unemployment amounting to DM 150 billion in 1999 this paper deals with the function of {{active labour market policy}} measures in accordance with the Social Code III in easing this situation. The paper is intended to examine the extent to which labour market policy can support employment in the economy as a <b>whole</b> and ease <b>unemployment</b> and to look into how the individual measures can be assessed under economic aspects. Here the net costs of labour market policy are decisive (gross costs of the measures minus decreases in expenditure and additional income as a result of avoided unemployment). The calculations of this relief for the labour market and the cost-benefit considerations can only provide elements of efficiency considerations. They are partial analyses which contain uncertainties as a result of existing method problems. There is still {{a lot of work to}} be done in the fields of aggregate impact analysis. The overall self-financing rates of employment-creation measures for 1999 amount to between 66 % and 89 %, depending on whether indirect relief effects are excluded or included. For the budget of the Federal Employment Services itself they are estimated at 20 % to 30 %. In the case of measures to promote further vocational training the overall self-financing rate is estimated at 60 %. For the budget of the Federal Employment Services the figure is 31 %. The strain on the national budget is eased considerably in each case, as there is lower expenditure on both unemployment assistance and tax revenue. This alone justifies a contribution from the national government to the budget of the Federal Employment Services.

Residents of Fairfield City come from over 200 countries, making it a City rich in cultural diversity. More than half of all residents speak a language other than English at home (72. 5 %). Fairfield LGA has more residents, who speak English poorly or not at all, than any other Australian LGA. Fairfield City accepts more migrants than any other City in Australia. Families living within South West Sydney include some of the most disadvantaged families within the metropolitan area. Families across the region face multiple problems, including financial hardship, gambling, drug abuse, domestic violence and poor health. Results of the Socio-Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA) measurements show Fairfield is in the bottom 10 % of the State: 876 (4 th worst in State), reflecting the relative disadvantage compared with the State as a <b>whole</b> (ABS 2006). <b>Unemployment</b> rates in Fairfield City have been consistently higher than the rates for Sydne...|$|R

40|$|Le chômage saisonnier en {{existence}} au Canada et dans la province de Québec en particulier pose de graves problèmes qui ont leurs répercussions sur le plan économique et social. S'appuyant sur des chiffres et sur des faits éloquents, l'auteur examine cette situation et expose les rôles joués par les gouvernements fédéral et provinciaux dans le but de l'améliorer. Some {{facts and}} figures illustrate better than a long article {{the social and economic}} impact of the seasonal unemployment of {{an important part of the}} workers. In 1961, the population of the Province of Quebec amounted to 1, 471, 840 people, according to the Federal Census. At the end of January of the same year, 83, 791 people, according to the estimates of the Federal Minister of Labour, were without employment, i. e. a proportion of nearly 89 fc of the total-man power; at the end of February, 1952, 114, 973 people were in the same situation, making up at this time almost 8 % of the total active population. In studying the figures of the variations in employment since 1948, the following facts may be noted:The most recent information that we have on the length of unemployment in our district, show that on February 1, 1955, 53. 5 % or 7 705 people capable of work were looking for employment since a month or more than a month. The number of those looking for employment represented 7. 5 % of the active labour supply in the Quebec métropolitain district. If one takes into account the maximum weekly unemployment insurance payments made to unemployed persons, one may realize not only thé acuteness of the problems created to the families and to the society as a <b>whole</b> by seasonal <b>unemployment,</b> but also the depreciation of the collective buying power that the presence of such a large inactive mass creates in a district or a locality which may result in serious economic evils. Our province, and particularly our district, are especially vulnerable to the harm done by seasonal unemployment. The district of Quebec is, furthermore, very frequently a district with an excess of man-power, this surplus being mainly made of general or non-specialized labour coming to a large extent from neighbouring or more distant rural territories; for these workers, of which a large number emigrate by necessity, the city and district of Quebec constitutes the first stage and, quite often, the end of their road. There is then brought into existence in the metropolitan district a state of what could be called permanent unemployment, the unemployment that is known as "structural" unemployment, and which may be defined as being the result of a "surplus of labour in a city, and economic district or a country, taking into account the capacities for absorption of existing enterprises". A certain number of our industries, even important ones, are subject to two other particular types of unemployment: "competitive" unemployment, which, through the play of certain economic factors, result from the reduction in production in a plant or in an industrial sector. This "competitive" unemployment is characterized by a temporary lay-off, by a reduced work week or by shorter work days or by both. Finally, "competitive" unemployment may also lead to the worst, that is to say, the permanent dismissal of labour. The other type of unemployment, is technological unemployment which consists of the loss of employment brought about by new processes, new machines or new organization methods or even caused by the temporary or permanent loss of a market due to changes in consumers' tastes. If one examines finally the structure of the labour market of the Quebec district, one can easily detect that there exists a certain "occupational" lack of balance. Our territory contains a high percentage of seasonal industries or business. Furthermore, it is a market where a relatively high percentage of feminine labour is to be found, characterized by a frequently high turnover. NECESSITY OF POSITIVE MEASURESThe Federal government, who is considered in most circles as responsible for the general employment policy, has recently decided to alter the programme of public works wrich it was keeping in reserve in provision of general unemployment and to set up a new short-range programme more flexible, more changeable and more easily adaptable to employment conditions in the various regions of the country. Moreover, the provincial governments seem ready to carry out the various public works in taking their inspiration from the same conceptions, and in coordinating as much as possible the programme of public investment with that of the Federal government. An attempt is being made to apply the same methods to the level of municipal administrations. The main purpose of the government action should be to stimulate private activity or in other words, to give it a greater impetus. It only constitutes a partial and negative solution of the problem we are examining just now. It has become necessary to add some positive measures by making more flexible the income tax regulation on depreciation of capital invested during the months of seasonal unemployment, by influencing through some positive measures the private as well as the public policies on credit and by certain other action of a similar nature, which would have as direct result the quickening of private initiative...|$|R

La seconde partie traite principalement des conséquences du chômage sur les niveaux de vie, la sécurité, les besoins et les aspirations de la famille du salarié. Cet article fait partie d'une étude plus vaste sur les conditions de vie des travailleurs salariées de la Province de Québec. Cette étude est entreprise par le Centre de Recherches sociales de l'Université Laval, en collaboration avec la Fédération des Caisses Populaires Desjardins et l'Assurance-Vie Des jardins. The authors-wish {{to express}} their thanks to the Commission's staff who translated their original brief. An edited version appears here. Unemployment is a phenomenon which has been analyzed mostly in macro-economic terms. In the more usual studies an attempt is made to determine {{the size of the}} number of unemployed in relation to the total labour force, as well as the general causes of the increase in the percentage of unemployed. While we do not deny the importance of this approach, there remain a large number of micro-economic and sociological aspects which have received much less attention from the researchers, but which are also of great importance for economic planning. In the course of the study on living conditions of French-Canadian families we gathered data which enables us to examine unemployment among the workers of Quebec from certain angles. The research program is not centered on the unemployment problem, but rather on the living conditions of wage-earners, on the structure of the family budget, and on the needs and aspirations of families. For the purposes of the study, 1, 460 families distributed throughout the Province of Quebec were interviewed during the summer of 1959. The questionnaire used for those interviews furnished data on the family budget during one year (from the summer of 1958 until the summer of 1959). The population studied comprises all the complete families (married at least one year), of French origin that are families of wage-earners in the Province of Quebec. The sample was stratified according to the characteristics of the municipality in which the families live. Six different groups of families were formed in this way: (1) wage-earning families in the metropolitan centres (Montreal and Quebec); (2) families in towns with a population of over 30, 000; (3) families in towns with a population of between 5, 000 and 30, 000; (4) families living in villages of rural municipalities where agriculture is prosperous; (5) families in villages of rural municipalities where agriculture is average; (6) families in villages of municipalities where agriculture is poor. Before commenting at greater length on the implications of the high percentage of unemployed in rural areas, it is necessary to define the yardstick which we use to measure unemployment. This method {{is quite different from the}} measurement used by the government agencies. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics, as well as the Federal Unemployment Insurance Commission, measures the intensity of unemployment by calculating the percentage of the labour force that is without work at a given moment. Thus, we find that in November 1960, 6 per cent of the Canadian labour force was without work, whereas in October 1960, that percentage was 5 &. Those rates do not enable us to determine whether the workers who were unemployed in November had also been unemployed in October, nor the average duration of unemployment. The measurement which we use is different in two respects. Firstly, instead of taking the whole labour force into account, undifferentiated, we consider only those unemployed persons who are heads of families, that is, the workers whose instability of employment affects a large number of dependents. Secondly, we take into account the number of families whose heads have been unemployed at any time during the year between the summer of 1958 and the summer of 1959. Thus if it is found in our study that 29 per cent of French-Canadian wage-earning families were exposed to unemployment at some time during the year while the maximum monthly rate of unemployment (as compiled by the government agencies) was 5 per cent during that period, it can be deduced that the heads of families who were questioned were unemployed at different periods of the year. The average duration of unemployment per family (19 weeks) underlines the plausibility of this distribution of the phenomenon in terms of time. This method of measuring unemployment makes it possible to grasp more clearly the importance of under-employment in the Province of Quebec by laying bare certain phenomena that have been concealed by the other measurements. Thus, during the year 1958 - 1959, more than one-quarter of the wage-earning families of our sample were affected by unemployment at one time or other. That is a much larger proportion than one would gather from the official statistics. Furthermore, in the rural communities, unemployment affects between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the families. The importance of unemployment is no doubt connected with the structure of occupation in the various communities. We can only present here a brief analysis of the characteristics of various industries and occupations in the urban and rural communities. A more thorough study would be necessary in order to situate the unemployment problem in its total context. DISTRIBUTION OF UNEMPLOYMENTThe percentage of families affected by unemployment increases as we move away from the large urban centres. The same relationship exists when we consider the percentage of families who have drawn unemployment insurance during the year. Even if it is the big cities which have the largest absolute number of unemployed, as the official statistics indicate, it is in those centres where their relative number is the smallest. In terms of probability, the urban worker is therefore less exposed to unemployment than his opposite number in the remote rural areas. The average length of the period of unemployment varies very little from one place to another. It is about four months. It is therefore not the duration of unemployment which varies from one community to the other, but rather the probability of becoming unemployed. The place of present residence is the chief factor associated with unemployment. Whatever his place of birth, the worker living in the rural community is more exposed to unemployment than the one living in the city. Moreover, the worker born in the urban community is less exposed to unemployment than the one who is born in the country. There is therefore reason to believe that the worker of city origin is better prepared to find steady employment. Finally, workers of rural origins, considerably decrease the probability of being unemployed by migrating to the city. It would seem important to verify this relationship with wider samples before accepting it absolutely. However, a brief analysis of the occupational structure in rural and urban communities may make it possible to explain in part the lower rate of unemployment that is characteristic of the urban community. We must bear in mind, first of all, that unemployment affects primarily the unskilled workers. This tendency has been shown by al! the studies on unemployment in Canada. In our population 90 per cent of the workers who were unemployed during the year were semi-skilled workers or labourers. It must also be remembered that in Canada seasonal unemployment is one of the main forms, if not the main form of unemployment. Moreover, the seasonal industries employ a very large number of unskilled workers (stevedores, lumber-cutters, construction labourers, transport labourers, etc.). The level of qualification of the rural workers is lower than that of the urban workers. That may be explained by their lower level of education, but also by the nature of the jobs which they can find in their community. The great majority of rural jobs are seasonal (bush work, transportation, construction work, road building, mining etc.) and require few qualifications. Moreover, the rural worker has difficulty finding a job in his locality. At least half of the rural workers must travel to their place of work. Quite often those journeys are so great that the worker is obliged to spend several days and even several weeks away from his home. Once he is out of work, the rural worker may therefore prefer to remain at home and draw unemployment insurance benefits before exiling himself once more in order to look for work. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCESThe consequences of unemployment at the level of family life are fairly easy to predict. It is perhaps for that reason that few researchers have attempted to analyze them in terms of concrete examples. The systematic analysis of those consequences is, however, important if we wish to know the exact nature of this social evil, unemployment. The standard of living of families subject to unemployment is lower than that of other families. The available income per unit of consumption is decidedly lower. Half of the families where the head is out of work have an annual income of less than $ 900 per unit of consumption. The possession of the personal property common to French-Canadian homes is measured by an index. Families where there is unemployment own fewer house hold goods than other families. Thus, not only is current income lower, but the total investment in goods is lower too. From that it can be assumed that the precariousness of the economic situation is not a recent, accidental phenomenon, but a state which lasts for some time. It is perhaps in regard to the steps taken to insure the security of the family that the destitution of the unemployed is most pronounced. We built a security index: the items comprising that index are the possession of life insurance, health insurance, a pension plan, etc. Nearly half the families of unemployed workers have no guarantee of security in case of family disaster, while 74 per cent of the other families have an acceptable combination of insurance plans in case of unforeseen emergencies. The family of the unemployed worker therefore has to suffer not only from the hardships due to the lack of work, but is also vulnerable to all unforeseen calamities which may strike it. Another important point is, that the unemployed predict that owing to lack of money they will not be able to give their children the minimum of education which they consider necessary in our modern society. If this prediction comes true, the children, for lack of adequate preparation, will have to be employed as labourers or semi-skilled workers when they begin their careers. The probability of their becoming unemployed in their turn will therefore be fairly great (especially if we consider the future progress of automation). Unemployment may therefore easily become a heritage that is perpetuated from generation to generation. The fact that the unemployed have less chance to provide a sufficient income for their families in case of emergencies or illness is one indication of the difficulty they have in saving. Actually, the premiums of the various forms of insurance necessary for security of the family are savings which the unemployed person does not succeed in making. We find this inability to save when it comes to savings in the form of bank deposits or purchases of bonds. When the family exposed to unemployment does succeed in saving, it does so in order to provide against contingencies that are likely to occur soon. The families whose heads have a steady job ordinarily save for a more or less indefinite and remote purpose. The unemployed person who manages to save usually has to withdraw his savings to meet the necessities of daily life. For all the families exposed to unemployment, the indebtedness during a year is greater than the savings. ConclusionsThese few considerations on the geographical distribution of unemployment and on the socio-economic condition of the unemployed worker's family pose more problems, in fact, than they enable us to solve. Unemployment is a major economic and sociological problem. The politicians who seek to find a solution to it should, in our opinion, base themselves on research centred on two main poles. After defining the various types of unemployment (seasonal, structural, etc.,) they should determine the incidence of those types according to the economic regions, urban and rural communities, etc. This analysis should be accompanied by a structure-functional analysis of the regional economies. There no doubt exist some large-scale economic remedies for unemployment (increased exports, deficit budgeting, etc.). But to be really effective, most of those measures need an organic adaptation to the local situation. No doubt such measures also demand some co-ordination between the various sectors of industry and various levels of government. However, unemployment does not only have causes, it also has effects on the life of society, on family life and on the life of the individual. Our observations have enabled us to show that the <b>whole</b> phenomenon of <b>unemployment</b> does not strike just any workers, but rather particular classes of workers. Among heads of families, unemployment appears to be a more or less hereditary phenomenon in the less favoured environments. This is not an accident in the career of an individual, but rather a more or less permanent state peculiar to certain individuals. This permanence of unemployment at the individual level, is creating among us a real proletariat characterized by a very low standard of living, the total absence of security in case of emergencies, and the impossibility of aspiring to a better lot for future generations. It is important that this first analysis of the problem should be supplemented by an analysis of the effects of unemployment on the single worker. Likewise, it would be important to determine the implications both for the family and for the single person of various types of unemployment. Such research would make it possible not only to prepare programs of economic expansion and of co-ordination of industries, but also to ensure greater economic and social security through the adoption of measures proportionate to the needs of the various types of workers. Thus, it would be possible, we hope, to nip this emerging proletariat in the bud...|$|R
