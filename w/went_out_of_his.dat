5|$|As he {{prepared}} {{to run for president}} in 2000, Vice President Al Gore attempted to maintain good relations with the Jackson family, hoping to discourage Jackson's father from running for president against him. Jackson received a congratulatory call from Gore after his election in 1995. In 1998, Gore campaigned for and advised Jackson, and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way to instruct aides to create a vice presidential event in Jackson's district to boost Jackson.|$|E
5|$|When Veronica discovers new {{evidence}} that suggests that Lilly's convicted killer is innocent, she decides to investigate the case. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an 09er party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace, Neptune High basketball star; Weevil, leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang; and Mac, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, {{as well as those}} provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way to harass her.|$|E

The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens. Liam often stole bicycles from local shops. He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury; despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in Spring 1990. He gained 4 GCSEs.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s Gryce reinvented {{himself as}} a public school teacher in New York. He was {{somewhat}} interested in education throughout his life, and {{was said to be}} an excellent music instructor. He received a master's degree in education from Fordham University in 1978 and developed an incredible passion for teaching. He left a lasting legacy at Elementary School No. 53 in the Bronx, which was renamed in his honor after his death. Students, colleagues, and parents who encountered Gryce during this time knew him as a very private, serious, passionate, and caring man. Believing that music aided literacy, Gryce was a strict but caring teacher, and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way to aid students at educational risk, working at an under-resourced mostly black and Hispanic school.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this type}} of terrain that aerial attacks were used with limited effectiveness. French made Mirage 2000H of the IAF were tasked to drop laser-guided bombs to destroy well-entrenched {{positions}} of the Pakistani forces. The IAF lost a MiG-27 strike aircraft, which it attributed to an engine failure, and a MiG-21 fighter which was shot down by Pakistan; initially Pakistan said it shot down both jets after they crossed into its territory. One Indian Mi-8 helicopter was also lost due to Stinger SAMs. On 27 May 1999, Flt. Lt. Nachiketa developed engine trouble in the Batalik sector and bailed out of his craft. Sqn Ldr Ajay Ahuja <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way to locate his comrade but was shot down by a shoulder-fired Stinger missile. According to reports, he had bailed out of his stricken plane safely but was apparently killed by his captors as his body was returned riddled with bullet wounds.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E

The incident left its mark on Olds such that when he became Commandant of Cadets at the Air Force Academy, use of the Honor Code as an instrument for integrity rather than as a tool for petty enforcement of discipline became a point of emphasis in his administration.

When he suddenly found a group of friends that would accept him for himself, as he did in Cleveland in 1964, the 'compensation' factor <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> drawing, and this was pretty much the end of Fritz's impetus." ...|$|E
500|$|After being {{voted out}} as sheriff, Keith opens a private {{investigation}} agency, Mars Investigations, where Veronica works part-time. Veronica helps her father solve cases and conducts her own investigations {{on behalf of}} friends and acquaintances at school. Veronica discovers new evidence which suggests that Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson), the man imprisoned after confessing to Lilly's murder, is innocent. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder case, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an [...] "09er" [...] party.

500|$|Nixon {{spent most}} of 1946 campaigning in the district, and worked hard to extend his name {{recognition}} beyond his hometown of Whittier. [...] In 1952, as Nixon ran for vice president, the Madera News-Tribune set forth its view of why Nixon beat Voorhis, [...] "He rang doorbells, he talked on street corners and in auditoriums, he kissed babies, patted old ladies on the cheek, and otherwise made himself known wherever and whenever two people would stop and listen to him. He made friends with the press and radio, he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way to be congenial and likable." [...] Bullock indicated that regardless of the tactics used, Nixon would likely have beaten the incumbent given the national Republican tide that swept the party into power in the House of Representatives {{for the first time}} since 1931.|$|E

Shero credited his childhood experiences as a reason why he tended to be a loner. As a child Shero took up boxing and at age 13 he became a Canadian Bantamweight champion. His success gave him a chance to become a professional boxer, but he decided to play hockey instead. When he signed his first professional contract with the Rangers, his father cautioned him that [...] "hockey players are looking for work when they are 30."

500|$|Farrell's {{next film}} was 2005's Academy Award-nominated The New World, his second {{historical}} epic. He played {{the lead role}} of Captain John Smith, the founder of 17th-century colonial Jamestown, Virginia {{who falls in love}} with the Native American princess Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). Director Terrence Malick <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way to keep Farrell and Kilcher apart until they were filmed together. Although it was released in only 811 theatres worldwide and had a relatively low box-office gross, the film received a large number of positive reviews. In one of four reviews in The Guardian, John Patterson described it as a [...] "bottomless movie, almost unspeakably beautiful and formally harmonious". The New World was followed by Ask the Dust, a period romance set in Los Angeles based on a John Fante novel and co-starring Salma Hayek. Reviews were mixed; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times favourably described Farrell's work, but Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found [...] "something a little forced in both lead performances". With a limited theatrical release, it was not a financial success.|$|E
500|$|Amy Dudley's death, {{happening}} amid renewed {{rumors about}} the Queen and her favourite, caused [...] "grievous and dangerous suspicion, and muttering" [...] in the country. Robert Dudley was shocked, dreading [...] "the malicious talk that I know the wicked world will use". William Cecil, the Queen's Principal Secretary, felt himself {{threatened by the}} prospect of Dudley's becoming king consort and spread rumours against the eventuality. Already knowing of her death before it was officially made public, he told the Spanish ambassador that Lord Robert and the Queen wished to marry and were about to do away with Lady Dudley by poison, [...] "giving out that she was ill but she was not ill at all". Likewise strongly opposed to a Dudley marriage, Nicholas Throckmorton, the English ambassador in France, <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> way {{to draw attention to the}} scandalous gossip he heard at the French court. Although Cecil and Throckmorton made use of the scandal for their political and personal aims, they did not believe themselves that Robert Dudley had orchestrated his wife's death.|$|E
