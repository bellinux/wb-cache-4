5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer {{to take over the}} troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{concluded}} as the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> for the United States Air Force in Vietnam since 2 December 1966, {{when they}} had lost five aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam in a single day. Consequently, the actions of 23 August became known as ‘Black Wednesday’ amongst U.S. pilots who participated in air operations over Hanoi on that particular day. The USAF officially confirmed the loss of three F-4D fighters during the raid against the Yen Vien rail yard, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of Weapon Systems Officers Captain Ronald N. Sittner (66-0238, 8th TFW) and First Lieutenant Charles Lane (66-00247, 8th TFW). Major Charles R. Tyler, Captain Larry E. Carrigan, Major Robert R. Sawhill and First Lieutenant Gerald L. Gerndt ejected safely from their aircraft, but they were captured alive and became prisoners of war. Major C.B. Demarque and his Weapons System Officer, First Lieutenant J.M. Piet were rescued shortly after they ejected from their malfunctioned aircraft over Thai airspace.|$|E

25|$|The {{first day}} on the Somme (1 July) saw a serious defeat for the German Second Army, which was forced out of its first {{position}} by the French Sixth Army, from Foucaucourt-en-Santerre south of the Somme to Maricourt on the north bank and by the Fourth Army from Maricourt to the vicinity of the Albert–Bapaume road. The {{first day on}} the Somme was, in terms of casualties, also the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> {{in the history of the}} British army, which suffered 57,470 casualties. These occurred mainly on the front between the Albert–Bapaume road and Gommecourt, where the attack was defeated and few British troops reached the German front line. The British troops on the Somme comprised a mixture of the remains of the pre-war regular army; the Territorial Force; and Kitchener's Army, a force of volunteer recruits including many Pals' Battalions, recruited from the same places and occupations.|$|E

500|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was {{expected}} to be unhelpful for fast bowling. Opener Len Hutton was dropped by Hassett on 25, after flicking the ball behind square leg from Loxton’s bowling. This proved to be costly, as Hutton reached 81 before falling at 1/168. England were 2/268 {{at the end of the}} first day. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and said that it was the country’s <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses.|$|E

40|$|Airport gates {{are one of}} the {{congestion}} {{points of}} the air transportation system. When an arriving flight lands on a runway, it is possible that it cannot pull into its gate due to gate unavailability. We define this phenomenon as gate-waiting delay. This paper gives a functional analysis of gate-waiting delays at New York Laguardia airport (LGA) for 92 days in the summer of 2007. We find that daily delays are typically not problematic (less than 600 minutes in 80 days). However, in the <b>worst</b> <b>days,</b> delays can be extremely large (1200 to 2400 minutes in the <b>worst</b> 4 <b>days</b> when <b>worst</b> 6 delayed flights are delayed for almost 3 hours in average). In the 12 <b>worst</b> <b>days,</b> there are 9 days in which delays can be attributed to a higher gate demand than the number of existing gates. On 8 of these days, this is due to compressed arrivals. On one day, this is due to increased gate-occupancy times. Delay mitigation strategies are also discussed...|$|R

[...] She initially experienced a period of severe difficulty with the disease, and later said: [...] "I was very sick in 1998 when I was diagnosed.

500|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was {{predicted}} to be unhelpful for fast bowling. Thirty minutes before tea, England brought up their 150 without loss, and continued unhindered after two brief interruptions due to rain. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate. Bradman brought on Johnson, who had delivered only three overs so far, {{the rest of}} the proceedings having been through fast bowlers. Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman gave Johnson a ring field with no slip. Johnson bowled two consecutive maidens, but Washbrook was scoring freely at the other end, so Bradman called for the new ball and brought back the fast bowlers. Johnson was still wicketless when England closed the day at 2/268. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton accused Australia of going [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and regarded their performance as their <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses.|$|E

[...] A second preview of the music video, shot in a dance studio, premiered on November 25, 2011.

Gaga took her Twitter to express dissatisfaction with the leak of the video, saying that it was [...] "like an old tampon." [...] The video for the song is 13minutes long.|$|E
500|$|Former Test batsman Jack Fingleton, {{who covered}} the tour as a journalist, said Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and {{described}} the efforts as the country's <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses. England had batted conservatively, steadily accumulating runs on a pitch unfavourable for fast bowlers, and Miller bowled placidly. Fingleton's fellow journalist and former playing colleague O'Reilly criticised the bowling display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said none of the bowlers could be excused. He lambasted the attack for operating [...] "without objecthopelessly and meaninglessly" [...] throughout the day. He decried the [...] "so-called attack" [...] for being [...] "so blatantly inaccurate both in direction in length" [...] and likened it to what was on offer in [...] "another monotonously uninteresting county match". O'Reilly criticised Bradman's players for what he regarded as an overly casual and relaxed disposition in the morning, which gradually became more lethargic throughout the day as the home team strengthened their position. O'Reilly speculated that the tourists had become complacent because of their comfortable 20 series lead.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the innings, Bradman used off theory, but left a large gap square of the wicket in an attempt to coax England's out-of-form top-order to play risky shots into the {{inviting}} gap. However, Bradman's offer was spurned as Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously. Meanwhile, Australia's attack appeared unsettled. Bradman set defensive fields for most of the first day as England's openers put on 168 for the first wicket. O'Reilly said that Bradman's defensive field settings [...] "made the sorry admission of impotency". England's batsmen dominated to reach stumps at 2/268. Jack Fingleton said that Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and was its <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of bowling since the Second World War, citing the proliferation of full tosses. O'Reilly criticised the display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said that no bowler could be excused. He said that the attack [...] "functioned without objecthopelessly and meaninglessly" [...] throughout the day. He lambasted the bowlers for performing at a standard akin to county cricket. O'Reilly criticised the players for having a casual and lethargic manner, speculating that Bradman had been allowed them to become complacent.|$|E
500|$|Almost 250 {{different}} fires {{started in}} Yellowstone {{and the surrounding}} National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of the fires and later dubbed [...] "Black Saturday", more than [...] were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted {{as far away as}} Billings, Montana, [...] to the northeast.

He also said it was the first penalty shoot-out he had ever won as a manager: [...] "I won the Charity Shield that way, but that doesn't really count. The European Cup? The FA Cup? The Scottish cups? Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky — magnificent." [...] Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad. Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his relief at his side's shoot-out victory, saying, [...] "In my opinion I played well in the game, scored a goal, and then missed the penalty.
