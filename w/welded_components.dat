40|$|The {{behavior}} of crack growth {{with a view}} to fatigue damage accumulation on the tip of cracks is discussed. Fatigue life of <b>welded</b> <b>components</b> with initial crack in bridges under traffic loading is investigated. The study is presented in two parts. Firstly, a new model of fatigue crack growth for welded bridge member under traffic loading is presented. And the calculate method of the stress intensity factor necessary for evaluation of the fatigue life of welded bridge members with cracks is discussed. Based on the concept of continuum damage accumulated on the tip of fatigue cracks, the fatigue damage law suitable for steel bridge member under traffic loading is modified to consider the crack growth. The proposed fatigue crack growth can describe the relationship between the cracking count rate and the effective stress intensity factor. The proposed fatigue crack growth model is then applied to calculate the crack growth and the fatigue life of two types of <b>welded</b> <b>components</b> with fatigue experimental results. The stress intensity factors are modified by the factor of geometric shape for the <b>welded</b> <b>components</b> in order to reflect the influence of the welding type and geometry on the stress intensity factor.

Dissimilar metal welding refers to the joining of two materials from different alloy groups. One of the basic requirements of the dissimilar metal welded joint is that the joint strength should be {{greater than or equal}} to that of the weakest member and a careful characterisation of the joint is crucial before considering the applicability of the dissimilar metal <b>welded</b> <b>components.</b> The current paper explores the feasibility of an electron beam welded joint between ferritic/martensitic Grade 91 or more commonly known as modified P 91 and austenitic 316 LN stainless steel, without the addition of any filler material. The residual stress distribution arising from the welding is determined from measurements using neutron diffraction experiment and predictions using finite element analysis. The measured data has been analysed using Rietveld and single peak fits. The finite element analysis was conducted on a two-dimensional cross-sectional model using ABAQUS code, implementing the effects of solid-state phase transformation experienced by P 91 steel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of very narrow weld bead and highly strength overmatching on the fracture toughness of laser beam <b>welded</b> <b>components</b> are investigated. This study {{focuses on the}} difference of plastic constraint in fracture toughness specimen (3 -point bend specimen, 3 PB) and structural components with crack in the weld metal. The equivalent crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) ratio, β, for the correction of CTOD toughness for constraint loss in structural components is numerically analyzed. The narrowness of weld bead induces constraint loss by plastic deformation in the base metal, both the 3 PB and structural components. Nevertheless, {{in the case of}} the wide plate with shallow crack, the highly strength overmatching elevates the opening stress. Therefore, it is found that the β increase with increasing strength mismatch ratio. The influence of highly strength overmatching on β is important for assessment of fracture performance of laser beam welded component. The applicability of β to correction of critical CTOD in laser beam <b>welded</b> <b>components</b> is discussed. The fracture toughness tests with the 3 PB and tension panel (edge through-crack panel) of the laser beam welded joints were conducted at a low temperature in the brittle fracture range.

40|$|The {{most common}} method for {{relieving}} residual stresses is {{post weld heat}} treatment (PWHT). PWHT is used in cases where machining of <b>welded</b> <b>components</b> and castings with high residual stresses may result in undesired distortions. The beneficial influence of PWHT on fatigue is significant at negative R- values and low stress ranges. Compared to PWHT, vibrational stress relief (VSF) has the potention for significant advantages: reduction of cost, absence of scale, no metallurgical consequences etc. The aim of the present research was to determine the effectiveness of VSR compared to PWHT, especially for welded structures with repaired welds. In the investigations, several test series were carried out, where <b>welded</b> <b>components</b> indifferent fabrication states (as welded, vibrated after welding, heat treated after welding and preloaded after welding), were submitted to fatigue loading. It is found that due to the absence of sound and common accepted guidelines and quality criteria, the success of vibrational stress relief is quite uncertain. Furthermore, it is found that in fatigue loading, VSR probably has no significant beneficial effect. During the first load cycles, about the same "stress relief" occurs as during VSR. Only in case of very low stresses and low R-ratios, VSR may have any positive effect on the fatigue life of welded structures...|$|E
