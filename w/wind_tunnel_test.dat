25|$|However the {{purchasing}} of aircraft was curtailed as the Cold War {{came to an}} abrupt end in the 1990s. This curtailment in military procurements combined with the loss of the contracts for two major projects, the Advanced Tactical Fighter and Joint Strike Fighter, severely hurt McDonnell Douglas. McDonnell Douglas built only a small <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>test</b> model.|$|E
25|$|The inside facing of {{the tunnel}} is {{typically}} as smooth as possible, to reduce surface drag and turbulence that could impact {{the accuracy of the}} testing. Even smooth walls induce some drag into the airflow, and so the object being tested is usually kept near the center {{of the tunnel}}, with an empty buffer zone between the object and the tunnel walls. There are correction factors to relate <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>test</b> results to open-air results.|$|E
25|$|As can be seen, for λL = π/2 + nπ, with {{arbitrary}} {{integer number}} n, tan(λL) is infinite. n = 0 {{corresponds to the}} point of torsional divergence. For given structural parameters, this will correspond to a single value of free-stream velocity U. This is the torsional diverengence speed. Note that for some special boundary conditions that may be implemented in a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>test</b> of an airfoil (e.g., a torsional restraint positioned forward of the centre of lift) it is possible to eliminate the phenomenon of divergence altogether.|$|E

2500|$|The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center is {{the largest}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>test</b> section in the world. This open circuit leg was added and a new fan drive system was {{installed}} in the 1980s. The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel is used to support an active research program in aerodynamics, dynamics, model noise, and full-scale aircraft and their components. The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated, {{with an emphasis on}} estimating the accuracy of computational methods. Aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions are explored. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of models or aircraft undergoing investigation. Some of the test programs that have come through the 80 by 120 Foot include: F-18 High Angle of Attack Vehicle, DARPA/Lockheed Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, XV-15 Tilt Rotor, and Advance Recovery System Parafoil. The 80 by 120 foot test section is capable of testing a full size Boeing 737 at velocities up to [...]|$|E
