5|$|The {{conference at}} Calais was {{something}} of a political triumph, but even though the French government gave implicit support for Henry's remarriage and Francis I himself held private conference with Anne, the French King maintained alliances <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> which he could not explicitly defy.|$|E

5|$|Henry is {{best known}} for his six marriages and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled. His {{disagreement}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Despite his resulting excommunication, Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} restore the glory of his empire and to regaining superpower status. His foreign policy was both ambitious and expansive, reaching out to {{all corners of the}} Mediterranean world. He made several alliances <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> and Western Christian kingdoms, and successfully handled the passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade through his empire, establishing a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer.|$|E
5|$|Now King Henry VII, he neutralised the {{remaining}} Yorkist forces, partly by marrying Elizabeth of York, a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the {{conflicts with the}} nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end. The reign of the second Tudor king, Henry VIII, was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the Church of England (the Anglican Church).|$|E
50|$|The plot of <b>the</b> film begins <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope's</b> {{visit to}} Jerusalem, {{a stop on}} his 91st trip abroad, which {{occurred}} between 20 March and 26 March 2000.|$|R

[...] However, {{the other members of the}} College of Cardinals objected, and he was forced to return to Rome.|$|R
5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} {{over what he}} saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E
5|$|While the {{religious}} hierarchy mirrored the Empire's administrative divisions, the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor's servants. The issue of caesaropapism, while {{usually associated with}} the Byzantine Empire, is now understood to be an oversimplification of actual conditions in the Empire. By the fifth century, the Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized as first among equals of the four eastern Patriarchs and as of equal status <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Æthelhard {{resolved}} {{to go to}} Rome and consult <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> about the decline in power of the see of Canterbury. The archbishop went to Rome along with Bishop Cyneberht of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope. After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield back down to a bishopric. Besides these papal actions, {{there are indications that}} the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognised the elevation of Lichfield.|$|E
5000|$|In 1517, Archbishop Merino helped {{broker a}} deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope's</b> enemy Cardinal Alfonso Petrucci. [...] He was also {{instrumental}} in rallying Siena to the papal cause during the War of Urbino.|$|R

50|$|James Gordon {{carried on}} <b>the</b> Jesuit intrigue, <b>with</b> a mission from James VI to Rome, and {{returned}} to Scotland <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope's</b> legate, George Sampiretti. James later decided that the laws against Catholics should be enforced.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, the Archbishop of Toledo, Raymund, did attend. King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend. King Stephen of England refused permission {{for any of the}} English bishops to attend, except for the bishops of Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to attend the council.|$|E
5|$|HenryIII's reign was {{in crisis}} in 1258. He had {{recently}} suffered defeat in Wales, there were agricultural problems {{leading to a}} famine, and relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> were worsening. Discontent amongst England's magnates led Henry to promise reform, but under continued pressure his authority disintegrated. A royal council of fifteen magnates was formed in June that year, {{and the rule of}} the country transferred from the king to the council. With foreign help Henry's reign was restored in 1261 as the council were reluctant to start a civil war. Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, raised a rebellion. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to the king and the baronial forces led by de Montfort.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the main}} advisors of King John during the dispute <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of a mocking song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E

5|$|Letters backing John {{arrived from}} the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had {{organised}} into a military faction. They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on London, Lincoln, and Exeter. John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists. The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> as the supreme arbiter, {{but this was not}} attractive to the rebels. Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 1386 Corfu became {{once more}} a Venetian {{possession}} {{and this time}} Venetian rule would last {{until the end of}} the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu. On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors to submit to the Venetian senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu, the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> and Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E
5|$|Political {{conflict}} {{broke out}} across the Empire shortly after the marriage, triggered when Henry arrested his Chancellor Adalbert and various other German princes. Rebellions followed, accompanied by opposition from within the Church, which played {{an important part in}} administering the Empire, and this led to the formal excommunication of the Emperor by Pope Paschal II. Henry and Matilda marched over the Alps into Italy in early 1116, intent on settling matters permanently <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope.</b> Matilda was now playing a full part in the imperial government, sponsoring royal grants, dealing with petitioners and taking part in ceremonial occasions. The rest of the year was spent establishing control of northern Italy, and in early 1117 the pair advanced on Rome itself.|$|E

To the left are Girolamo Riario and Giuliano's brother Giovanni della Rovere on the left. Giuliano della Rovere was later to become Pope Julius II.|$|R
5000|$|Reception of “The Easter People” was {{overwhelmed}} by <b>the</b> decision by <b>Pope</b> John Paul II {{at about the same}} time to make the first ever papal visit to Britain. Combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope’s</b> own conservative policies, this ensured that “The Easter People” had only a very muted impact.|$|R
5|$|The {{removal of}} the eastern threat {{and the rise of}} the Byzantines' {{confidence}} also opened up opportunities in the west, where the Bulgarian ruler Boris (r. 852–889) had been negotiating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> and Louis the German (r. 817–876) for a possible conversion of himself and his pagan people to Christianity. This expansion of Rome's ecclesiastic influence up to Constantinople's very doorstep could not be tolerated by the Byzantine government. In 864, the victorious eastern armies were transferred to Europe and invaded Bulgaria, in a demonstration of military might that convinced Boris to accept Byzantine missionaries instead. Boris was baptized, taking the name Michael in honor of the Byzantine emperor, thus beginning the Christianization of Bulgaria and initiating the nation's absorption into the Byzantine-influenced, Eastern Orthodox world.|$|E
5|$|Upon his arrival, Vitalian {{was made}} magister militum in praesenti, named honorary consul, {{and soon after}} raised {{to the rank of}} patricius. As a {{well-known}} champion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Vitalian was {{to play a role in}} the new regime's reaffirmation of the Chalcedonian doctrines and reconciliation with Rome. He played an active role in the negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope,</b> and in 519, he was one of the prominent men who escorted a papal delegation into the capital. Vitalian also took vengeance on the staunchly Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch, Severus, who had celebrated Vitalian's defeat in his panegyric On Vitalian the tyrant and on the victory of the Christ-loving Anastasius the king: Justin ordered Severus's tongue to be cut, and Severus fled to Egypt along with Julian, Bishop of Halicarnassus.|$|E
5|$|Vitalian fled to {{his native}} Thrace and {{remained}} in hiding until Anastasius's death in 518. As a staunch promoter of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, he was pardoned by the new emperor Justin I (r. 518–527) and was engaged in the negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> to end the Acacian Schism. He was named consul for the year 520, but was murdered shortly after, probably on the orders of Justin's nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527–565), who saw in him a potential rival for the throne. His sons also became generals in the East Roman army.|$|E
25|$|Only <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{establishment}} of Guelph rule as dukes from 1070 by Henry IV {{was there a}} re-emergence of the Bavarian dukes.
