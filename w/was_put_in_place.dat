In 1927 Słowacki's remains were moved to Wawel Cathedral in Poland, but an empty grave still remains at Montmartre.|$|E
5|$|Among he restive {{regions of}} the new nation was the North-West Frontier Province. The {{referendum}} there. in July 1947 had been tainted by low electoral turnou,t as less than 10 {{percent of the population}} were allowed to vote. On 22 August 1947, just after a week of becoming governor general, Jinnah dissolved the elected government of Dr. Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan. Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated province despite his being a Kashmiri.

5|$|Before being {{exported}} {{from the}} district, all furs {{had to pass}} through depots manned by a quarantine officer appointed by the Board of Health. Any furs believed to have {{come into contact with}} parts of the district infected by smallpox were to be destroyed. This led to some problems for the Government of Canada after the Council was dissolved. Some people whose furs had been destroyed under these regulations applied to the Government for compensation, as no mechanism <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> when the Act was drafted. These claims for compensation were considered, but ultimately ignored.|$|E

5|$|Hifz-ur Rahman saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War in 18771878, where she {{operated}} on the Danube {{to try to}} prevent Russian forces from crossing the river. While defending the port of Sulina, she engaged Russian gunboats in an inconclusive action. She was laid up for twenty years, until the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the badly deteriorated state of the Ottoman fleet. A large-scale reconstruction program <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> and Hifz-ur Rahman was rebuilt in the Imperial Arsenal in the early 1890s. Nevertheless, she saw no further service of any significance, and she was sold for scrap in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In 1813, {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars, work {{was carried out}} to alter {{the design of the}} parapet. The Crimean War sparked a fresh {{invasion}} scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. Yarmouth Castle underwent considerable repairs that year; four naval guns and traversing rails were installed on the castle platform, and a regular county army unit <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> to garrison the fort. In 1881 a proposal was put forward to modernise the entire fortification, but this was rejected and in 1885 the garrison and the guns were withdrawn.|$|E

Once this was completed, Melbourne was removed while the new bow <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in the drydock; Melbourne was {{then returned to the}} drydock where her new bow was fitted. The work was eventually completed on 27 April, with the shipyard receiving a commendation.|$|E

Steam locomotives were temporarily banned from using the station, with Hastings Units being introduced into service earlier than planned. A full service was resumed from 6 May. Construction of a new signal box began on 19 April and it came into service on 16 December.|$|E

Batista refused to wrestle, citing his injuries, and as a result Hart awarded the match to his opponent Orton by forfeit. Following Hart's decision, Batista quit WWE.

5|$|The {{construction}} of {{the entrance to the}} Duomo of Salò is copiously documented between 1506 and 1509. The design was by Cairano, most likely in collaboration with Antonio Mangiacavalli. Cairano's hand is evident in the figures of the Father, St. Peter and St. John the Baptist, leaving the Virgin to his collaborator, while the Angel of the Annunciation and two small busts in the spandrels appear to be a joint work. The architectural parts were accomplished by different stonemasons as recorded in the documents relating to the workshops, including Mangiacavalli's son. The portal <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by August 1508, and embellishments and other work ended at the beginning of 1509.|$|E

Consequently, the seaward end of the pier was filled with fairground rides, including thrill rides, children's rides and roller coasters.

As a result, Orton punted DiBiase in the head, putting him out of action; this storyline <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in order for DiBiase {{to take time off}} to film The Marine 2. Orton then invited Rhodes and Manu to form a group with him called The Legacy, and used them to help in his rivalry with Batista leading to a three-on-two handicap match where Batista was put out of action for four months.|$|E
