500|$|The College Dropout diverged {{from the}} then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop {{in favor of}} more diverse, topical {{subjects}} for the lyrics. Throughout the album, West touches on a number of different issues drawn from his own experiences and observations, including organized religion, family, sexuality, excessive materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, and personal struggles. Music journalist Kelefa Sanneh wrote, [...] "Throughout the album, Mr. West taunts everyone who didn't believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap". West explained, [...] "My persona is that I'm the regular person. Just think about whatever you've been through in the past <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have a song about that on my album." [...] The album was musically notable for West's unique development of his [...] "chipmunk soul" [...] production style, in which R and soul music samples were sped up and pitch shifted.|$|E

But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E

500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} with the episode, stating, [...] "having {{set up an}} interesting cliffhanger last week, it was a tad annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory," [...] but also more annoyed [...] "that what exactly was going on here, {{and how it was}} influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks." [...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in this <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E
500|$|Limp Bizkit {{was leading}} ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., Sevendust among others. But some {{days before the}} event, Borland took to Instagram to express his discontent, posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading: [...] "Can't wait to see me some roided out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell-O shot filled bohunks do their best drunk MMA {{impressions}} in the top deck mosh pit." [...] Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying [...] "When I first read {{the description of the}} cruise I realised {{it is what it is}} and I thought I'd have some fun with it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit. I think that is going to happen though so I feel safe. I'm turning 40 next <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it's funny that I'm spending the last week of my [...] on ShipRocked.

500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E

[...] Commenting on his appointment to ED Man on a salary of £30,000 per annum, Straw said, [...] "There are 168 hours in the <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50.

The night before, he told the Swedish tabloid Expressen, [...] "I came to the decision last <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> informed our general manager, Ken Holland." [...] Discussing Lidström's retirement, former teammate Steve Yzerman described Lidström as [...] "one of the all-time best defencemen to ever play." [...] Paul Coffey said, [...] "he was an incredible player" [...] while Chris Chelios said, [...] "There's been guys who are great players, but no one's better than Nick. As good? Yes. But this {{is as big as}} it gets. He's one of the best athletes ever and...if you're going to talk about someone who's perfect, Nick's pretty darn close to being perfect." [...] Washington Capitals defenceman John Carlson described Lidström as [...] "one of the game's all-time greats on and off the ice." [...] Ken Holland stated his belief that Lidström was [...] "the most valuable player of his era." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, while {{preparing}} a recital program for her master's degree, Blackwell auditioned for the Broadway revival of West Side Story. Impressed with her audition, Leonard Bernstein hand picked {{her for the}} role of Francisca (formerly named Consuela in the original 1957 production) and the understudy for Maria in the 1980 revival. As Francisca, Blackwell sang the song Somewhere from the orchestra pit during the final scene of the musical. For the next two-and-a-half years she toured with the show, gaining skills no operatic training could have provided. Blackwell said, [...] "I learned about characterization, how you went about becoming that person", she said. [...] "I learned stamina, how to do eight shows a <b>week.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> learned to make the stage my home, where I felt 100 percent comfortable." [...] At the show's premiere, critics remarked how similar Blackwell sounded to opera singer Reri Grist who originated the role of Consuela. Coincidentally, Blackwell met and befriended Grist in 1985 when she coached Blackwell for her European debut as Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera with the Hamburg State Opera. She repeated that role the following year at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.|$|E

2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
