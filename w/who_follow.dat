5|$|There is a {{significant}} Deshashta population {{in the state of}} Karnataka, and here, the sub-classification of Deshastha Brahmins is based on the type of Hindu philosophical system they follow. These are the Deshastha Madhwa Brahmins <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the teachings of Madhvacharya and the Deshastha Smartha Brahmins <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the teachings of Adi Shankaracharya. The surnames of these North Kanataka based, Kannada speaking Deshastha Brahmins, can be identical to those of Maharashtrian Deshastha Brahmins, for example, they have last names like Kulkarni, Deshpande and Joshi. Intermarriages are allowed between the Karnatak Brahmans and the Deshasthas and so the classification of the Southern India Brahmans into the Maharashtra, the Andhra (Telugu) and the Karnatic are in this respect, more of a provincial or linguistic character than an ethnographic one.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E
5|$|The Kanaks {{were known}} to worship their ancestors. This worship was {{embodied}} in the sepulchre, sacred stones, and devotional hearths where they offered sacrifices. Today, most Kanaks are Christians. Religion is {{an important aspect of}} Kanaks' life. Kanaks attend the Catholic Church in Nouméa. and they form nearly 50% of the population of Catholics in New Caledonia, next only to the Europeans. Also, the majority of Protestants are Kanaks. However, there are a few <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> traditional beliefs.|$|E

Both of the couples are nearing the same clock tower where they died in their past lives. A worried Chaitanya is offered a lift by a young biker <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> them. On 10:20 AM when all the four are safe near the clock tower, a lorry driven by a drunk driver is shown rushing towards them. The biker and Chaitanya jump from the bike, which goes on to hit the lorry tyre, distracting the lorry's path. The four thank Chaitanya who urges them to thank the biker, Akhil.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two Republicans <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous Willie Horton and Revolving Door political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. Nixon had recently recovered from a cold, and sweated considerably throughout, something that was detrimental to the impression he made in the debate.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E

25|$|These {{differences}} {{reflect a}} general philosophical difference between Haredi Judaism, which emphasizes strict interpretations {{in order to}} prevent possible transgressions, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, which is more likely to utilize leniencies rooted in classical rabbinic sources. The difference has tended to increase the social distance between Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews, as Haredi Jews <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the stricter interpretation may find themselves unable to pray in some Modern Orthodox synagogues. As a result, and consistent with the general increasing influence of Haredi interpretations, many synagogues in recent years have raised the height of their mechitzot in order to accommodate members and guests <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> stricter interpretations.|$|E
