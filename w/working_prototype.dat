5|$|In April 2015 Polygon {{published}} an article describing the development process of Alan Wake 2 that started shortly after the first game released. Alan Wake 2 already had a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according to Sam Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else {{and development of the}} sequel has shifted to Quantum Break. Most of the ideas for Alan Wake 2 were implemented on American Nightmare. Like the game's location, the Arizona Desert.|$|E
5|$|When Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin was {{announced}} in November 2011, Oceaneering had already developed a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> of the ride vehicle. The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012: a circular ride vehicle, seating eight riders in two rows of four. On May 11, 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride's technology. At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo, SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the trackless, motion simulator-based ride vehicle to the public.|$|E
5|$|During {{the concept}} phase {{there were four}} people working on the Hitman Go. Initial prototypes were built on paper using printed out characters. The project was pitched and greenlit for {{production}} in mid 2013. Daniel Lutz served as creative director, and the team size peaked at eleven people throughout {{the remainder of the}} game's development. The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a low barrier of entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> and a basic level editor were developed in a few days and after two weeks the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E

40|$|We study a Schumpeterian {{model of}} long-run growth with {{endogenous}} fertility and with three interacting dimensions of innovation. Scientific {{research is the}} fundamental dimension of innovation that creates new technological knowledge. This is allocated over new <b>working</b> <b>prototypes</b> in the horizontal dimension. New firms finance scientific research by obtaining the property rights of new <b>working</b> <b>prototypes,</b> and existing firms invest in developing the blueprint mode of <b>working</b> <b>prototypes</b> into the more productive modes of production in the vertical dimension. Balanced growth in the standards of living is fully endogenous without scale effects, and a new parameter, i. e., the elasticity of scientific knowledge with respect to existing collective scientific knowledge, nonlinearly accelerates long-run growth. With exogenous population growth, the model generates a semi-endogenous result due to the endogenously determined bound on technological opportunity. ...|$|R
5|$|Finder No. 3, Mark IV, for the Army, but the Army {{cancelled}} {{the order}} in August 1941 when the prototype was nearly complete. In January 1942, he was seconded to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney to develop secret valves for a Radio Direction Finder. He teamed up with Eric Burhop to build a magnetron, producing a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> on 23 May 1942. He {{then went on to}} build an original magnetron that generated 25centimetre microwave radiation. These magnetrons were used in radar equipment by the Army, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Wishing to return to Melbourne, he stepped down as Deputy Chief of the Division of Radiophysics in January 1944, and took charge of the Valve Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{planning}} began {{for a new}} {{theme park}} adjacent to Universal Studios Florida. By the end of 1993, {{it was decided that}} one area of the future Islands of Adventure theme park would be themed after Marvel Comics, with a Hulk theme being selected for a thrill ride. The designers of the ride wanted to simulate being fired out of a cannon and subsequently set about prototyping a launch system. Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation had a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> in January 1995. Methods to achieve this acceleration were investigated into mid-1996. On-site construction of Islands of Adventure was underway in 1997, with Superior Rigging & Erection being responsible for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster. On May 28, 1999, Islands of Adventure officially opened to the public, with The Incredible Hulk being one of its debut attractions.|$|E
5|$|In {{additional}} to {{the technical}} limitations, Robinett had struggled with Atari's management over the game. Around {{the time of}} Adventures development, Atari, now owned by Warner Communications, had hired Ray Kassar as general manager of their Consumer Division, and he was later promoted to president and CEO of Atari in December 1978. Kassar interacted with the programmers rarely and generally treated their contributions with indifference. Robinett was initially discouraged from working on Adventure by his supervisor, George Simcock, who said the ambitious game could not be done based on knowing how much memory Colossal Cave Adventure used. When Robinett developed a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> within a month, the management at Atari were impressed, encouraging him to continue the game despite his supervisor's initial response. The management later tried to convince Robinett {{to make it a}} tie-in work for the upcoming Superman movie, which was owned by Warner Communication. Robinett remained committed to his initial idea. Instead, Atari had developer John Dunn offered to take Robinett's prototype source code to make the 1979 Superman game.|$|E

25|$|The {{design was}} {{conceived}} by German engineer Felix Wankel. Wankel received his first patent for the engine in 1929. He began {{development in the}} early 1950s at NSU, and completed a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> in 1957. NSU subsequently licensed the design to companies around the world, who have continually added improvements. The engines produced are of spark ignition, with compression ignition engines only in research projects.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, various {{possibilities}} {{were explored}} (including one early design for fixed carriages with tilting seats). A number of prototypes were built and tested, including an automotrice (self-propelled) derived from ALn 668 diesel car and provided with tilting seats. The first <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> using a tilting carbody was ETR Y 0160, an electrically powered car launched by FIAT in 1969. This {{was the first}} to be christened Pendolino.|$|E
25|$|While the Mk. XI was {{reaching}} its final design, the Navy {{learned of the}} Army's efforts to develop a synchronous bomb sight, and asked Norden to design one for them. Norden was initially unconvinced this was workable, but the Navy persisted, and offered him a development contract in June 1929. Norden retreated to his mother's house in Zurich and returned in 1930 with a <b>working</b> <b>prototype.</b> Lieutenant Frederick Entwistle, the Navy's chief of bombsight development, judged it revolutionary.|$|E

25|$|Glock {{became aware}} of the Austrian Army's planned procurement, and in 1982 {{assembled}} a team of Europe's leading handgun experts from military, police, and civilian sport-shooting circles to define the most desirable characteristics in a combat pistol. Within three months, Glock developed a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> that combined proven mechanisms and traits from previous pistol designs. In addition the plan was to make extensive use of synthetic materials and modern manufacturing technologies, to make it a very cost-effective candidate.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Graham Bell {{conceived}} {{the technical aspects}} of the telephone and invented it in July 1874, while residing with his parents at their farm in Tutela Heights, on the outskirts of Brantford, Ontario. He later refined its design at Brantford after producing his first <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> in Boston. Canada's first telephone factory, created by James Cowherd of Brantford, was a three-story brick building that soon started manufacturing telephones for the Bell System, leading to the city's style as The Telephone City.|$|E
25|$|With {{the basic}} idea outlined, Hayes and Sirkis gave Heatherington the go-ahead to build a {{prototype}} by adding a microcontroller to an otherwise lightly modified version of their existing 300 bit/s hardware. Sirkis was particularly interested in using the 1MHz PIC microcontroller, which were available for only US$1 a piece. After six months {{of trying to get}} the modem working with the PIC, Heatherington gave up and demanded they use the 8MHz Zilog Z8 instead, a US$10 part. Sirkis acquiesced, and a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> was soon complete.|$|E

25|$|Hellerâ€™s death {{prompted}} Mirowski {{to begin}} work on an implantable defibrillator for patients in need of continuous heart monitoring. In 1968, Mirowski, then {{the director of the}} Coronary Care Unit at Sinai Hospital, met Mower, the chief of medicine in the Coronary Care Unit. In 1973, Mirowski and Mower partnered with Heilman, the founder of Medrad, a medical device company, to develop a <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> of the implantable defibrillator. Alois Langer was also involved {{in the development of the}} AICD because he held extensive knowledge in the field of electrocardiograph signal analysis.|$|E
25|$|Voicemail is the {{managing}} of telephone messages from a centralized data storing system. Voicemail is stored on hard disk drives, media generally used by computers {{in order to}} store other forms of data. Messages are recorded in digitized natural human voice similar to how music is stored on a compact disc. To retrieve and to play back messages, a user calls the system from any phone, {{and his or her}} messages can be retrieved immediately. The first voicemail system, known as the Speech Filing System (SFS), was invented by Stephen J. Boies in 1973. What started as a research project at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, the first <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> became available to telephone users in 1975.|$|E
25|$|By April 2000, {{the first}} <b>working</b> <b>prototype</b> was rolled out, using a vehicle chassis {{adapted from a}} United Defense {{armoured}} chassis (the Universal Combat Vehicle Platform; UCVP) which includes components from the US M109 Paladin howitzer, M2 Bradley IFV & M8-AGS. The next 2 years saw the system undergo a series of comprehensive tests {{to ensure that the}} Primus was able to withstand the rigours that were required of it. As land in Singapore is scarce, firing tests were first done at the Waiouru Army Camp live-firing range in New Zealand as part of Exercise Thunder Warrior in February 2004. The guns have also participated in Exercise Wallaby at the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, Australia.|$|E
