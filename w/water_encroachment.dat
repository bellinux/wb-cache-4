50|$|Scientists {{studying}} {{the effects of}} global warming proposed in 2007 that sea <b>water</b> <b>encroachment</b> in the area could destabilize {{a significant portion of}} the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. A study in 2008 concluded that Totten Glacier is currently losing mass. A study published in 2015 concluded that Totten Glacier has the largest contribution of ice thinning rate on the East Antarctic continent, and that the thinning is driven by enhanced basal melting, because of ocean processes, and affected by polynya activity. Additionally, warm Circumpolar Deep Water has been observed during summer and winter months at the nearby continental shelf below 400 to 500 meters of cool Antarctic Surface Water. The deep water was observed entering beneath the glacier at the rate of 220,000 m3/s. The Totten Glacier is estimated to have a catchment area capable of generating a sea level rise of 3.5 meters in the event of a complete melt.|$|E

40|$|Smart wells {{refer to}} wells {{containing}} downhole sensors and inflow control valves (ICV) {{mounted on the}} production tubing. These wells allow the operator to record fluid flow rates, temperature and pressure incessantly. Recently, streaming potential measurement in smart wells has been proposed to monitor <b>water</b> <b>encroachment.</b> However, there are still significant uncertainties associated with {{the interpretation of the}} measurements, particularly concerning the streaming potential coupling coefficient. This is a key petrophysical property that dictates the magnitude of the streaming potential for a given fluid potential. Streaming potential magnitude is basically related to the fluid flow rate, fluid properties (particularly salinity), and the rock matrix properties. The coupling coefficient has been measured experimentally in sandstone cores saturated with different brine salinities, but very little works have been published on carbonate rocks. The huge number of carbonate reservoirs around the world suggests that measurement of streaming potential in carbonate rocks is also important. In this study, we present value of streaming potential coupling coefficient in a carbonate rock saturated with various salinities of brine. As we expected, streaming potential in such core is small but measurable and higher salinity gives smaller streaming potential coupling coefficient. Consistent results are obtained using specially designed electrodes and paired pumping experiments to eliminate spurious electrical potentials. We noticed that streaming potential coupling coefficient in carbonate rock is lower compared to the one in sandstone cores saturated with the same salinity of brine. This observation could be explained by comparing the difference in Point of zero charges (pzc) between those two types of rock. Qualitatively, the result suggests that measurements of streaming potential could be applied for monitoring <b>water</b> <b>encroachment</b> in carbonate reservoirs, in the same manner it is applied for sandstones reservoirs...|$|E

In the year 2002, due to the low productivity of the field, the company wanted to determine whether to keep operating, abandon or sell the field. So they asked Texas A&M University to perform the study, determine the oil potential, and make recommendations to improve production. Since no previous reservoir study was performed in this field, the original oil in place and {{the current status of}} depletion was unknown. Therefore a complete integrated study was needed in order to learn about the reservoir and evaluate it in a qualitative and quantitative manner, before making any recommendation. The current pay zone underlying the Jacob field forms a monocline structure composed of unconsolidated young clastic sediments deposited in the Eocene epoch of the stratigraphic column of the Nueces River Basin, mainly due to a fluvial deltaic system developed in south Texas. The original oil in place for this pay zone was estimated to be 18. 12 MMSTB and the cumulative production as of October 2003, 3. 8 MMSTB. The analysis of the production data available had shown that the pay zone is being flooded by a strong <b>water</b> <b>encroachment</b> from the lower sides of the structure.

Flood risk in urban areas are attributed to hazards accelerated by growth in terms of population, housing, paved-up areas, waste disposal, vehicles, water use, etc. all contributing to high intensity – high load of runoff. Reduced carrying capacity of drainage channels is also a key concern. Haphazard growth of low-income habitations and un-organised trade added to challenge.

Too low frequencies would compromise the electromagnetic wave propagation in favor of diffusion phenomena and too high frequencies would drastically attenuate the signal. In case of a relatively low conductive reservoir and a limited band of frequencies higher than 100 MHz we have defined the optimal imaging capacity of the radar system in the order of tens of meters.

From {{this point on}} it winds its way through this flat alluvial plain until it reaches the Persian Gulf some 40 km south of Abadan. Upon entering Khuzestan plain Karun enjoys a good drinking quality. However after passing {{through a number of}} cities and towns whose sewage flow directly into the river, uptake for irrigation, and after collecting drainage water from large sugar cane plantations, its quality deteriorates significantly. Agriculture is by far the biggest user of the Karun river, consuming around 10 billion m 3 per year. The returning drainage water from current agricultural projects account for 1. 3 billion cubic meter of Karun's water. The last two major cities on this river are the port cities of Khoramshahr and Abadan whose entire 1. 5 million population depends on this river for drinking water and their subsistence agriculture. The last decade of the 20 th century witnessed a big upsurge in the expansion of agricultural and industrial use of Karun water. A push for achieving self-sufficiency in sugar production meant that several large irrigation-drainage projects were hurriedly planned and executed in areas with highly saline soils and near surface, highly saline ground water. The drainage system from one such project, Amir Kabir, has a flow rate of 6 - 8 m 3 s- 1 and the EC of 45 to 70 dS/m. This practice, coupled with the drought of the last five years, meant that in the summer of 2000 river salinity in Khoramshahr and Abadan was so high that the water could no longer be used for drinking or even sanitary purposes. For the last 60 km of its route to Persian Gulf Karun is joined by the two Iraqi rivers of Euphrate and Tigris, thus forming a huge shipping waterway over which the two countries have gone to war a number of times. Excessive use of water by Iran and Iraq has reduced flow rate in this waterway to such extent that last year seawater entered Abadan's drinking <b>water.</b> Seawater <b>encroachment</b> has also put the future survival of the two country's huge date palm plantations on the banks of this shared waterway in jeopardy.
