Chamberlin became Deputy Chief of Staff in February 1946, and was briefly acting as Chief of Staff from 2 May to 10 June 1946. For his services in the Southwest Pacific and the Occupation of Japan, Chamberlin was awarded three Army Distinguished Service Medals and the Silver Star.

He commanded a F-86 squadron at Foster Air Force Base in Victoria, Texas and later headed the 450th Fighter-Day Wing, equipped with the F-100 Super Sabre. In 1956, he was transferred to the headquarters of the Far East Air Forces in Japan as chief of the fighter branch. During that tour of duty, he went to Taiwan to teach members of their air force about shooting down MiGs. He briefly returned to Texas as an advisor for the Air National Guard and on April 13–14, 1957 he was honored by the dedication of its new hangar at Ellington Field in Houston as [...] "The James P. Hagerstrom Air National Guard Facility". Later that spring, he moved to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> allies in the Pacific Air Forces. In Hawaii he earned a master's degree in economics and was promoted to the rank of colonel in March1959. He advocated for keeping guns on fighter jets instead of replacing them with air-to-air missiles like the AIM-9 Sidewinder, in disagreement with military leadership.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{remaining}} unenthusiastic {{with the}} script, Kanter agreed to commission it {{as a film}} {{on the condition that}} he reserve the right to select a [...] "" [...] director. Anderson would have selected David Lane, who had directed the two Thunderbirds film sequels, Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968). After a ten-week delay to filming, Robert Parrish, an American director whose latest project had been shelved, accepted the post. Parrish's film career up to 1968 had included co-editing Body and Soul (for which he had shared the 1947 Academy Award for Best Film Editing) and co-directing the 1967 James Bond spoof, Casino Royale. Anderson remembered Parrish as being [...] "very ingratiating", stating that he [...] "told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs up and we were in business." [...] Although the box office failure of Casino Royale had prompted Anderson to question Parrish's ability, he stated that Doppelgänger could not have been made without his recruitment: [...] "It wasn't a question of, 'Will we get on with him?' or, 'Is he the right man?' He was a name director, so we signed him up immediately." ...|$|E

Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, he appeared on BBC Breakfast with Frost, speaking to presenter Peter Sissons about his role. He praised the military campaign and went on to talk about the challenges of rebuilding the country, saying [...] "I think in relative terms we are not as badly off as me might have feared", but agreed that there were insufficient [...] "people on the ground" [...] to ensure security {{in the aftermath of the}} invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein's government. He was later deeply critical of the planning made for post-war Iraq, and stated that he attempted to raise the issue of insufficient planning with politicians. However, he was never [...] "overly concerned" [...] by warnings from aid agencies of a massive humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion which, in the event, never materialised, though he admitted he had been too optimistic about the state of the Iraqi infrastructure. In the Breakfast with Frost interview, he drew an analogy with London, [...] "if you imagine going into London and every Ministry building is completely empty of furniture, completely empty of people, most of the windows blown out, just trying to find the people who work in those Ministries, the equivalent of the Home Office and [...] out who worked there, getting them back to work, beginning to pay their salaries which we're now beginning to do, and encouraging them to come back and <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> is bound to take a bit of time." ...|$|E

A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly. The event shocked the entire band; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "his death really rocked us – it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed." [...] Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> made it all the more difficult to deal with." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton described it as [...] "a very sobering moment", saying, [...] "it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll. That your family, your friends and indeed the other members of the band – you don't know how much time you've got left with them." [...] Bono said, [...] "it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home." [...] He later commented, [...] "it brought gravitas to the recording of The Joshua Tree. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much." [...] Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the traditional Māori manner at Kai-iwi Marae near Whanganui, Carroll's hometown.

NGOs, including the Society for Protection of the Harbour, were formed to resist further attempts to reduce the size of the waterbody, with its chairman, Christine Loh, quoted as saying that the harbour [...] "...is a precious national asset and we must preserve it for future generations.

In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals.
