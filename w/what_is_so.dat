In June 2009, a non-political organization called the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation) was formed to manage the cultural center, in coordination with the local government. The center's inauguration was supposed to take place in March of that year, with President Michelle Bachelet Jeria in attendance; however, it was postponed until 27 January 2010.

500|$|The Fine Brothers are {{the creators}} of MyMusic, a sitcom show funded by YouTube's $100million {{original}} channel initiative. MyMusic features a main ensemble cast of Adam Busch, Chris Clowers, Jack Douglass, Tania Gunadi, Grace Helbig, Lainey Lipson, Jarrett Sleeper, Mychal Thompson and has featured many guest stars, with members of both Kids React and Teens React also appearing. The series has an interactive transmedia aspect, which the Fine Brothers have spoken on, saying [...] "To us, new media should be 'new' – and just not just a passive experience. The ability to create new storytelling elements and new ways to entertain audiences is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> motivating about being a creator at this time." [...] The show revolves around MyMusic, a company led by CEO Indie (portrayed by Adam Busch) who is portrayed as a stereotypical modern-day hipster. Another character on the show, Metal (portrayed by Jarrett Sleeper), {{is based on the}} brothers' teenage years. [...] "The Metal character comes directly from us when we were teenagers. We were metal heads, full-on," [...] as Fine stated. MyMusic has a separate channel on YouTube from the main Fine Brothers channel (MyMusicShow), which had over 381,000 subscribers and 28.9million video views as of July 7, 2013. MyMusic was nominated for nine Streamy Awards in the 3rd installment of the event, with three of the nominations going to the Fine Brothers. The second season premiered on August 20, 2013.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{met with}} [...] "a crackle of {{favorable}} reviews in major papers". The New Republic hailed it as [...] "an exceptional work", both [...] "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as [...] "a superb character writer", and the Denver Post {{called her a}} [...] "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's [...] "deft" [...] handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, The Guardian complaining that [...] "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that [...] "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed" [...] (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone {{gets in the way}} of plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel [...] "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader [...] "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that [...] "sex plays virtually no role in the story... one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The New Statesman reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as [...] "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen– or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." [...] However, she also criticised the book: [...] "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points.

500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Peng {{developed}} a personal dislike for Mao's {{efforts to promote}} his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect, infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time. In 1955–56 Peng {{was involved in a}} large number of efforts to moderate Mao's popular image, developing into a personal campaign. Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao's efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955 a draft copy of a book, The Military History of the PVA, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. In the preface of the book it was stated that [...] "the military victories of the PVA" [...] were won [...] "under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong": Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase [...] "and of Comrade Mao Zedong". In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao: Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum, saying: [...] "why take the trouble to put it up? What is put up now will be removed in the future." [...] When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted [...] "Long Live Chairman Mao!" [...] (literally [...] "10,000 years for Chairman Mao"), Peng addressed the soldiers, saying: [...] "You shout '10,000 years for Chairman Mao!' – does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He will not even live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!" [...] When one of Peng's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red (a song that idealizes Mao, which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution) be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, saying [...] "That is a personality cult! That is idealism!" [...] Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman, but Peng rejected them, saying: [...] "He is an old man, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> beautiful about him?" ...|$|E

Silas hits Heidi, who he mistakes for Lynsey, {{over the head with}} a brick, before strangling her to death. Silas is devastated when he realises that he has killed Heidi. The Daily Star had previously reported that Silas would kill Heidi, but this was not confirmed by Hollyoaks producers. Tiddy called the storyline [...] "fantastic" [...] and said the twist of Silas killing Heidi was [...] "great". Tiddy opined that Heidi's death would affect Silas, saying [...] "I think we'll see some remorse from him, as killing Heidi was a genuine mistake, and that's <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> great about the storyline.

2500|$|The Wildcats were {{successful}} on 22 of 28 field goal attempts in the game, for a shooting percentage of 78.6percent. The team made {{all but one}} of their 10 shot attempts in the second half. The Wildcats set NCAA Tournament championship game records for the highest shooting percentage and the fewest shot attempts; both figures are also records for any Final Four game as of 2015. Villanova made most of their free throw attempts, converting on 22 of 27 attempts. Georgetown made more than 50 percent of their shots as well, with 54 percent shooting (29 for 53). The Hoyas had 19 fewer free throw attempts than Villanova, although they {{were successful}} on six of their eight tries. The Wildcats committed 12 fouls in the game, and held Ewing without a free throw attempt.

2500|$|After Mill, critics {{focused on}} the ode's status among Wordsworth's other poems. In July 1877, Edward Dowden, in an article for the Contemporary Review, {{discussed}} the Transcendental Movement {{and the nature of}} the Romantic poets. when referring to Wordsworth and the ode, he claimed: [...] "Wordsworth in his later years lost, as he expresses it, courage, the spring-like hope and confidence which enables a man to advance joyously towards new discovery of truth. But the poet of 'Tintern Abbey' and the 'Ode on Intimations of Immortality' and the 'Prelude' is Wordsworth in his period of highest energy and imaginative light". Matthew Arnold, in his preface to an 1879 edition of Wordsworth's poetry, explains that he was a great lover of the poems. However, he explains why he believed that the ode was not one of the best: [...] "I have a warm admiration for Laodameia and for the great Ode; but if I am to tell the very truth, I find Laodameia not wholly free from something artificial, and the great Ode not wholly free from something declamatory." [...] His concern was over what he saw as the ideas expressed on childhood and maturity: [...] "Even the 'intimations' of the famous Ode, those corner-stones of the supposed philosophic system of Wordsworth... has itself not the character of poetic truth of the best kind; it has no real solidity" [...] "to say that universally this instinct is mighty in childhood, and tends to die away afterwards, is to say what is extremely doubtful... In general, we may say of these high instincts of early childhood... what Thucydides says of the early achievements of the Greek race:--'It is impossible to speak with certainty of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> remove; but from all that we can really investigate, I should say that they were no very great things.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was heavily {{criticized for being}} overly violent and graphic. Madonna's {{spokesperson}} {{said that there was}} a lot of violence because it tells the story of a woman who had probably been abused. Madonna also explained that her character was acting out a [...] "fantasy and doing things that girls are not allowed to do." [...] The video was received only early hours play on MTV. However, it was not the first time that Madonna had a video rejected for heavy rotation by MTV, since in 1990, the channel refused to show [...] "Justify My Love" [...] because of its steamy images, and in 1992 MTV only showed [...] "Erotica" [...] late at night. The decision to ban the video was a source of argument, since it appeared to be no more violent than some television shows that aired at the time. Ironically, the video went into heavy rotation on Oh! Oxygen and was streamed on America Online frequently. It was also later played frequently on VH1 Madonna programs, but in an edited format. According to Eden Miller of PopMatters, the reason why the video was possibly banned from MTV was due to the scene where it featured Madonna pointing a gun towards the police, as MTV had previously banned videos that contained guns. Miller explained that [...] "while Madonna is one of MTV's darlings, she's still a woman, and the idea of a woman taking her aggressions out on men is something the network can just not have. That's <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> disturbing [...] And that really is what it feels like for a girl."
