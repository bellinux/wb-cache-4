The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine {{the likelihood that a}} star will have planets. Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.|$|E

25|$|Mostly, {{a year is}} a {{leap year}} if it is evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that a year divisible by four is a leap year. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this leap year problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E

[...] Rick Bell of Country Standard Time stated, [...] "It's an impressive debut that, while she pines about lost love and Tim McGraw, <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> others singing the praises of Taylor Swift." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters praised the song, commenting it was [...] "good enough to recall {{some of the best}} country singles of recent years", such as [...] Rachel Proctor's [...] "Me and Emily" [...] and Julie Roberts's [...] "Break Down Here." [...] He complimented Swift's vocal abilities on the song, saying it was executed [...] "quite perfectly", something she was unable to carry throughout the album Taylor Swift.

On one hand, this is arguably the most mechanically sound sports game on the market and the gameplay improvements that Visual Concepts made are downright superb. The issue here lies with the decision to make Livin ‘Da Dream the focus and backbone of MyCareer falling flat. There are some moments throughout Spike Lee’s in-game film that might bring a smile to your face, but this story doesn’t lend itself to this franchise’s gameplay or the video game medium itself. Yes, basketball fans <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> a great time playing NBA 2K16 for hours on end, but there are too many small steps back here that can’t be ignored.

2500|$|... (6) Time {{trouble is}} another {{consideration}} noted by various authors, including Webb himself. This has two aspects; the more obvious is exploiting the opponent's time pressure to perpetrate a swindle. Ali Mortazavi observes that [...] "when {{the clock is}} ticking and time is pressing, a player's intuition is most likely to let him down, and this is where the swindler will get his opportunity." [...] He writes, [...] "It is of the utmost importance that the swindler conducts himself in the appropriate fashion when his opponent is in time trouble." [...] This includes calmly reflecting rather than rushing one's moves. GM Pal Benko notes that it is unpleasant for the player in time trouble to have to wait at the board, without daring even to get up to get a drink of water; this also makes the player in time trouble impatient, interferes with his concentration, and may cause him to mix up his planned responses. Mortazavi also advocates that, in general, one should avoid playing the most obvious moves (one-move traps, obvious pawn breaks, checks, etc.), since the player in time trouble <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> analyzed and have responses ready for them.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was much}} {{debate about the}} Coliseum's {{potential}} to be a modern NFL venue. Although the Coliseum has significant historical value, it is regarded by some as inadequate to be the home of a major professional sports team. Since it was designed and built long before the age of club seats, luxury boxes, and the other revenue-generating amenities that modern football stadiums possess, any professional team moving to the Coliseum <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> to perform extensive renovations. Also, its status as a National Historic Landmark means any renovations would have to be complementary to the most identifiable parts of the building, a guideline that was not followed during Soldier Field's renovations in 2002. Soldier Field was stripped of its landmark status {{as a result of its}} renovation. Los Angeles County voters have been generally uninterested in appropriating tax revenue toward building a new stadium. Without public funds, the costs of renovation would have to be borne by any future tenant of the Coliseum. Because of the difficulties that the NFL had with trying to finance a renovated Coliseum, Rose Bowl or until 2016 a brand new stadium, pro football was absent from the second-largest media market in the United States for two decades. (The NFL was to award a franchise to Los Angeles in 2002, but debate over a stadium, coupled with Houston's aggressiveness, led the NFL to award the franchise to Houston instead.) ...|$|E

IGN gave it a 7.5 out of 10, noting that [...] "everyone should see this movie". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal gave high encomium to Kranz's performance, expressing that the actor [...] "portrays Claudio with affecting passion", and says of the film, [...] "The joyous spirit of the play has been preserved in this modest, homegrown production". Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers wrote that the film was [...] "an irresistible blend of mirth and malice". Justin Chang of Variety sensed that the black-and-white evoked a [...] "timeless romanticism", which was additionally enhanced by the [...] "lightly applied score".

[...] Smith later added, [...] "Beyond is tepid when it’s trying to be emotional, moronic when it’s trying to be thrilling and unfunny when it’s trying to be non-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module: Things just click into place when needed, as when Kirk commands Scotty to rev up a busted old spaceship, Scott says it’s impossible, and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip." [...] James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave 2½ stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one; The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn’t unexpected; it’s Lin’s trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it’s also instantly forgettable."
