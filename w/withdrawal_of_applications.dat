50|$|Three {{blocks of}} 1.25 MHz {{frequency}} {{each in the}} 800 MHz band were also available for auction. Initially, only Videocon Telecommunications Limited and Tata Teleservices (Tata DoCoMo CDMA) had applied {{to participate in the}} auction for spectrum in 800 MHz band (CDMA). Both companies withdrew their applications before 5 November, the last date for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications.</b> Videocon was announced as a pre-qualifier in the bidding process by the DoT on 29 October, but withdrew its application on 2 November. Tata Teleservices was also announced as a pre-qualifier on 29 October, but withdrew its bid later. The withdrawals meant that there were no bidders left and the CDMA spectrum auction was subsequently cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|The United States House of Representatives {{passed the}} bill on February 28, 2007 {{by a vote}} of 423 to 0. The United States Senate passed their version of the bill on June 29, 2007 by {{unanimous}} consent.

Impetus for reform first began, however, when the China National Offshore Oil Corporation publicly announced an interest in UNOCAL in 2005, and even earlier that same year, when a GAO report revealed the lack of Congressional oversight {{and the degree to which}} some CFIUS transactions were escaping formal investigation through <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications,</b> among other things.|$|E
40|$|Grahame Boocock and Margaret Woods are Lecturers in Banking and Finance, and Financial Management, {{respectively}} at Loughborough University Business School, England. The paper {{examines how}} venture fund managers select their investee companies, by exploring the evaluation criteria {{and the decision}} making process adopted at one UK Regional Venture Fund (henceforth {{referred to as the}} Fund). The analysis confirms that relatively consistent evaluation criteria are applied across the industry and corroborates previous models which suggest that venture capitalists’ decision making consists of several stages. With the benefit of access to the Fund’s internal records, however, this paper adds to the current literature by differentiating the evaluation criteria used at each successive stage of the decision-making process. The paper presents a model of the Fund’s activities which demonstrates that the relative importance attached to the evaluation criteria changes as applications are systematically processed. Proposals have to satisfy different criteria at each stage of the decision-making process before they receive funding. In the vast majority of cases, applications are rejected by the fund managers. In addition, the length of time taken by the fund managers in appraising propositions can lead to the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> at an advanced stage...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} at a designated port of entry, the applicant must depart immediately.

5000|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} {{applies only to}} Arriving Aliens who present themselves {{for admission}} at a port of entry, whereas voluntary return applies to people apprehended or stopped at a land border. In particular, the offices within CBP that handle these are different: <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission is handled by the CBP Office of Field Operations whereas voluntary returns are handled by United States Border Patrol.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} {{is an option}} that U.S. Department of Homeland Security might offer to an Arriving Alien whereby the alien chooses to withdraw his or her application to enter the United States, and immediately departs the United States. Unlike an order of removal (including expedited removal as well as orders obtained {{as a result of}} removal proceedings), a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> {{for admission}} does not create a bar to future entry.|$|R

5000|$|For {{people who}} are not United States Lawful Permanent Residents, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} is officially noted on Form I-275, <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Application</b> for Admission/Consular Notification. The Form I-275 has two pages. The first page includes the alien's biographical information and the reasons why the application would have been denied. The second page includes a signed statement by the alien acknowledging that he or she has read the reasons the application would be denied, and is choosing to withdraw the application.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} {{is an alternative}} to expedited removal (when carried out by CBP) or removal proceedings (when {{carried out by the}} Immigration Judge). Whereas <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> {{for admission}} requires the consent of both the authorities (CBP or the Immigration Judge) and the alien, expedited removal does not require the alien's consent. An alien who refuses to withdraw the application for admission may instead be subject to expedited removal (by the CBP) or removal through an order by the Immigration Judge.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{inspection}} at {{a designated}} port of entry, from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This {{is the most}} common use <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{humanitarian}} {{or public}} interest considerations: Such considerations, where applicable, may lead CBP {{to be more}} willing to allow a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission than it otherwise would.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} {{is carried out}} through the issuing of immigration forms (I-275, etc.) whereas voluntary return requires no signed statement and in general involves less formality.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission/consular notification: Here, the {{applicant}} withdraws the application {{to enter the}} United States. If the entry was visa-based, the corresponding visa {{may or may not}} be canceled, depending on the specifics.|$|R
50|$|For Lawful Permanent Residents seeking {{re-entry}}, the LPR may {{be denied}} re-entry due to living outside the United States {{for over a}} year, or due to criminal activity that makes him or her inadmissible. In the case of LPRs who are being denied re-entry solely on account of living outside the United States for long but do not otherwise have any blemish on their immigration record, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission is usually offered as an option, both by CBP and by the Immigration Judge. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission is entered on Form I-407, along with a Voluntary Relinquishing of Permanent Residence.|$|R
50|$|An alien who {{receives}} {{an order of}} removal is subject to a re-entry bar that may be five, ten, or twenty years depending on the circumstances. In contrast, there are no re-entry bars in case <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission.|$|R
5000|$|The option <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} {{is offered by}} CBP {{at the discretion of}} the officers involved.

50|$|Voluntary {{departure}} {{should also}} {{not be confused}} with <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission, that occurs when an Arriving Alien who would be denied entry at a port of entry or deferred inspection site is asked to withdraw his or her <b>application</b> instead <b>of</b> receiving an order of removal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} is typically granted only {{in cases where}} the CBP officer involved genuinely believes that the alien did not engage in misrepresentation or try to break the law or conceal information, but voluntary return may be granted even in cases where it is believed that the applicant may have been trying to violate immigration law.|$|R
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} <b>of</b> a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> {{for admission}} {{is that it}} constitutes consent on the alien's part to the charges made in the Form I-275, and therefore {{makes it harder for}} the alien to challenge or appeal the finding. Expedited removal orders can be challenged with the CBP (though not appealed) and the findings of removal proceedings allow for appeals with the Board of Immigration Appeals.|$|R
5000|$|Matter of Gutierrez (1988) {{clarified}} {{that the}} alien needed {{to demonstrate to}} the IJ {{that he or she}} would immediately depart the United States {{in order to be able}} to withdraw the application. It also clarified that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission should not be construed as a form of relief from removal. Further, if excludability (now called inadmissibility) were established, the approval of the INS (now the U.S. Department of Homeland Security) was needed to allow withdrawal.|$|R
5000|$|The alien {{is found}} inadmissible: The officer may discretionarily allow the alien to {{withdraw}} the application for admission, to which the alien {{may or may not}} consent. The officer may also issue an order of expedited removal against the alien, or put the alien through removal proceedings. In the case <b>of</b> a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission or order of expedited removal, the original Form I-259 issued at the port of entry can be used to compel the alien's carrier to return the alien.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} and voluntary return, voluntary departure requires the alien {{to leave the}} United States, but does not put a removal order on the alien's record, thereby avoiding the bars to entry that a removal order would create. However, voluntary departure differs from the other processes in that its scope is not merely limited to arriving aliens. It can also apply to aliens who were admitted to the United States lawfully or entered unlawfully. Any days of unlawful presence acquired are not removed if the alien undergoes voluntary departure.|$|R
50|$|On March 24, 2015 Gogebic Taconite {{withdrew the}} preapplication notice {{related to the}} {{proposed}} mine.The site was closed during the application period to the public.

50|$|In summary, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} {{is suitable for}} cases where an alien may have innocently or through ignorance, misinformation, or bad advice, obtained an inappropriate visa but has not concealed the true purpose of the trip. For instance, an alien who entered on a visa whose expiration date is not yet reached, but {{that is no longer}} valid because the underlying status is now void, may be asked to withdraw the application {{for admission}}. For lawful permanent residents, the option to withdraw the application for admission may be offered in cases where the LPR appears to be inadmissible on account of having been outside the United States {{for a long period of}} time.|$|R
50|$|In cases <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for {{admission}} using an entry visa, the visa remains intact where {{the reason for}} inadmissibility does not extend to invalidating the visa. An example {{would be if the}} alien simply forgot to bring along all the necessary documentation while traveling but has it at home. On the other hand, if the reason for inadmissibility also implies that the visa should not be issued, the visa is invalidated and the applicant needs to apply for a visa again with the consulate. Regardless of whether the visa is invalidated, the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> {{for admission}} does not directly invalidate any underlying USCIS application or petition (such as Form I-129 or Form I-130), or other form (such as Form I-20 for students) that was a prerequisite to obtaining the visa.|$|R
