50|$|The Ever Victorious Army {{numbered}} around 5,000 {{soldiers at}} its height. It often defeated rebel forces which were numerically much larger {{because it was}} better armed, better commanded, and better trained. It was the first Chinese army to incorporate western style training and tactics, modern weaponry, and most important, the concept of light fast moving infantry units which could move faster than their opponents. Though Gordon has received most {{of the credit for}} the victories, it was Ward who originated the concepts that resulted in the Ever Victorious Army, and its ability to win those victories for Gordon. In recent years, there has been an effort to pay tribute to the man who molded the Ever Victorious Army, <b>Ward,</b> <b>aided</b> by Li Hongzhang, rather than Gordon.|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} is to develop an {{economic}} valuation comparing ketorolac vs. morphine for the treatment of sharp pain caused by heavy limb injury, in traumatology ward and in first <b>aid</b> <b>ward.</b> As cost minimization analysis, this economic valuation has been based on clinical results of Rainer et al. (2000). Ketorolac and morphine have the same efficacy in calming the pain; the greatest difference in the clinical outcomes is about the morphine side effects (nausea, vomiting and phlebitis). Assuming the hospital point of view with a differential costs perspective, the ketorolac patients showed two consequences than could generate lower resources consumption: less side effects and the reduction of time permanence in first <b>aid</b> <b>ward.</b> Considering the drug cost, the administration cost and the side effects treatment costs, the expenditure for every single morphine patient is L. 23. 385, vs L. 4. 875 for a ketorolac patient, with a difference of L. 18. 510...|$|R
50|$|The Latins did {{not attack}} the castle head on; rather, they began a {{prolonged}} siege, {{in order to}} tire the defenders. By surrounding the city with siege machinery and digging mines under the walls, they greatly weakened the defences and patiently waited for an opening. The main forces of Latin knights created well-structured guarded camps around the city to spot and <b>ward</b> off any <b>aid</b> that may have come. In front of each gate of the castle walls a unit was placed, which notably included a Venetian contingent led by Doge Enrico Dandolo.|$|R
50|$|Stewart Ward {{appears as}} a Senator in Peter Parker: Spider-Man vol. 2 #4 (April 1999), with {{frequent}} appearances {{in this and the}} concurrent The Amazing Spider-Man title throughout Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #24. Mysterious and seemingly up to no good, Ward lurked behind the scenes of the title until he ran afoul of Dr. Octopus and the Sinister Six. Ward reappeared a few issues later, and his backstory and connections to Spider-Man ally Arthur Stacy and the mysterious Ranger were revealed in a storyline running Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2. A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent operating as Sentry, Ward was as a double agent for Z'Nox aliens, who used <b>Ward</b> to <b>aid</b> in an invasion of Earth. Years later, as Z'Nox aliens found themselves on Earth during a brief period when it was designated an intergalactic prison, Ward was infected by Z'Nox lifeform, mutating him into a half-human/half-alien being.

40|$|Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at {{high risk}} of {{nosocomial}} infection as they frequently perform medical procedures on infectious patients that may generate bioaerosols. For example, emergency endotracheal intubations for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. Due to the high zonal bioaerosol concentration close to infection sources (e. g. patient's breathing zone) local exhaust ventilation (LEV) has been identified as a practical solution to reduce the bioaerosol concentration in hospital wards. In this study, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models have been developed to simulate the transport of infectious droplets and bioaerosols in a hospital <b>ward</b> to <b>aid</b> the design and control of a LEV system. This paper reports the details of the CFD mathematical models as well as the analyses of the distribution and suspension time of droplets and bioaerosols with respect to their size, emission direction, and emission speed. It is shown that the operation of a well-designed LEV system can effectively remove infectious droplets and bioaerosols from the breathing zone of a HCW.

50|$|The book is {{a seminal}} {{introduction}} to anarchism but differs considerably to others by concentrating {{on the possibility of}} an anarchism rooted in everyday experience, and not necessarily linked to industrial and political struggles. His ideas are heavily influenced by Peter Kropotkin and his concept of Mutual <b>Aid.</b> <b>Ward</b> bases his text on evidence from sociology, anthropology, cybernetics, industrial psychology, and from the experience of housing, town planning, education, work, play and social welfare. Ward argues for anarchist alternatives to the universal governmental and hierarchical systems of social organisation. This bucks a number of conventional trends of the socialist left, because he is quite critical of the welfare state.|$|R

Doggett's lawyer encourages her to evangelize to Chapman instead and this leads to Chapman 'converting' but then refusing to be baptized. Doggett sees this as disrespectful and expresses a wish to kill Chapman. The two have a confrontation {{at the end of the}} season's final episode. Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv made from a wooden cross; Chapman throws Doggett to the ground and hits her repeatedly.|$|R

40|$|Negative {{pressure}} isolation wards {{are essential}} infection control facilities against airborne transmissible diseases. Airborne infectious particles {{are supposed to}} be contained in the isolation room. However, negative pressure may break down by door-opening action or by human movement. Understanding the interzonal transport of airborne infectious particles in the isolation <b>wards</b> can <b>aid</b> the design and operation strategy of isolation facilities. In this work, the interzonal migration of airborne infectious particles by human movement was studied experimentally in an isolation ward. Artificial saliva solution with benign E. coli bacteria was aerosolized to simulate bacterium-laden infectious particles. The interzonal migration of aerosolized bacteria was characterized by biological air sampling. Less than 1 % of airborne infectious particles were transported to the higher pressure zone when door was closed. With human movement, 2. 7 % of the particles were transported from the anteroom to the corridor. From high-to-low pressure zones, as much as 20. 7 % of airborne infectious particles were migrated. Only a minimal amount of particles was transported from the corridor to the positive pressure nurses' station. Infection risk of tuberculosis of the healthcare workers and other occupants in the isolation wards were also assessed based on the measured migration ratios...|$|R
40|$|Background Recording and {{monitoring}} of vital signs {{is an important}} part of nursing care in the acute setting. Paper based Early warning scoring charts are inundated with mistakes such as incorrect addition of scores, incomplete charts and infrequent observations being carried out. Electronic early warning scoring system reduce the amount of incomplete charts and decrease patient mortality however, there is some conflicting results in relation to the technology. As nurses are the principal users the implementation phase and the user experiences are two key aspects to ensuring the early warning system is used effectively to improving patient. The aim of this research is to understand the nurseâs experiences using electronic early warning scoring system in a general ward Design A Qualitative approach (hermeneutic phenomenological) to generate rich data about nurses experiences. Methods Using a purposeful sampling technique data will be collected by interviewing 10 - 12 nurses on the ward that use electronic early warning scoring system on their ward. Implications for Practice Data obtained from the proposed study will add to nursing literature in relation to experiences of adopting new technology into a clinical <b>ward.</b> This will <b>aid</b> the future implementation of a EWS system in a ward environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores technology's pivotal {{position}} {{at the intersection of}} control and uncertainty. It examines two areas: Intensive Care and a Labour Ward. Building on the work of Davis (1960), it argues that certainty and uncertainty are socially constructable and reconstructable. This is actively achieved by the deployment of strategies involving particular paradigms (the biomedical model) and artefacts (medical technology). Power lies in control over knowledge and the structures and practices which sustain it, including those embedded in advanced technology. The contribution of medical technology to the achievement of certainty in Intensive Care and end-game Obstetrics (the Labour Ward) is considered. Achieved certainty in medical situations is seen as: the structured masking of uncertainty by the application of medical iconography, artefacts and techniques to create the illusion of certainty. The accomplishment of uncertainty in Obstetrics (as a precursor to technological intervention) is also explored. The accomplishment of uncertainty in medical situations is seen as associated with the structured projection of uncertainty, involving using medical discourse rooted in the medical paradigm to exaggerate the generality of risk and the probability of pathology. It is argued that the highly structured and routinised settings of ICU and the labour <b>Ward,</b> not only <b>aid</b> control by the medical profession but diminish perceptions of uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} agricultural credit utilization among small-scale women farmers in selected wards of Bida Local Government Area of Niger State. The specific objectives were to examine small-scale women farmers, {{to identify the}} major sources of credit to small-scale farmers and to determine the benefit (if any) which small-scale women farmers had derived after acquiring credit for their farm operations. Data were collected from one hundred respondents randomly selected from five <b>wards</b> with the <b>aid</b> of interview schedule administered by the researchers. Statistical tools used for data analysis were parentages, frequency distribution and student t-test. Up to fifty-six percent (56 %) of the respondents claimed that they obtained their credit from various sources for their farm operations. The results show that t-calculated (17581) was greater than t-critical (1. 9842) at 1 % level of significance. Similarly, a total of 47 % of the respondents opined that their farm produce increased their income which ranged between N 31, 000 - â N 40, 000 after acquiring credit from the Cooperative Bank. It was concluded that small-scale women farmersâ income had increased when they had credit facilities from banks Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} banks are monitored regularly to disburse agricultural loan to women farmers at the appropriate planning season with reasonable interest charge and that extension agents should ensure that the loan is utilized for only agricultural purposes...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{main problem}} in {{emergency}} medicine is that clinical assessment and treatment decisions are complex activities. Moreover, clinicians {{operate in a}} culture of personal responsibility for decisions, by {{making it difficult to}} accept automated systems as the primary decision route. In this paper we present the initial outcomes of the TESTMED project, which aims at developing a process-aware system where the emphasis relies on assisting the clinicians through the availability of recommended healthcare pathways, together with the provision of relevant information that reduce the risk arising from a personal decision The TESTMED project aims at finding an effective way for the clinicians to exploit the guidelines and to acquire, by reading or listening, the guideline itself and to make effective use of it. Moreover TESTMED prototype is able to trace and monitor every choice originated during the guideline execution. Methods: The doctor in charge of handling an incoming patient is equipped with a tablet PC. According to a patient-centered clinical approach, the care pathway is selected on a per-case basis from a dedicated repository and loaded into the back-end management system to be executed. The user interface relies on an integrated multitouch and speech recognition/generation framework, able to handle both touch and vocal inputs, and to support device-to-human interaction via text-to-speech capabilities. The first tests have concerned the guideline enacted for patients suffering from chest pain. Leveraging the encouraging results of our initial tests, we plan to perform in the next months an extensive system evaluation and validation. This will require the enactment of additional guidelines, as well as the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data for assessing the real impact on clinical work practices. Results: We produced two mockups of the system (in the months of April and September 2011) and a working prototype in late November 2011. Each mockup/prototype has been evaluated throughout a wide range of usability tests made with real clinicians, and the outcomes have been used for an incremental improvement of the system. Concerning the current version of the TESTMED prototype, we performed a test in the ward of DEA with 7 different users and with the Chest Pain procedure loaded into the system. Discussion and Conclusions: We can argue that so far main research activities have focused on supporting guidelines modeling and process management in static and well defined clinical contexts. Specific research activities have been carried out in the context of emergency <b>wards</b> and first <b>aid</b> environments. Preliminary evaluation results show a good degree of acceptance among medical staff members, and performance results confirm the feasibility and potential applicability of multimodal interfaces. The rest of the project will be devoted to the engineering of the prototype and to an extensive validation process...|$|R
