25|$|In October 2013, a {{male and}} female agent pretended to have a lovers' quarrel near where he {{was working at the}} Glen Park branch. According to Business Insider Ulbricht was distracted and got up to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was,</b> whereupon the female agent grabbed his laptop while the male agent {{restrained}} Ulbricht. The female agent was then able to insert a flash drive in one of the laptop's USB ports, with software that copied key files. According to Joshuah Bearman of Wired, a third agent grabbed the laptop while Ulbricht was distracted by the apparent lovers' fight and handed it to agent Tom Kiernan.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for {{southern}} Brooklyn, caught {{the case that}} made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one summer morning near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly drifted off the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was.</b> He found her moaning, with her head slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died {{a short time later}} at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on the side of her head that turned out to have been caused by a bullet.|$|E
25|$|For the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Cathy Freeman {{walked across}} a {{circular}} {{pool of water}} and ignited the cauldron through the water, surrounding herself within a ring of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp {{to the top of}} the stadium. When it was discovered <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was,</b> the program was overridden and the cauldron continued up the ramp, where it finally rested on a tall silver pedestal.|$|E

Sandy and Patrick arrive at the Krusty Krab where customers have gathered, angered about not getting their orders, Sandy then shows the note from SpongeBob to Mr. Krabs. After he reads it, they all become upset about making him leave (except for Squidward who is happy about SpongeBob being gone). Mr. Krabs has the customers leave the restaurant, so that he and the other can decide on how to find SpongeBob.|$|E
500|$|Khánh had not divulged that angry discussions had {{occurred}} in private, so Deepe was unsure what had happened between Taylor and Khánh to provoke such an outburst. She contacted the US Embassy to ask what the dispute was about. At first, the Americans defended Taylor without referring to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was,</b> stating: [...] "Ambassador Taylor has undertaken no activities which can be considered improper in any way...All his activities are designed to serve {{the best interests of}} both Vietnam and the United States." [...] The State Department issued a statement later in the day in more robust terms, saying [...] "Ambassador Taylor has been acting throughout with the full support of the U.S. government...a duly constituted government exercising full power...without improper interference...is the essential condition for the successful prosecution of the effort to defeat the Viet Cong." [...] The following day, Secretary of State Dean Rusk said aid would have to be cut, as the programs being funded needed an effective government to be useful. Taylor later responded by calling the generals' actions an [...] "improper interference" [...] into the purview of civilian government.|$|E
500|$|While other [...] "new magazines—and {{many of the}} old—are {{dying of}} {{literary}} cirrhosis. The cause? Poisoning due to decayed fiction", Gold stated, Galaxy was profitable within five issues; an [...] "incredible" [...] achievement, in his words. The outbreak of the Korean War led to paper shortages—Gold wrote in a 1951 editorial that [...] "buying paper these days is like being mugged on a dark street"—that forced the magazine {{to find a new}} printer, Robert M. Guinn. The new paper was of even lower quality, a disappointment to Gold. That summer, disagreements within World Editions led to attempts to disrupt Galaxys distribution. According to Gold, the circulation director {{and the head of the}} American office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them, and made sure that the ones that did get distributed went to areas of the United States, such as the South, where there was little or no audience for the magazine. [...] The head of the French office of World Editions came to the United States to find out <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was,</b> and recommended that the magazine be sold to the two Americans, for $3,000—a very low price. [...] They tried to recruit Gold, but he contacted the Italian office, which rejected the sale and eventually agreed to sell Galaxy to the printer, Robert M. Guinn. It was only after the sale was complete that the sabotaged distribution came to light; World Editions wanted to buy back the magazine, but Guinn quoted a price four times as high as he had paid. [...] In Gold's words, [...] "he, Guinn, knew what he was buying, whereas World Editions hadn't known what they were selling".|$|E

2500|$|On sol [...] (January 24, 2004) {{the rover}} repair team {{announced}} that the problem was with Spirits flash memory and the software that wrote to it.

NASA engineers finally {{came to the conclusion that}} there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data.

Barbaro arrived at Olean High School at approximately 2:50p.m. After leaving his car, he entered the school building through an opened side entrance and proceeded to the third floor where he set off a coke bottle filled with gasoline and a wick. Unable to open the locked door to the student council room, Barbaro shot off the lock, entered the student council room, and tied the door shut. A 12-man custodial crew was doing routine maintenance {{in the basement of the}} school at this time. When they heard a fire alarm sound, the superintendent dispatched Earl Metcaff to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> at the 3rd floor. [...] He met Joe Kosidlo, the 3rd floor custodian, who asked him to vacate because he thought he heard gun shots. [...] Mr. Metcaff did not listen and proceeded to where he heard the noise. Anthony Barbaro was then confronted by Earl Metcaff, seeing Metcalf through the glass window of the student council room, he opened his door shot and killed him. Barbaro then positioned himself in the student council room on the third floor of the school. There, he began shooting at people outside of the school.|$|E
