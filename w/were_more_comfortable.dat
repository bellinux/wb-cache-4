5|$|Most of {{the first}} Marshalsea, as with the second, was taken up by debtors; in 1773 debtors within 12 miles of Westminster could be imprisoned there for a debt of 40 shillings. Jerry White writes that London's poorest debtors were housed in the Marshalsea. Wealthier debtors secured their removal from the Marshalsea by writ of habeas corpus, and {{arranged}} to be moved to the Fleet or King's Bench, both of which <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b> The prison also held {{a small number of}} men being tried at the Old Bailey for crimes at sea.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina and Washington {{remained}} in active {{duty in the}} years immediately after the war, possibly because they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> and less cramped than the four South Dakotas. The ships received alterations during this period; the Ship Characteristics Board(SCB) directed in June 1946 that four of the quadruple-mounted 40mm guns be removed, though only two were actually taken off each ship. The 20mm weapons were also reduced at some point so that both ships were decommissioned with sixteen twin mounts. North Carolina and Washington were decommissioned on 27 June 1947 and subsequently moved to the reserve fleet.|$|E
5|$|Hodgson {{made his}} NHL debut on February 1, 2011, in a 4–1 win against the Dallas Stars. Centring the fourth line and {{playing on the}} second powerplay unit, he {{registered}} two shots in over nine minutes of ice time. The following day, he scored his first career NHL goal against Ilya Bryzgalov in a 6–0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes. In his third game, he recorded his first career NHL assist on a goal by Christian Ehrhoff against the Chicago Blackhawks; Vancouver won 4–3. After appearing in his first five NHL games, Hodgson was returned to the Moose on February 11. Team management explained to the media his call-up was a means to introduce him to NHL play and that they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> having him continue developing in the AHL with first-line minutes and a bigger role with the Moose. However, with the team's fourth-line centre role unfilled (Alain Vigneault had been using natural winger Tanner Glass in that position), he was called back to Vancouver within ten days. Hodgson played three more games for the Canucks before the team acquired fourth-line centre Maxim Lapierre from the Anaheim Ducks at the trade deadline on February 28. Hodgson was subsequently sent back down to Manitoba. He completed his professional rookie season with 30 points in 52 AHL games – ranking fifth in Moose scoring – and two points in eight NHL games.|$|E

25|$|The Protestant Reformation in Europe {{that began}} in 1517 with Martin Luther (1483–1546) spread to Estonia in the 1520s. The Reformation in Estonia was {{inspired}} and organized by local and Swedish secular and religious authorities – especially {{after the end of}} the Livonian War in 1582. Lutheranism spread literacy among the young, and it transformed religious art. However, the peasants were traditionalists and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with Catholic traditions; they delayed the adoption of the new religion. After 1600, Swedish Lutheranism began to dominate the building, furnishing, and (modest) decoration of new churches. Church architecture was now designed to encourage congregational understanding of and involvement in the services. Pews and seats were installed for the common people to make listening to the sermon less of a burden, and altars often featured depictions of the Last Supper, but images and statues of the saints had disappeared. The Baltic German elite promoted Lutheranism, and language, education, religion and politics were greatly transformed. Church services were now given in the local vernacular, instead of Latin, and the first book was printed in Estonian.|$|E
25|$|The {{show was}} largely {{considered}} unsuccessful {{during its first}} season, but the characters were a hit. After disagreeing with the network executives over the series' storylines, Sachs and Judah ended their tenure as producers. The CW wanted the series to have a female perspective and focus more on teenage life and glamour; however, Judah and Sachs <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> writing for men, featuring family stories. The studio brought in Rebecca Rand Kirshner Sinclair, co-executive producer of the popular show Gilmore Girls, to revamp the failing 90210. Sinclair is largely credited for saving the show, which had steady ratings in its third season. For {{the remainder of the}} first season, Judah worked in post-production, including editing and music supervision, while Sachs ran the production on set. Rebecca Sinclair began retooling the series as head writer and formally took over the show at the start of season 2. In late February 2009, Sinclair signed a seven-figure deal with the producers to serve as executive producer/showrunner for the series' second and third seasons.|$|E

2500|$|Public Enemy {{began making}} the album at Chung King Studios in Manhattan but ran into {{conflicts}} with engineers prejudiced against hip hop acts. The group resumed recording at Greene St. Recording where they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b> Initially, the engineers at Greene Street were also apprehensive {{about the group}} but eventually grew to respect their work ethic and seriousness about the recording process. Recorded under the working title Countdown to Armageddon, the group ultimately decided on It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back instead, a line from their first album's song [...] "Raise the Roof". The material was recorded in 30 days for an estimated $25,000 in recording costs, due to an extensive amount of preproduction by the group at their Long Island studio. The album was completed in six weeks. [...] "It was aggressive, race-against-the-clock teamwork, taking chances in sound," [...] recalled Chuck D.|$|E
2500|$|All {{humans have}} a fundamental, evolutionarily-rooted {{need to feel}} {{socially}} connected to other people (i.e., to achieve [...] "belongingness" [...] or [...] "relatedness"). Simultaneously, people also hold a need for [...] "autonomy", or the desire to maintain a sense of independence and self-sufficiency. While these two psychological needs may initially appear to be contradictory (that is, it is not readily apparent how people may reconcile their need for social connection with their need for independence), psychological research shows that individuals who are more dependent on their intimate partners for support actually experience more autonomy, rather than less (a phenomenon that has been labelled the [...] "dependency paradox"). For example, Feeney (2007) showed that individuals whose romantic partners <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with having their partner depend on them {{were more likely to}} independently pursue and achieve their personal goals over a period of 6 months (without their partner's direct assistance). Such research is consistent with the idea that the most effective type of support for promoting personal growth (e.g., accepting challenges, trying new things, exploring) is support that involves simply communicating availability, and that individuals who feel confident in the availability of a secure base to fall back on in case their goal pursuits go wrong are less likely to actually over-rely on their secure base.|$|E
2500|$|Christensen {{received}} a Marshall 4x12 G1275 amplifier {{from his parents}} for his 18th birthday, which helped him write heavier music and would shortly thereafter result in the riff to the hit song [...] "Waterline". Their style would frequently be compared to Led Zeppelin and Pearl Jam, even though critics admitted that [...] "the trio wants—and inexplicably even manages—to create their own musical identity." [...] This style would become known as power rock, which the band would later also use to describe their genre and which they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with than the label [...] "grunge", explaining: [...] "We are not so wild about the descriptor grunge, as {{it has become a}} predicate for a variety of dimensions. We focus on the music, not the descriptions. What we play is genuine, vivid, and with the energy in high gear." [...] As a reviewer would put it: [...] " [...] 'Grunge light' perhaps - but well-composed, well-acted, engaging and above all different and personal. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy had the pedal to the metal, and it did something." [...] Christensen explains: [...] "It's like The Police, who came out of the punk-wave without being punk, and still did well. It's the same with us. We came out of the grunge-wave, without being grunge." ...|$|E

60|$|For a {{while they}} <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> {{than they had been}} for some time; now that his mother had no longer George to feed, her {{earnings}} and the three shillings he brought home every Saturday night enabled them to live in comparative ease, and on Sunday something like a feast was always prepared. But six months later Mrs. Andrews felt her eyesight failing, the lids became inflamed, and a dull aching pain settled in the eyeballs. Soon she could only work for a short time together, her earnings became smaller and smaller, and her employers presently told her that she kept the work so long in hand that they could no longer employ her. There was now only George's three shillings a week to rely upon, and this was swallowed up by the rent. In despair she had applied to the parish doctor about her eyes. For a fortnight he attended her, {{and at the end of}} that time had peremptorily given the order of which she had told her son.|$|E
60|$|We {{went with}} the mails from Sherbrooke to a village called Magog, at the outlet of the lake, and from thence by a steamer up the lake, to a solitary hotel called the Mountain House, which is built {{at the foot of}} the mountain, on the shore, and which is {{surrounded}} on every side by thick forest. There is no road within two miles of the house. The lake therefore is the only highway, and that is frozen up for four months in the year. When frozen, however, it is still a road, for it is passable for sledges. I have seldom been in a house that seemed so remote from the world, and so little within reach of doctors, parsons, or butchers. Bakers in this country are not required, as all persons make their own bread. But in spite of its position the hotel is well kept, and on the whole we <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> there than at any other inn in Lower Canada. The Mountain house is but five miles from the borders of Vermont, in which State the head of the lake lies. The steamer which brought us runs on to Newport, or rather from Newport to Magog and back again. And Newport is in Vermont.|$|E

She submitted to Cynthia's authority, and tried to make interest for an indefinite stay by sudden zeal and industry, and the last days of Jeff in the hotel <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than he openly recognized. He left the care of the building wholly to Whitwell, and shut himself up in the old farm parlor with the plans for a new hotel which he said he meant to put up some day, if he could ever get rid of the old one. He went once to Lovewell, where he renewed the insurance, and somewhat increased it; and he put a small mortgage on the property. He forestalled the slow progress of the knowledge of others' affairs, which, in the country, is as sure as it is slow, and told Whitwell what he had done. He said he wanted the mortgage money for his journey, and the insurance money, if he could have the luck to cash up by a good fire, to rebuild with.|$|E
6000|$|I at once got out my book, {{the eighth}} {{volume of the}} Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, printed in 1802, which {{contains}} some short notices of the Cape towns, {{and began to read}} up to where I was, for in the cars I could not read as fast as I travelled. To those who came from the side of Plymouth, it said: [...] "After riding through a body of woods, twelve miles in extent, interspersed with but few houses, the settlement of Sandwich appears, with a more agreeable effect, to the eye of the traveller." [...] Another writer speaks of this as a beautiful village. But I think that our villages will bear to be contrasted only with one another, not with Nature. I have no great respect for the writer's taste, who talks easily about beautiful villages, embellished, perchance, with a [...] "fulling-mill," [...] "a handsome academy," [...] or meeting-house, and [...] "a number of shops for the different mechanic arts"; where the green and white houses of the gentry, drawn up in rows, front on a street of which {{it would be difficult to}} tell whether it is most like a desert or a long stable-yard. Such spots can be beautiful only to the weary traveller, or the returning native,--or, perchance, the repentant misanthrope; not to him who, with unprejudiced senses, has just come out of the woods, and approaches one of them, by a bare road, through a succession of straggling homesteads where he cannot tell which is the alms-house. However, as for Sandwich, I cannot speak particularly. Ours was but half a Sandwich at most, and that must have fallen on the buttered side some time. I only saw that it was a closely built town for a small one, with glass-works to improve its sand, and narrow streets in which we turned round and round till we could not tell which way we were going, and the rain came in, first on this side, and then on that, and I saw that they in the houses <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than we in the coach. My book also said of this town, [...] "The inhabitants, in general, are substantial livers."--that is. I suppose, they do not live like philosophers: but, as the stage did not stop long enough for us to dine, we had no opportunity to test the truth of this statement. It may have referred, however, to the quantity [...] "of oil they would yield." [...] It further said, [...] "The inhabitants of Sandwich generally manifest a fond and steady adherence to the manners, employments, and modes of living which characterized their fathers"; which made me think that they were, after all, very much like all the rest of the world;--and it added that this was [...] "a resemblance, which, at this day, will constitute no impeachment of either their virtue or taste": which remark proves to me that the writer was one with the rest of them. No people ever lived by cursing their fathers, however great a curse their fathers might have been to them. But it must be confessed that ours was old authority, and probably they have changed all that now.|$|E
