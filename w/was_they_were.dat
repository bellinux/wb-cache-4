5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{took part}} in the {{gauntlet}} match at Glory By Honor 2, which was held to fill the tag team championship left vacant by Red suffering a serious knee injury. They defeated and eliminated the Special K team of Hydro and Angeldust as well as The Ring Crew Express, before being eliminated by the other Special K team in the match, Izzy and Dixie, due to outside interference from Angeldust. After Izzy and Dixie later won the tag team title, the Brothers were granted a shot at it, at Main Event Spectacles. The reason given in the storyline <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given the shot since they only lost in the gauntlet match because Special K cheated. In the opening segment of that event, they were aligned with Jim Cornette, because, in the storyline, Cornette wanted to create new champions. They attacked his former client, Samoa Joe, who Cornette abandoned since he already was a champion. They {{went on to win the}} belts later in the show. At The Conclusion, The Battle Lines Are Drawn, and The Last Stand, which was by stipulation Joe's last shot at the tag team title for as long as the Briscoe Brothers held it, they retained the belts over Joe and a different partner each time, A.J. Styles, Bryan Danielson, and Jerry Lynn respectively. Since Joe took pinfalls at The Conclusion (to Mark) and The Last Stand (to Jay), both brothers subsequently earned shots at his world title. Both fell; Mark at Final Battle 2003 and Jay at At Our Best in a memorable and bloody steel cage match.|$|E
25|$|From 1905 until 1989 {{there were}} two top {{divisions}} in Cornwall; Cornwall Senior League 1 East and Cornwall Senior League 1 West.

In 1990 the top six clubs {{in the east and}} west leagues formed County League One with St Just winning the league despite only finishing 6th in the western league the previous season. The irony of St Just winning the first title <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> initially against an all Cornwall league because of the increased expenditure of travel for teams in the far west.|$|E

Ford created a part for the recovering Ward Bond, who needed money. Although he was seen throughout the movie, he never walked until they put in a part where he was shot in the leg. For the rest of the picture, he was able to use a crutch on the final march. Ford repeatedly declared that he disliked the film and had never watched it, complaining that he had been forced to make it, although it was strongly championed by filmmaker Lindsay Anderson. Released several months {{after the end of the}} war, it was among the year's top 20 box-office draws, although Tag Gallagher notes that many critics have incorrectly claimed that it lost money.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the series}} aired its second episode, the writers spent time researching in offices. This process {{was used for}} Daniels' other series King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation. The pilot is a direct {{adaptation}} of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided to go this route because [...] "completely starting from scratch {{would be a very}} risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. He had briefly considered using the idea for [...] "The Dundies" [...] as the pilot episode. After the writers knew who the cast <b>was,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> allowed to write for the actors, which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode, [...] "Diversity Day". Following the mixed reaction towards the first season, the writers attempted to make the series more [...] "optimistic" [...] and to make Michael Scott more likable. They also established the supporting characters of the series more, giving them actual personalities. They also made the lights in the office brighter, which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British version.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1996, {{production}} {{began on}} a biographical comedy film adaptation of Private Parts for Paramount Pictures. Development had lasted {{over two years}} as Stern, who had final script approval, [...] "rejected every script there <b>was</b> ... <b>they</b> <b>were</b> over the top comedies that I think were dumb, boring and dull". After producer Ivan Reitman got involved with the project, Stern agreed to a script developed by Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko. Filming began in May 1996 with director Betty Thomas, and lasted four months with Stern, Quivers and Norris acting as their younger and current self. The crew travelled to the film set after each radio show and stayed there to shoot on weekends. Stern embarked on an extensive publicity tour to promote the film which included numerous television appearances and magazine interview {{in his attempt to}} appeal to people who were not listeners of his radio show. Private Parts premiered on February 27, 1997 at The Theater at Madison Square Garden; outside the theatre Stern and Rob Zombie performed [...] "The Great American Nightmare", a track they recorded for its soundtrack. The film's wide release followed on March 7, 1997. It topped the US box office in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million, and earned a domestic total of $41.2 million. In 1998, Stern received a Blockbuster Entertainment award for Favorite Male Newcomer and nominations for a Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Comedy) and a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star. The soundtrack, , sold 178,000 copies in its first week of release and entered the Billboard 200 chart in the United States at number one in March 1997, the highest selling debut release for a soundtrack to a feature film. Three months after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping one million copies. Stern also provides vocals on [...] "Tortured Man", a track he recorded with The Dust Brothers.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1971, The Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds made a {{trade that}} was one of the most {{impactful}} in the history of the sport, and helped create [...] "The Big Red Machine" [...] of the 1970s, with the Reds getting the better end of the deal. [...] The [...] Astros sent second baseman Joe Morgan, infielder Denis Menke, pitcher Jack Billingham, and outfielders César Gerónimo and prospect Ed Armbrister to Cincinnati for first baseman Lee May, second baseman Tommy Helms and infielder Jim Stewart. [...] The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world scratching their heads as to why Astros General Manager Spec Richardson would give up so much for so little. [...] May and Helms were good talents but both had obvious weaknesses. [...] The Reds on the other hand would shore up many problems. They had an off-year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in 1970. [...] They had plenty of power at the plate in Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Lee May. The problem <b>was,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all right-handed batters and two of the three were first basemen. [...] Three sluggers batting in a row in the middle of the Reds lineup caused issues: First, it left them vulnerable to right-handed pitching; next, there was the problem of double play balls killing a rally; finally, Perez, a first baseman, was placed at third in order to have both May and Perez in the line-up. [...] Perez at third base caused a fielding weakness. [...] Now with Menke, a proven veteran that could play third, Perez could move to first, thus strengthening the left side of the field. [...] They also got the 6ft 4in Billigham, who was just entering his prime as a pitcher and would go on to help lead the Big Red Machine to back-to-back World Series in 1975 and 1976. [...] The deal turned out to be more than just Morgan for May, but Morgan turning out to be a great second baseman for the Astros, to a second baseman that would turn out to be an all-time great, just made the deal that much better for the Reds.|$|E
