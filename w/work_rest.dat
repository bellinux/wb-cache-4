500|$|That debut album, One Step Beyond... was {{released}} by Stiff Records. The album included a re-recording of [...] "The Prince" [...] and its B-side [...] "Madness", and the band's second and third singles: [...] "One Step Beyond" [...] and [...] "My Girl". The title song was a cover of the B-side of the 1960s Prince Buster hit [...] "Al Capone". One Step Beyond... stayed in the British charts for 78 weeks, peaking at number 2. After the release of [...] "My Girl", the band {{felt that they had}} exhausted the material from One Step Beyond..., {{and did not want to}} release any more singles from the album. However, Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, disagreed. Eventually, a compromise was made, and the band decided to release an EP featuring one album track and three new tracks. The result was the <b>Work</b> <b>Rest</b> and Play EP, which was headlined by the song [...] "Night Boat to Cairo", from the One Step Beyond album. The EP reached number 6 in the UK singles chart.|$|E

40|$|It {{is evident}} that despite efforts {{directed}} at mitigating the risk of fatigue through the adoption of hours of <b>work</b> and <b>rest</b> regulations and development of codes and guidelines, fatigue still remains a concern in shipping. Lack of fatigue management {{has been identified as}} a contributory factor in a number of recent accidents. This is further substantiated through research reports with shortfalls highlighted in current fatigue management approaches. These approaches mainly focus on prescriptive hours of <b>work</b> and <b>rest</b> and include an individualistic approach to managing fatigue. The expectation is that seafarers are responsible to manage and tolerate fatigue as part of their working life at sea. This attitude is an accepted part of a seafarer’s role. Poor compliance is one manifest of this problem with shipboard demands making it hard for seafarers to follow hours of <b>work</b> and <b>rest</b> regulations, forcing them into this “poor compliance” trap. This makes current fatigue management approaches ineffective. This paper proposes a risk based approach and way forward for the implementation of a fatigue risk management framework for shipping, aiming to support the hours of <b>work</b> and <b>rest</b> requirements. This forms part of the work currently underway to review and update the International Maritime Organization, Guidelines on Fatigue...|$|R
