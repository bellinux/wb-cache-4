40|$|The {{density of}} {{deposits}} of dung of indigenous large herbivores {{was measured in}} transects starting at <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs</b> in the Kruger National Park. The aim was to test whether a relationship exists between intensity of (large indigenous) herbivore use and distance from <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs.</b> There was a significant positive relationship between intensity of herbivore use and'distance from the troughs. The variance was too high, however, to detect relationships at individual transects or to warrant further modelling of the relationship. It was {{concluded that there was}} indeed a slight concentration of large herbivore rangeland use around the troughs...|$|R

The task {{is designed}} to be an interaction between researcher and subject; The procedure and design are as follows. In this task there are four distinct locations with toy objects and toy animals at four different locations on a table; the subject and researcher have one location each and are facing each other; the other two locations are at either side of the table; three locations (subject, researcher and other) have a little enclosure where a toy animal "lives". One location only consists of a <b>drinking</b> <b>trough.</b> Researcher and subject choose an animal each; the procedure is as follows: each animal is made to move in turn, once to the <b>drinking</b> <b>trough</b> and once to the other animals to visit each other; each move to a different location (than the animal's own enclosure) is accompanied by a return journey to the animals own enclosure; the researcher moves the animals herself, but encourages the subject to move its own animal; each animal is moved between each location; when moving the animal the researcher asks the subject whether the animal is COMING or GOING...|$|R
50|$|As {{the film}} begins, Mademoiselle is shown opening {{floodgates}} to inundate the village, so there's never {{a moment in}} the film that the audience believes she's a normal upstanding citizen, as the villagers do. But the film provides little insight into her motivation; she has no cause for revenge, and acquires no material gain or increased standing in the community from her furtive crimes. Later, she sets fire to houses and poisons the <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs,</b> causing the death of farm animals.|$|R
50|$|The Azalea Dell and the Ravine: Rhododendrons and Azaleas grow well at Chatsworth as {{the soil}} suits them, and {{a section of}} the {{southern}} end of the garden is devoted to them.

After walking across the forest, the trail penetrates into a deep valley along the stream Arritzaga with fields all along. As the valley turns shallower, at the <b>drinking</b> <b>trough</b> of Pardeluts (1050 m), a valley going south-west must be taken in order to gain height up to the peak, on the right hand. 2h45 and back.|$|R
50|$|Troops' {{offensive}} and defensive attributes may be improved by constructing an armoury to enhance their weapons and armour. Upgrading the barracks, stable and workshop allow faster training of troops. There are also buildings known as the great barracks and the great stable, which allow simultaneous training of the same troop type but at three times the cost. Roman villages can build a horse <b>drinking</b> <b>trough</b> to speed up training of cavalry and reduce their upkeep. Teutons can build a brewery which improves the offensive attributes of troops from that village.|$|R
