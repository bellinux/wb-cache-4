5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, plans for Stord Airport, Sørstokken were launched. The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again {{brought up in}} 1982 as the {{industry}} on Bømlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport. A committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in May 1983 {{to look into the}} possibilities for a bridge. Led by Bømlo Mayor Arne M. Haldorsen, it issued Engineer Harald Møyner the task to author a report and recommendation. He made three proposals: a pontoon or suspension bridge between Foldrøyhomen and Litlaneset; a suspension bridge between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate just south of the new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near the airport, but stated that one closer further away <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{moved to}} the Phoenix Coyotes via free agency in 2005 and signed a one-year deal. On October 28, 2005, he won his 400th NHL game. On March 28, 2006, he posted his 424th career win, thereby moving into sixth place on the NHL's all-time list, passing Tony Esposito. Joseph had shown {{interest}} in re-joining the Toronto Maple Leafs, indicating that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> with a back-up role and a reduced salary. In September 2007 the Ottawa Senators quietly expressed interest in acquiring Joseph if they could unload Martin Gerber and his large contract. Joseph {{was a member of}} Team Canada in the 2007 Spengler Cup, leading them to the championship on December 31, 2007. While he was with the Coyotes, Curtis became the first goaltender to have 50 or more wins in a regular season for five different teams (St. Louis, Edmonton, Toronto, Detroit, and Phoenix).|$|E

[...] At {{one point in the}} second game against the Bees, Hershberger failed to field a bunt, and after the game alluded to his father's suicide to McKechnie in private, saying [...] "My father killed himself, and I'm gonna do it too." [...] However, after about an hour, Hershberger had calmed down considerably, and McKechnie {{believed}} he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Scottish singer Barbara Dickson, for the 1976 concept album, Evita, {{the basis of the}} musical of the same name. The musical was based on the life of Argentinian leader Eva Perón. Written by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the song is presented during a sequence where Eva throws out her husband's mistress on the streets. The latter sings the track, wondering about her future and coming to the conclusion that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b> Dickson was enlisted by the songwriters to record the track after hearing her previous work.|$|E

When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that if something happened to him she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine,</b> Tessa retorts, [...] "You only think so because it suits you." [...] The murderer is Chief Police Officer Andrew Ballin (Tom Butler) who is beheaded by MacLeod after Ballin failed to kill Tessa.|$|E

500|$|The film {{did receive}} some criticism. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent gave the film a mixed review, writing: [...] "On the one hand, Saving Mr. Banks (which was {{developed}} by BBC Films and has a British producer) is a probing, insightful character study with a very dark undertow. On the other, it is a cheery, upbeat marketing exercise in which the Disney organization is re-promoting {{one of its most}} popular film characters." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concluded that if the film [...] ""were 100 percent false and yet felt true, that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b> But this has the self-conscious whiff, if not of mendacity, then of public relations." [...] Lou Lumenick of The New York Post criticized the accuracy of the film's events, concluding that [...] "Saving Mr. Banks is ultimately much less about magic than making the sale, in more ways than one." [...] American history lecturer John Wills praised the film's attention to detail, such as the inclusion of Travers' original recordings, but doubted that the interpersonal relations between Travers and Disney were as amicable as portrayed in the film. Landon Palmer of Film School Rejects also described several moments where the film had a [...] "shrewd consumption of [...] own criticisms", only to later negate them and Disney-fy Travers as a character.|$|E
500|$|Maeda {{nominated}} Na-Ga {{to begin}} work on the character designs {{near the beginning of}} 2008. Na-Ga was worried that other computer graphics (CG) work for Key would get delayed, but he took the position because of his accumulated experience in CG. Maeda nominated Na-Ga because of the popular characters he designed in Little Busters!, and because of his frankness. Na-Ga designed Yuri based on her personality as a leader, though it was per Maeda's request that he added the black headband, taken from the character Yukiko Amagi from , who was Maeda's favorite heroine from that game. The length of Yuri's hair and the addition of a green ribbon were decided from production committee meetings. Angel's original concept began {{with the idea of a}} brave, fighting girl. Maeda cited that Angel's image had changed considerably over the development process and that originally she was similar to Shiki Ryōgi from Kara no Kyōkai. Eventually, Angel's concept changed to being a [...] "silent and mysterious girl". Before Na-Ga decided on Otonashi's design, Maeda told him that anything <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> and to just draw something, and eventually drew up a prototype for Otonashi and Hinata, among others. Some of the characters had vague initial conditions given by Maeda, such as asking Na-Ga to draw an [...] "all female band bass guitarist" [...] in the case of Girls Dead Monster member Sekine and particularly the cryptic [...] "character who speaks in puzzling English phrases" [...] for TK.|$|E

500|$|Scott {{noted that}} {{it was easier to}} reach correct puzzle solutions, with clues being given out [...] "at a very {{reasonable}} rate". He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a problem with it due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Treaty of Vienna, Bocskai {{proposed}} {{himself to}} Maria Christina of Habsburg, whose marriage with Sigismund Báthory had been annulled.

2500|$|In general, if {{a set of}} data {{structures}} {{needs to}} be included in linked lists, external storage is the best approach. [...] If a set of data structures need {{to be included in}} only one linked list, then internal storage is slightly better, unless a generic linked list package using external storage is available. [...] Likewise, if different sets of data that can be stored in the same data structure are to be included in a single linked list, then internal storage <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b>|$|E

Dandois also said of Kinkade, [...] "Thom <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine,</b> he would be drinking, {{and then all of}} a sudden, you couldn't tell where the boundary was, and then he became very incoherent, and he would start cussing and doing a lot of weird stuff."

2500|$|However, {{families}} are often anxious when told their {{child has a}} heart murmur. [...] Parents of children diagnosed with Still's murmur may experience significantly greater anxiety than the children themselves.

[...] Their concerns included: the need for medicine (49%), facing sports restrictions (41%), the need for heart surgery (29%), other offspring also having Still's murmur (20%), and early death (13%). Mothers worried that they did something during pregnancy that caused the murmur (19%). Even after being reassured by the child's physician, 17% of parents were still anxious.
