She meets up with her friends (Reyes, Jonah, Alex, and Sam), who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided {{that it can be}} repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara joins Alex in finding parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance. She finds him injured and stuck under some rubble. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rightwise's {{new market}} cross only survived in its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 {{of the participants in}} Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00am, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E

25|$|Solving such {{problems}} {{is actually an}} easy task and it is simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the data could become very tricky, but once it’s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are well worth the extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> to record the trajectory information in binary format.|$|E

40|$|Some visual-tactile (bimodal) {{cells have}} visual {{receptive}} fields (vRFs) that overlap and extend moderately beyond {{the skin of}} the hand. Neurophysiological evidence suggests, however, that a vRF will grow to encompass a hand-held tool following active tool use but not after passive holding. Why does active tool use, and not passive holding, lead to spatial adaptation near a tool? We asked whether spatial adaptation could be the result of motor or visual experience <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool,</b> and we distinguished between these alternatives by isolating motor from visual experience <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Participants learned to use a novel, weighted <b>tool.</b> <b>The</b> active training group received both motor and visual experience <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool,</b> <b>the</b> passive training group received visual experience <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool,</b> but no motor experience, and finally, a no-training control group received neither visual nor motor experience using <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> After training, we used a cueing paradigm to measure how quickly participants detected targets, varying whether <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> was placed near or far from the target display. Only the active training group detected targets more quickly when <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> was placed near, rather than far, from the target display.

25|$|Tool types {{found in}} Acheulean assemblages include pointed, cordate, ovate, ficron, and bout-coupé hand-axes (referring to {{the shapes of}} the final tool), cleavers, {{retouched}} flakes, scrapers, and segmental chopping tools. Materials used were determined by available local stone types; flint is most often associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> but its use is concentrated in Western Europe; in Africa sedimentary and igneous rock such as mudstone and basalt were most widely used, for example. Other source materials include chalcedony, quartzite, andesite, sandstone, chert, and shale. Even relatively soft rock such as limestone could be exploited. In all cases the toolmakers worked their handaxes close to the source of their raw materials, suggesting that the Acheulean was a set of skills passed between individual groups.|$|E
25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or immobilization. Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. The next step is to facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feeling about the experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) in problem solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E

Based on the Britannia, {{the design of the}} Argus maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft was optimised for endurance on long-range patrol, not speed, and used four Wright R-3350-32W Turbo-Compound engines that used less fuel at low altitude. Unlike its Britannia forebear, the Argus was a hybrid using the Britannia wings, tail surfaces and landing gear matched to a [...] "purpose-built", unpressurised fuselage. Another significant departure was being [...] "Americanized", substituting North American materials and standard parts for the British ones. The interior was well equipped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> to conduct anti-submarine warfare: navigation, communication and tactical electronic equipment along with weapon loads that included bombs, torpedoes, mines and depth charges. A total of 33 Argus aircraft were built in two series (Mk 1 and Mk 2), serving the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Forces from 1957 to 1982.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Apple did {{not officially}} {{acknowledge}} this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue {{have been subject}} to censorship. The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported that six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users that this was a hardware issue which could not be repaired, and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating that they were [...] "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem that the customer has on the replacement". The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when it was reported upon by iFixit.

500|$|In {{terms of}} labour process theory—the attempt to {{understand}} the relationship between management control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers over their own labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and skill structure. [...] In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. [...] The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. [...] On the shop floor, workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what [...] "skill" [...] they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had to find their own ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that Mikhail Gorbachev attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (Perestroika), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a decentralised system in 1991.|$|E
