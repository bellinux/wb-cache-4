5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
25|$|The Morning Post was {{designed}} by Henri Julliot to the same principles as the earlier Lebaudy République and Lebaudy Patrie but was larger and faster. The envelope was made of panels of <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> with two valves at the bottom to allow the hydrogen to be released, either automatically or by hand. An additional manual valve {{on the top of}} the envelope could be used to completely deflate the envelope. Two long quick-release panels were also built into the envelope for emergency deflation. The gas bag had three ballonets, one at the front, one in the centre and one at the rear: the front and rear ballonets could be used to fly the airship up or down. Two centrigual fans were used to inflate the ballonets. Small fixed vertical and horizontal stabilisers were mountes at the rear of the enveleope.|$|E
500|$|The British {{military}} built {{a series}} of specialised tanks, nicknamed Hobart's Funnies, to deal with conditions expected during the Normandy campaign. Developed {{under the supervision of}} Major-General Percy Hobart, these were specially modified M4 Sherman and Churchill tanks. Examples include the Sherman Crab tank (equipped with a mine flail), the Churchill Crocodile (a flame-throwing tank), and the Armoured Ramp Carrier, which other tanks could use as a bridge to scale sea-walls or to overcome other obstacles. In some areas, the beaches consisted of a soft clay that could not support the weight of tanks. The [...] "bobbin" [...] tank would overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface and leaving the material in place as a route for more conventional tanks. The Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were modified for many tasks, including laying bridges and firing large charges into pillboxes. The Duplex-Drive tank (DD tank), another design developed by Hobart's group, was a self-propelled amphibious tank kept afloat using a <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> screen inflated with compressed air. These tanks were easily swamped, and on D-Day many sank before reaching the shore, especially at Omaha.|$|E

5000|$|In 19th-century North America, the birch-on-frame {{construction}} technique {{evolved into}} the wood-and-canvas canoes made by fastening an external <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas</b> shell to planks and ribs by boat builders Old Town Canoe, E.M. White Canoe, Peterborough Canoe Company and at the Chestnut Canoe Company [...] in New Brunswick.|$|R
5000|$|Standard diving dress {{consists}} of a diving helmet made from copper and brass or bronze, an air hose from a surface supplied diving pump, a <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas</b> suit, diving knife, and weights to counteract buoyancy, generally on the chest, back and shoes. Later models were equipped with a diver's telephone for voice communications with the surface.|$|R
2500|$|In 1963, the Department of Defense began {{developing}} the [...] "Meal, Ready to Eat", a ration that would rely on modern food preparation and packaging technology {{to create a}} lighter replacement for the canned Meal, Combat, Individual ration. [...] In 1966, {{this led to the}} Long Range Patrol, or LRP ration, a dehydrated meal stored in a <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> pouch. However, just as with the Jungle ration, its expense compared to canned wet rations, as well as the costs of stocking and storing a specialized field ration, led to its limited usage and repeated attempts at discontinuance by Quartermaster Command officials.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{almost all}} {{traditional}} convertibles {{of the era}} that used frame-free side windows, the Rambler retained the fixed profile including the car's doors and rear-side window frames. This metal structure served as the side guides or rails for the retractable <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> top. This design allowed Nash to utilize its unibody construction on its new compact. It made the body very rigid for an open-top car, without additional bracing. The convertible top was cable-driven and electrically operated. The design is similar to other fixed-profile convertibles including the 1936 Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino", Nissan Figaro (1991), Citroën 2CV (1948–1990) and the 1957 Fiat 500 (1957) {{as well as its}} 2007 Fiat 500 successor.|$|E
60|$|The rain {{began to}} fall sharply and {{we were forced to}} camp on the {{opposite}} bank as swiftly as possible, in order {{to get out of the}} storm. We worked hard and long to put everything under cover and were muddy and tired at the end of it. At last the tent was up, the outfit covered with <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas,</b> the fire blazing and our bread baking. In pitching our camp we had plenty of assistance at the hands of several Indian boys from a near-by village, who hung about, eager to lend a hand, in the hope of getting a cup of coffee and a piece of bread in payment. The streaming rain seemed to have no more effect upon them than on a loon. The conditions were all strangely similar to those at the Muddy River.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, Straussler {{solved the}} problem by devising the {{flotation}} screen - a device which folded and was made of <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas.</b> The screen covered {{the top half of}} the tank effectively creating a canvas hull, greatly increasing the vehicle's freeboard, and providing buoyancy in the water. When collapsed, it would not interfere with the tank's mobility or combat effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{construction}} methods {{evolved from}} the manufacture of birchbark canoes. The transition occurred in the 19th century when canoe builders in the Eastern United States and Ontario, Canada, laid canvas instead of bark into a traditional building bed. Later, builders in Maine adapted English boat-building inverted-forms technology, whereby an external <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas</b> shell was fastened to a wooden hull formed with white cedar planks and ribs.|$|R
25|$|German-born British {{engineer}} Augustus Siebe {{developed the}} standard diving dress in the 1830s. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design - a helmet fitted {{to a full}} length watertight canvas diving suit. Later suits were made from <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas</b> invented by Charles Mackintosh. From the late 1800s and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century, most standard dress was made from a sheet of solid rubber laminated between layers of tan twill.|$|R
60|$|There {{was much}} to do to the hut. The absence of {{anything}} but stunted and impoverished timber and the limitation of time, had forbidden a log hut, and their home was really only a double framework, rammed tight between inner and outer frame {{with a mixture of}} earth and boughs and twigs of willow, pine and balsam. The floor was hammered earth carpeted with balsam twigs and a caribou skin. Outside and within wall and roof were faced with coarse canvas--that was Trafford's idea--and their bunks occupied two sides of the hut. Heating was done by the sheet-iron stove they had brought with them, and the smoke was carried out to the roof by a thin sheet-iron pipe which had come up outside a roll of canvas. They had made the roof with about the pitch of a Swiss châlet, and it was covered with nailed <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas,</b> held down by a large number of big lumps of stone. Much of the canvassing still remained to do when the men went down, and then the Traffords used every scrap of packing-paper and newspaper that had come up with them and was not needed for lining the bunks in covering any crack or join in the canvas wall.|$|E
60|$|We were a {{mile from}} shore; a little steam-tug put out from the land; she was an object of thrilling interest; she would climb to the summit of a billow, reel drunkenly there a moment, dim and gray in the driving storm of spindrift, then make a plunge like a diver and remain out of sight until one had given her up, then up she would dart again, on a steep slant toward the sky, {{shedding}} Niagaras of water from her forecastle--and this she kept up, {{all the way out}} to us. She brought twenty-five passengers in her stomach--men and women--mainly a traveling dramatic company. In sight on deck were the crew, in sou'westers, yellow <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> suits, and boots to the thigh. The deck was never quiet for a moment, and seldom nearer level than a ladder, and noble were the seas which leapt aboard and went flooding aft. We rove a long line to the yard-arm, hung a most primitive basketchair to it and swung it out into the spacious air of heaven, and there it swayed, pendulum-fashion, waiting for its chance--then down it shot, skillfully aimed, and was grabbed by the two men on the forecastle. A young fellow belonging to our crew was in the chair, to be a protection to the lady-comers. At once a couple of ladies appeared from below, took seats in his lap, we hoisted them into the sky, waited a moment till the roll of the ship brought them in overhead, then we lowered suddenly away, and seized the chair as it struck the deck. We took the twenty-five aboard, and delivered twenty-five into the tug--among them several aged ladies, and one blind one--and all without accident. It was a fine piece of work.|$|E
50|$|Recreational trampolines {{for home}} use are less sturdily {{constructed}} than competitive ones and their springs are weaker. They may be of various shapes, though most are circular, octagonal or rectangular. The fabric is usually a <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> or woven polypropylene material.|$|E
50|$|During the 1950s Fairey Marine {{decided to}} build a {{production}} folding boat, {{a cross between a}} canoe, a dinghy and a punt. Of plywood and <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas</b> construction, the boat was robust, with individual sections being bolted together and stiffened with removable bulkheads. Fore and aft shaped sections were added for better performance through the water. Additional sections were available so the boat could seat from one to four persons. There was even a rigid deck spray cover so it could be used for surf canoeing.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} suits {{were made}} of <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas</b> invented by Charles Mackintosh. From the late 1800s and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century, most suits consisted of a solid sheet of rubber between layers of tan twill. Their thick vulcanized rubber collar is clamped to the corselet making the joint waterproof. The inner collar (bib) was made of the same material as the suit and pulled up inside the corselet and around the diver's neck. The wrist cuffs are also made of vulcanized rubber.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} included [...] "wood {{covered with}} staff, and the fireproofed and <b>waterproofed</b> <b>canvas</b> roof {{is supported by}} three huge masts mounted on structural iron supports which are anchored to thirty-ton blocks of iron-weighted concrete. From these supports quarter-poles are extended, adding strength to the network of steel cables that holds the roof. At {{the west of the}} main building is a Pompeiian garden of novel design and with original features." [...] The interior walls were covered with white bunting and [...] "fountains, statuary, flowers, and shrubbery" [...] used for effect. Dwyer designed two massive statues that were carried out by sculptor Herman Matzen placed in the approach to the exhibition.|$|R

50|$|The ration {{differed}} from the standard wet-pack Meal, Combat, Individual (MCI) {{in that it was}} a freeze-dried, vacuum-packed individual ration meal weighing 11 oz packed in a <b>waterproof</b> grey-green <b>canvas</b> envelope lined with aluminum foil. Due to its discovered tendency to spoil in a wet or humid environment (e.g., all of South-east Asia), later ration packs came enclosed in an outer zip-lock clear-plastic bag to keep out the moisture. This drawback made it less than desirable as a standard ration.|$|R

50|$|The Sahariana engine {{located in}} the rear which gave it enough space {{in the middle of}} the hull to {{accommodate}} up to five fully equipped men and weapons, though the mission crew seldom exceeded three or four. The open compartment's only overhead protection was a <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas</b> sheet.

50|$|In Europe, {{a closer}} {{approximation}} to the Mongolian and Central Asian yurt is in production in several countries. These tents use local hardwood, and often are adapted for a wetter climate with steeper roof profiles and <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas.</b> In essence they are yurts, but some lack the felt cover and ornate features across the exterior that {{is present in}} traditional yurt. There are UK-made yurts that feature a metal frame in use {{in at least two}} glamping sites in Somerset and Dorset.|$|E
50|$|Discontinued {{after the}} Civil War, the U.S. Army again issued ponchos of <b>waterproof</b> {{rubberized}} <b>canvas</b> to its forces during the Spanish-American War of 1898. Two years later, both the Army and the Marines {{were forced to}} issue waterproof rubberized cloth ponchos with high neck collars during the Philippine-American War in 1900. With the entry of the United States into World War I, both doughboys and Marines in France wore the poncho; it was preferred over the raincoat {{for its ability to}} keep both the wearer and his pack dry, as well as serving as a roof for a makeshift shelter.|$|R
25|$|In the {{following}} investigation, {{it was discovered}} that the tent had not been fireproofed. Ringling Bros. had applied to the Army, which had an absolute priority on the material, for enough fireproofing liquid to treat their Big Top. The Army had refused to release it to them. The circus had instead <b>waterproofed</b> their <b>canvas</b> using an older method of paraffin dissolved in gasoline and painted onto the <b>canvas.</b> The <b>waterproofing</b> worked, but as had been repeatedly shown it was horribly flammable. Circus management was found to be negligent and several Ringling executives served sentences in jail. Ringling Brothers' management set aside all profits for the next ten years to pay the claims filed against the show by the City of Hartford and the survivors of the fire.|$|R
60|$|Basket-boat with Canvas Sides.--FitzRoy {{gives an}} account of a party of his sailors, whose boat had been stolen while they were encamped, putting out to sea in a large basket, woven with such boughs as were at hand, and covered with their canvas tent--the inside of which they had puddled with clay, to keep the water from oozing through too fast. They were {{eighteen}} hours afloat in this crazy craft. I mention this instance, to show how almost anything will make a boat. Canvas saturated with grease or oil is <b>waterproof,</b> and painted <b>canvas</b> is at first an excellent covering for a boat, but it soon becomes rotten.|$|R

50|$|In 1836, Sievier {{patented}} {{a process}} for rubberising fabrics and formed a ‘patent’ company (the London Caoutchouc Company - caoutchouc being the original name for India rubber). The company became large-scale manufacturers of elastic driving bands for machinery, rope for mines, waterproof cloths and garments, and <b>waterproof</b> <b>canvas,</b> as well the first rubber-insulated wire. His interests in manufacturing took over from the early 1840s onwards. Sievier's factory was situated close to his home, the Old Manor House, in Upper Holloway, at the south corner of Red Cap Lane (later Elthorne Road). Sievier also carried out experiments in electrical telegraphy there. The house was demolished in 1897.|$|E
5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the bedroll consisted of a thoroughly <b>waterproofed</b> white <b>canvas</b> tarpaulin made of Number Eight ducking weighing, most often, 18 oz. per square yard (i.e., 9 sq. ft.), and measuring either 6x14ft. or 7x18. (The reprinted 1897 Sears Roebuck Catalog lists [...] "stockmen’s bed sheets" [...] of [...] "heavy white duck," [...] with snap rings or eyelets, as 13-18 oz. for either size, but Fay Ward states that of the various weights of tarp (16-, 18-, 20-, and 22-ounce), the preferable one was [...] "the 18-ounce type… a good water excluder, is not too heavy to manage and will stand a lot of rough handling.") The tarpaulin cover was made {{with a series of}} snaps and rings down either side so it could be folded over and snapped shut. Inside were two to four almost-square heavy quilts called [...] "sougans," [...] folded double, made of heavy wool or cotton batting quilted between patches of pants, coats, and overcoats, or sometimes of patches alone, weighing about 4 lb. each, and generally used as a pad. The sougans in turn enwrapped a blanket or two (woolen ones weighed 4-6 lb. per; Navajo and Mexican Chimayo ones, which were both warm and waterproof, were highly desirable), a lightweight double blanket sheet 35" [...] wide (about 1 lb. for 3.75 yd.), and sometimes, sandwiched between them as a mattress, a thin, feather-filled comfort (probable weight about 5 lb.) known in cowboy vernacular as a [...] "henskin." [...] (The modern cowboy uses a 4"-thick twin-size foam mattress, but this is the only significant change that has taken place in over a century.) The tarpaulin cost roughly $7.70-$11.60, depending on its weight; the sougans, about 28-30c. for two 3x7' rolls of cotton batting (the patches being more or less free); the blankets $1.10-$9.96 each; the sheeting 34-53c., and the henskin, if applicable, 96c.-$2.25, so the entire roll could be assembled for anywhere between $9.42 and $34.60. At the very core was the [...] "war bag," [...] generally an old gunny sack that had at one time held grain, feed, or even sugar, though some were of canvas, cotton, or oilskin. Earlier rolls (and those of riders traveling light, such as outlaws on the run) were wrapped in a canvas groundcloth, an oilskin cover, cowhide blanket, rubber blanket, or India-rubber [...] "sleeping spread," [...] and consisted of a blanket or two and perhaps a quilt, or even a couple of buffalo robes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{choice of}} paint {{color on the}} walls in Victorian homes {{was said to be}} based on the use of the room. Hallways that were in the entry hall and the stair halls were painted a somber gray so as not to compete with the {{surrounding}} rooms. Most people marbleized the walls or the woodwork. Also on walls it was common to score into wet plaster to make it resemble blocks of stone. Finishes that were either marbleized or grained were frequently found on doors and woodwork. [...] "Graining" [...] was meant to imitate woods of higher quality that were more difficult to work. There were specific rules for interior color choice and placement. The theory of “harmony by analogy” was to use the colors that lay next to each other on the color wheel. And the second was the “harmony by contrast” that was to use the colors that were opposite of one another on the color wheel. There was a favored tripartite wall that included a dado or wainscoting at the bottom, a field in the middle and a frieze or cornice at the top. This was popular into the 20th century. Frederick Walton who created linoleum in 1863 created the process for embossing semi-liquid linseed oil, backed with <b>waterproofed</b> paper or <b>canvas.</b> It was called Lincrusta and was applied much like wallpaper. This process made it easy to then go over the oil and make it resemble wood, leather or different types of leather. On the ceilings that were 8-14 feet the color was tinted three shades lighter than the color that was on the walls and usually had a high quality of ornamentation because decorated ceilings were favored.|$|R
