500|$|While one set {{of critics}} and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the {{argument}} raised in Carr's essay, another set took {{a closer look at}} the conclusions that could be drawn from the study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning skills that are apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it will take time before it's clear <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, or learn to stop worrying and love the Net".|$|E

40|$|Reception {{histories}} are retrospectives; {{they look}} back at publications and ask who has cited them, how often, when, where and why. This paper takes an influential 1996 paper on genre analysis and examines how it has played out intertextually over the 15 years or so since its publication. The main sources used have been Google Scholar and the Web of Science. The quantitative results show {{that it has been}} primarily, but not exclusively, cited in ESP publications. The more qualitative aspect of this investigation reveals that its value for most later commentators lies in its review-article potential to act as an interpretive frame for subsequent work. The paper ends with a discussion of <b>whether</b> today <b>we</b> <b>should</b> accept just “three traditions ” for genre analysis and its pedagogical applications or look further afield...|$|R

The purpose and principal objective of education from the critical educational science point of view is striving towards maturity and self-determination leading to emancipation and solidarity development. Contemporary society is marked by large educational crisis determined by postulates of so called “neoliberal pedagogy” where, very frequently, education becomes its opposite.
