40|$|Metal loss is an {{unavoidable}} {{consequence of the}} large scale melting of aluminium and its alloys. The objective of such processing must be to minimise losses, both from an economic viewpoint and to ensure optimum quality of cast and <b>wrought</b> products. <b>Aluminium</b> losses during melting and casting are primarily due {{to the formation of}} dross, a mixture of oxide and melt. Many of the commercially important aluminium alloys contain appreciable levels of magnesium (up to 5 %) which can result in enhanced oxidation rates that give rise to particular problems in recycling. Results are presented from a study aimed at reducing melt loss through a knowledge of the mechanism by which dross is formed. Work has centred on an understanding of the early stages in oxide scale growth, a study of growth kinetics and subsequent breakdown of these initial scales to form dross. In humid atmospheres, the amorphous oxide covering both aluminium and aluminium-magnesium at 750 °C provides a highly effective barrier protecting the molten metal. In the absence of water vapour, oxide crystal development in aluminium-magnesium alloys is dominated by magnesium, and is extremely rapid in comparison with pure aluminium. Despite the different oxides formed, the manner of crystal formation at the 'amorphous' oxide-melt interface at 750 °C on both aluminium and aluminium-magnesium is comparable. Nucleation and growth of crystals in the 'amorphous' film generates high stresses which result in failure of the surface oxide. Scanning electron microscopy has shown that the localised failure of this protective oxide film results in exudations forming on the melt surface, the size and number of which increase with exposure time. These exudations would appear to be the onset of dross formation. Parallel studies of the wetting characteristics of aluminium to alumina have shown that the reported non-wetting is due to the presence of the thin alumina film on the melt surface. Once broken, wetting of the alumina takes place and accounts for the exudation of molten metal through the surface oxide and hence dross formation...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of heritage assets relies on decision-making which is underpinned by empirical evidence of impact of treatments on long term survival prospects of materials. Historic wrought iron presents {{a particular problem}} for conservation. It occupies a niche position between heritage and engineering, is frequently exposed to outdoor atmospheric corrosion and, {{in the case of}} bridges, gates and similar structures, may be required to perform a distinct function. Sector guidance to direct practices is based on anecdotal evidence and established methods. British Standards relate to modern steels hence application to historic ferrous metals is complicated by differences in metallurgy and lack of concession to conservation ethics. This study generates empirical evidence of the effects of five surface preparation methods and three protective coating systems on the corrosion rate of historic wrought iron samples. Immersion in sodium hydroxide solution and blasting with crushed walnut shells are found to reduce corrosion rates of uncoated <b>wrought</b> iron. <b>Aluminium</b> oxide and glass beads blasting increase corrosion rate but offer removal of contaminants and a keyed surface for coating adhesion. Flame cleaning increases corrosion rate by almost four times the uncleaned wrought iron corrosion rate. A two-pack epoxy resin coating system with polyurethane topcoat applied over substrate surfaces blasted to Sa 2. 5 (near white metal) and a surface tolerant single-pack alkyd coating applied over coherent oxide layers successfully prevented corrosion for almost two years in high static relative humidity environments. An alkyd system applied over Sa 2. 5 blasted surface does not significantly reduce corrosion rate of the uncoated substrate. A cost benefit approach to interpreting the empirical results in relation to practicalities of applying the treatments is advocated. The methods developed for standardising historic sample material and measuring oxygen consumption of coated samples as proxy corrosion rate offer scope for further work in this area. A standardised approach to testing permits correlation of test data between workers in this area to generate a database of empirical data to inform decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Under {{dynamic loading}} the {{stabilising}} effect of increased strain rate {{sensitivity of the}} material restrains neck formation in tension tests and leads {{to an increase in}} ductility. On the other hand the adiabatic character of the deformation process reduces the flow stress and promotes instability, localisation and adiabatic shear band initiation. Furthermore, the notch sensitivity of the material increases with increasing strain rate. Dynamic and quasi-static tension and compression tests were carried out on the age hardenable <b>aluminium</b> <b>wrought</b> alloy AA 7075. There, dispers distributed precipitations are often the starting point for ductile hcture caused by impact due to the nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids and micro-cracks in case of tension. Neck formation under tensile loading and instabilities like shear bands in case of compression are discussed {{on the basis of the}} theory of imperfections under consideration of the increased strain rate sensitivity of the material and the adiabatic character of the deformation process at high strain rates.

40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>wrought</b> alloys {{as well as}} powder metallurgical {{aluminium alloys}} are limited regarding massive formability. The formability at room temperature can be significantly affected by superimposing hydrostatic pressure. Depending on the process control, cold forming enables locally induced strain hardening effects, whereby increased hardness or hardness gradients can be regulated. Simultaneously, the necessity of mechanical post processing is reduced by a metal forming fabrication of joint and connection elements at room temperature. By splitting the component in strengthened and not strengthened regions, specially adapted property profiles can be adjusted to the application. Thus, specially load adapted components with locally optimised property profiles e. g. ductile or high strength, brittle areas can be manufactured. A defined buckling or folding of a component {{in case of a}} crash can thereby be achieved. In this project innovative tool principles for superimposed cold solid forming will be developed. They will be used to manufacture high strength and complex aluminium structure components with specific adjustment of local strain hardening.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze creep behavior of forged AA 2014 alloy and to develop a constitutive model to describe inelastic response undermulti-axial stress state. Experimental data show that creep rates depend essentially on the loading direction within the power law creep regime,while in the power law breakdown range creep anisotropy is not essential and can be neglected. Microstructural observation suggest that the anisotropy of creep is primarily caused by elongated grains and grain boundaries as are suit of material processing. Assuming the inhomogeneous deformation indifferent microstructural zones including interiors of elongated grains and grain boundary regions,a phase mixture model of inelastic deformation is developed. The model include constitutive equations for individual phases and an interaction rule to capture the direction dependent creep. Additional state variables including the normalized dislocation density and the normalized particle size as well as corresponding evolution equations are introduced to describe hardening/recovery and over aging processes.
