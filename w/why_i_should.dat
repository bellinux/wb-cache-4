Crawford's father wrote to the Surrey committee {{in support of his}} son. By the beginning of August 1909, two weeks after the match against the Australians, the Surrey committee severed their connection with Crawford; Leveson Gower felt that he had shown the [...] "deepest ingratitude". Wisden reported: [...] "The committee were much incensed and passed a resolution that Crawford be not again asked to play for the county." [...] Informed of his expulsion by letter, Crawford replied to the committee a final time: [...] "I fail to see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> practically be branded as a criminal because, as acting captain, I declined the responsibility of skippering a team which did not include three essential players, an independence which I trust will remain in spite of the awful example made of me to every amateur in the United Kingdom." ...|$|E
500|$|Sobers was met in Bridgetown by an {{enormous}} and hostile press storm. [...] "To {{say there was}} an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place," [...] the Jamaican politician Michael Manley later wrote in his History of West Indies Cricket. The Antigua Labour Party's Workers' Voice newspaper damned Sobers as [...] "a white black man" [...] and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had [...] "abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular". Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he [...] "may not be welcomed anywhere by {{people who believe that}} justice is bigger than even sport". Frank Walcott of the Barbados Workers' Union, who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others. Sobers told reporters at Seawell Airport that he had [...] "never been bothered about criticism, and I do not see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> start now". Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, Leader of the Opposition in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' [...] "calm dignity in response to the primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians".|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E

500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E

However, he continued to send her an allowance until her death. In 1870, she suggested visiting Fisher in England, but he dissuaded her as strongly as he could. Fisher wrote to his wife: [...] "I hate the very thought of it and really, I don't want to see her. I don't see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> as I haven't the slightest recollection of her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sager {{was born}} June 29, 1951 in Batavia, Illinois.

Sager's winning essay {{was published in the}} Congressional Record and drew editorial accolades from conservative newspapers around the country for his declaration that he was an [...] "untypical teen" [...] of the silent majority that was not part of any protest movement and [...] "happy we were born in America and not in Havana, Moscow, or Peiping".|$|E

2500|$|Ivașcu died in Bucharest on June 21, 1988, {{one and a}} {{half years}} before the anti-communist Revolution. In an {{obituary}} piece written by Coroiu, Ivașcu is referred to as [...] "the greatest Romanian journalist of the postwar era." [...] By July 2006, on Ivașcu's 95th anniversary, Coroiu noted that [...] "there is yet no reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> revise that claim". Already in July 1988, Ivașcu's colleagues at România Literară were taking steps toward political independence. A Securitate note on the period reported that Manolescu and Iorgulescu, together with Ion Bogdan Lefter and other writers, were seeking to commit the magazine to pure aestheticism and [...] "reduce the political content", [...] "as the late director would have wanted it".|$|E
2500|$|Frederick Taylor told Der Spiegel, [...] "I {{personally}} {{find the}} attack on Dresden horrific. It was overdone, it was excessive and is to be regretted enormously," [...] but, [...] "A war crime is a very specific thing which international lawyers argue about {{all the time and}} I would not be prepared to commit myself nor do I see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should.</b> I'm a historian." [...] Similarly, British philosopher A. C. Grayling has described British area bombardment as an [...] "immoral act" [...] and [...] "moral crime" [...] because [...] "destroying everything ... contravenes every moral and humanitarian principle debated in connection with the just conduct of war," [...] but, [...] "It is not strictly correct to describe area bombing as a 'war crime'.".|$|E
2500|$|After his wife's death, {{he began}} to {{disagree}} with the church's methods, writing in his journal in June 1832, [...] "I have sometimes thought that, {{in order to be}} a good minister, it was necessary to leave the ministry. The profession is antiquated. In an altered age, we worship in the dead forms of our forefathers". His disagreements with church officials over the administration of the Communion service and misgivings about public prayer eventually led to his resignation in 1832. As he wrote, [...] "This mode of commemorating Christ is not suitable to me. That is reason enough <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> abandon it". As one Emerson scholar has pointed out, [...] "Doffing the decent black of the pastor, he was free to choose the gown of the lecturer and teacher, of the thinker not confined within the limits of an institution or a tradition".|$|E

2500|$|In the 2013 Film Inside Llewyn Davis by the Coen brothers, F. Murray Abraham {{portrays a}} fictional {{character}} named Bud Grossman, who owns The Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago, {{the same name}} as Albert Grossman's Chicago club. In the film, fictional folk singer Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) auditions for Bud Grossman, who replies: [...] "I don't {{see a lot of}} money here." [...] This comment refers to the experience of Dave Van Ronk, who recounted a similar audition for Grossman, who then asked: [...] "Do you know who works here? Big Bill Broonzy works here. Josh White works here... Now tell me <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hire you?" [...] After this comment, Grossman offers Davis a part in a band he is about to put together, consisting of two guys and a girl, which one journalist notes is [...] "a reference to Peter, Paul, and Mary, the trio that Albert Grossman put together in 1961—ultimately choosing Noel Paul Stookey as the third member of the group, rather than Van Ronk, whom he also considered." [...] Davis turns down the offer.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 August Sir John {{received}} {{messages from}} Joffre and President Poincare (relayed via Bertie, the British Ambassador) asking {{him not to}} withdraw. Joffre {{pointed out that the}} Germans were already shifting forces to the East. Kitchener demanded further details, and after showing French's previous message to the Cabinet telegraphed again warning that it was the manner and length of the retreat which concerned the Cabinet. Sir John then replied that the [...] "shattered condition" [...] of II Corps had reduced his offensive capability and that the BEF could not withstand an attack by so much as a single German corps. He wrote: [...] "I do not see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> again be called upon to run the risk of absolute disaster in order a second time to save (the French)." [...] He also argued that the best solution would be for the French to counterattack and so [...] "close the gap by uniting their inward flanks", although he agreed to halt at Nanteuil, which he expected the BEF to reach the following day, if the French halted their own retreat. Kitchener, authorised by a midnight meeting of whichever Cabinet Ministers could be found, left for France for a meeting on 1 September.|$|E
2500|$|Faber {{published}} {{the book in}} 1936. Though reviews treated it as a major work of art, the book did not sell well. Barnes received no advance from Faber and the first royalty statement was for only £43; the U.S. edition published by Harcourt, Brace the following year fared no better. Barnes had published little journalism in the 1930s and was largely dependent on Peggy Guggenheim's financial support. She was constantly ill and drank more and more heavily—according to Guggenheim, she accounted {{for a bottle of}} whiskey a day. In February 1939 she checked into a hotel in London and attempted suicide. Guggenheim funded hospital visits and doctors, but finally lost patience and sent her back to New York. There she shared a single room with her mother, who coughed all night and who kept reading her passages from Mary Baker Eddy, having converted to Christian Science. In March 1940 her family sent her to a sanatorium in upstate New York to dry out. Furious, Barnes began to plan a biography of her family, writing to Emily Coleman that [...] "there is no reason any longer <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> feel for them in any way but hate." [...] This idea would eventually come to fruition in her play The Antiphon. After she returned to New York City, she quarreled bitterly with her mother and was thrown out on the street.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{press conference}} ostensibly convened to promote [...] "Break Away" [...] to the European media shortly thereafter, Wilson intimated that [...] "We owe {{everyone}} money. And if we don't pick ourselves off our backsides and have a hit record soon, {{we will be in}} worse trouble... I've always said, 'Be honest with your fans.' I don't see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> lie and say that everything is rosy when it's not." [...] These incendiary remarks ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with Deutsche Grammophon. Although Murry Wilson's sale of the Sea of Tunes publishing company (including the majority of Wilson's oeuvre) to A Records' publishing division for $700,000 at the band's commercial nadir in 1969 renewed the longstanding animus between father and son, the younger Wilson stood in for Mike Love during a 1970 Northwest tour when Love was convalescing from illness. He also resumed writing and recording with the Beach Boys at a brisk pace; seven of the twelve new songs on the 1970 album Sunflower were either written or co-written by Wilson. Nevertheless, the album (retrospectively appraised as [...] "perhaps the strongest album they released post-Pet Sounds" [...] by Pitchfork) was a commercial failure in the US, peaking at number 151 during a four-week Billboard chart stay in October 1970. Following the termination of the Capitol contract in 1969, the band's new contract with then-au courant Reprise Records (brokered by Van Dyke Parks, employed as a multimedia executive at the company at the time) stipulated Brian Wilson's proactive involvement with the band in all albums, a factor that would become hugely problematic for the band in the years to come.|$|E
