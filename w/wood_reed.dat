5|$|The {{earliest}} known shrines {{appeared in}} Egypt {{in the late}} Predynastic Period, in the late fourth millenniumBC, at sites such as Sais and Buto in Lower Egypt and Nekhen and Coptos in Upper Egypt. Most of these shrines were made of perishable materials such as <b>wood,</b> <b>reed</b> matting, and mudbrick. Despite the impermanence of these early buildings, later Egyptian art continually reused and adapted elements from them, evoking the ancient shrines to suggest the eternal nature of the gods and their dwelling places.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the winter}} the Carthaginians {{continued}} {{to build up}} their forces. They prepared a fleet in order to cut the supply routes and blockade fully the Roman army and were awaiting for mercenaries from Iberia and Liguria. The actual hostilities ceased for a time due {{to the efforts of}} Syphax to arbitrate for a reconciliation. Hasdrubal accepted the proposed terms, which stipulated that both Rome and Carthage should recall their armies respectively from Africa and Italy, but did not stop the aforementioned military preparations. Peace under such conditions was definitely not the purpose, with which Scipio negotiated with Syphax. At first he used the negotiations as a cover for trying to win over the Numidian to Rome. As these attempts proved to be of no avail, the Roman leader nevertheless continued to send envoys to the Numidian camp. Scipio aimed, firstly, to mislead the enemy that he was insecure and therefore anxious to conclude peace and, secondly, to reconnoitre the position and organization of the enemy. His envoys, who were carefully selected for the latter purpose, informed him that the both camps consisted primarily of huts built from <b>wood,</b> <b>reed</b> and other flammable material.|$|E

They can measure anywhere from fifty cm to over three meters in height costing between 400 and 20,000 pesos to make.

The toritos are giving names such as El Chico, Sagitario Toro Maya and Monster. In the 2013 event, over 250 of these toritos were registered to participate. The toritos are paraded on March 8, in honor of John of God, the patron saint of fireworks makers. The toritos proceeds over the various streets of Tultepec, setting off their fireworks for five to six hours until they arrive to the main plaza of the town.|$|E

50|$|True hickories sprout prolifically from stumps after {{cutting and}} fire. As the stumps {{increase}} in size, {{the number of}} stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting. Coppice management is a possibility with true hickories. True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation <b>wood.</b> <b>Reed</b> indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (Carya aquatica).|$|E

Anglia did not claim for loss of profits, because that was too uncertain. Instead they claimed wasted expenditure. Reed argued, based on Tindal CJ in Hodges v Earl of Litchfield (1835) 1 Bing NC 492, 498 that damages could not be claimed when incurred before a contract, that was wasted, thrown away.|$|E
5000|$|James {{advocated}} a “New Social Order in the South," [...] to replace slavery with free institutions. The freedpeople had {{a variety of}} skills: many were artisans, who made baskets, shoes, barrels, shingles, and boats, which could be traded or sold. James intended to market both the natural resources and the freedmen's crops, such as cotton, corn, turpentine, resin, tar, timber, fish, oysters, <b>wood,</b> <b>reeds,</b> and grapes, to make the colony self-sufficient. While thinking freedmen should have the rights of citizens, he also held that “there was a natural stratification of society” and African Americans were near the bottom.|$|R

50|$|Many herbs with {{primarily}} northern distributions occur here, including oak fern, pod grass (collected in 1909), Canada mayflower, mountain bindweed, marsh marigold, goldthread, swamp saxifrage, {{white wood}} sorrel, northern white violet, Jacob's ladder and buckbean. Jacob's ladder {{is at its}} southernmost location. Grasses and sedges found here include blue joint, drooping <b>wood</b> <b>reed</b> grass, millet grass, rattlesnake mannagrass, interior sedge, and Fraser's sedge. Wild lilies in the Glades include yellow clintonia and white hellebore. Several species of orchids also grow here, such as the rose pogonia, lesser rattlesnake plantain, northern coralroot, and grass-pink orchid that are in full bloom in July. Northern (or early) coralroot is probably at its southernmost location in the eastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|All of {{the scenes}} in which Tracy cut herself were shot in a single day; Wood {{recalled}} running to her brother for emotional support between some takes. Wood later described the shooting of the two make out scenes with Javi and Luke as [...] "awkward" [...] because her family was watching behind the scenes. Wood's mom requested that in the scenes with Tracy's bra exposed, that {{the front of her}} not be seen on camera. The whole scene with Luke was rendered in a single, long and uncut take with <b>Wood,</b> <b>Reed</b> and Pardue, but was tightly choreographed with several crew members, social workers and parents also in the small room, carefully staying either hidden or behind the camera as it panned more than 200°, showing all four walls.|$|E
5000|$|Most saxophones, both {{past and}} present, {{are made from}} brass. Despite this, they are {{categorized}} as woodwind instruments rather than brass, as the sound waves are produced by an oscillating <b>wood</b> <b>reed,</b> not the player's lips against a mouthpiece as in a brass instrument, and because different pitches are produced by breath wind passing opening and closing keys. The screw pins that connect the rods to the posts, {{as well as the}} needle and leaf springs that cause the keys to return to their rest position after being released, are generally made of blued or stainless steel. Since 1920, most saxophones have [...] "key touches" [...] (smooth replaceable pieces placed where the fingers touch the instrument) made from either plastic or mother of pearl. Recently, some saxophones are offered with abalone or stone keytouches.|$|E

50|$|Replacement of the Arthur M. Churchill Memorial Bridge {{arose from}} the Campus Facilities Master Plan, adopted by the City of Portland in 1990. The initial {{feasibility}} study offered six replacement options constructed of <b>wood.</b> <b>Reed</b> College's Canyon Committee selected the option which routed access to {{the north end of}} the bridge at the lawn south of Chittick dormitory, following the existing alignment between Chittick, Coleman and Woodbridge dormitories. During the schematic design phase, Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership (now known as ZGF Architects LLP) considered four conceptual structures: concrete, steel beam, steel truss and wood. ZGF recommended concrete to the Canyon Committee as offering the longest lifespan, lowest maintenance costs and the least environmental damage to the canyon during construction. The alignment of the north walkway was amended to continue the existing route between Ackerman, Chittick, Coleman and Sisson dormitories, maintaining direct access to the bridge from the north parking lot. The schematic design process for a concrete bridge was further developed to include accessibility for people with disabilities, walkway alignment and environmental restoration. This design was presented to the Reed campus community in November 1990. By January 1991, a construction budget had been developed with a general contractor.|$|E
