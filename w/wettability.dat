5|$|The <b>wettability</b> of {{a surface}} is {{determined}} by the outermost chemical groups of the solid.|$|E
5|$|Differences in <b>wettability</b> between {{surfaces}} {{that are}} similar in structure are {{due to differences in}} the packing of the atoms. For instance, if a surface has branched chains, it will have poorer packing than a surface with straight chains.|$|E
5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is the angle at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of <b>wettability.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{numerical}} simulations {{give more}} detailed evidence {{to explain the}} experiment results. The droplet impingement cooling process is subdivided into a dynamic phase and a quasi-static phase. Surfaces with better <b>wettabilities</b> have faster spreading and larger maximum spreading radii which result in stronger liquid convection during the dynamic phase. Droplets on surfaces with worse <b>wettabilities</b> recoil more after their maximum spreading radii and even rebound from the surface. Surfaces with better <b>wettabilities</b> have large liquid wetting areas during the quasi-static phase, so the liquid evaporation is increased because of larger liquid-vapor interfaces and thinner liquid films.|$|R
30|$|The {{numerical}} results agree {{well with}} spray-cooling experiments which show that dropwise evaporative cooling on surfaces with better <b>wettabilities</b> {{is much better}} because of the better liquid spreading and convection, better liquid-solid contact, and stronger liquid evaporation. The droplet impingement cooling simulations reveal the mechanisms for spray cooling of surfaces with various <b>wettabilities</b> based on simulations of a single droplet.|$|R
30|$|Marangoni {{convection}} in the droplets on surfaces {{with different}} <b>wettabilities</b> was also {{studied in the}} numerical simulations. A modified Marangoni number was presented to explain the simulation results showing that Marangoni convection is stronger inside droplets on a surface with smaller contact angles.|$|R
5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (<b>wettability)</b> is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two decades}} (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E
25|$|Antimony {{is added}} to {{increase}} strength without affecting <b>wettability.</b> Prevents tin pest. Should be avoided on zinc, cadmium, or galvanized metals as the resulting joint is brittle.|$|E
25|$|One {{trend of}} {{research}} {{is the study of}} the relationship between <b>wettability</b> and anti-fouling effectiveness. Another trend is the study of living organisms as the inspiration for new functional materials. An example of biomimetic antifouling research was conducted at the University of Florida into how marine animals such as dolphins and sharks are able to effectively deter biofouling on their skin. Researchers examined the nanoscale structure of sharks and designed an anti-fouling surface known commercially as Sharklet. Studies show that the nanoscale topologies function not only due to the reduction of sites for macrofoulers to attach, but also due to the same thermodynamic barrier that any surface with low <b>wettability</b> presents.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{parallel}} lattice Boltzmann multiphase model {{was developed to}} investigate the effects of surface structures on <b>wettabilities</b> and flow dynamics in a microchannel. The theory of wetting transition was firstly discussed. Then three types including triangular, rectangle and hierarchical shaped microstructures were constructed on the surface {{to examine the effects}} on <b>wettabilities</b> and drag reduction. It was found that flow behaviour is strongly affected by the surface morphology of the channel. The results indicated that hierarchical structures on the surface could improve the hydrophobicity significantly. For rectangular structures, they can improve the hydrophobicity with the increase of height and distance ratio h/d of the structures, and the improvement will reach its optimal hydrophobicity when the value h/d is over a certain value of 0. 6. Moreover, to accelerate computational speed, the Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) was employed for the parallelization of the model. A maximum speedup of 2. 95 times was obtained for 4 threads on a multi-core CPU platform...|$|R

25|$|Materials {{research}} into superior antifouling surfaces for fluidized bed reactors suggest that low <b>wettability</b> plastics such as Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC"), high-density polyethylene and polymethylmethacrylate ("plexiglas") demonstrate a high correlation between their resistance to bacterial adhesion and their hydrophobicity.|$|E
25|$|A SWCNTs-based {{supercapacitor}} with aqueous electrolyte was systematically {{studied at}} University of Delaware in Prof. Bingqing Wei's group. Li et al., {{for the first}} time, discovered that the ion-size effect and the electrode-electrolyte <b>wettability</b> are the dominant factors affecting the electrochemical behavior of flexible SWCNTs-supercapacitors in different 1 molar aqueous electrolytes with different anions and cations. The experimental results also showed for flexible supercapacitor, it is suggested to put enough pressure between the two electrodes to improve the aqueous electrolyte CNT supercapacitor.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} surface {{selection and}} adhesion of motile zoospores of a green, macrofouling alga (Entero-morpha) to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) having {{a range of}} <b>wettabilities.</b> The SAMs were formed from alkyl thiols terminated with methyl (CH 3) or hydroxyl (OH) groups or mixtures of CH 3 - and OH-terminated alkyl thiols and were characterized by measuring the advancing contact angles and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. There was {{a positive correlation between}} the number of spores that attached to the SAMs and increasing contact angle (hydrophobicity). Moreover, the sizes of the spore groups (adjacent spores touching) were larger on the hydrophobic SAMs. Video microscopy of a patterned arrangement of SAMs showed that more zoospores were engaged in swimming and “searching ” above the hydrophobic sectors than above the hydrophilic sectors, suggesting that the cells were able to “sense ” that the hydrophobic surfaces were more favorable for settlement. The results are discussed in relation to the attachment of microorganisms to substrata having different <b>wettabilities.</b> Enteromorpha spp. are commonly found throughout the world in the upper intertidal regions of shores and estuaries and are the most common macroalgae that foul man-made structures, including boats, buoys, ships, and submarines (6, 7) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} compare the <b>wettabilities</b> of {{different}} fluids on the drilling tool steel, surface tensions of some fluids (including water, white oil, petrodiesel, soybean oil and biodiesel) were determined by a BZY- 1 surface tension meter (Hengping Instrument Factory) which employs the Wilhelmy plate principle. Their contact angles on a smooth, clean surface of G 105 steel (commonly used for drill pipes) in the air were also measured by an optical contact angle tester (Xiamen Chongda Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd.), respectively.|$|R
25|$|CNTs {{can store}} {{about the same}} charge as {{activated}} carbon per unit surface area, but nanotubes' surface is arranged in a regular pattern, providing greater <b>wettability.</b> SWNTs have a high theoretical specific surface area of 1315m2/g, while that for MWNTs is lower and {{is determined by the}} diameter of the tubes and degree of nesting, compared with a surface area of about 3000 m2/g of activated carbons. Nevertheless, CNTs have higher capacitance than activated carbon electrodes, e.g., 102F/g for MWNTs and 180F/g for SWNTs.|$|E
25|$|Tin-based solders readily {{dissolve}} gold, forming brittle intermetallics; for Sn-Pb alloys {{the critical}} concentration of gold to embrittle the joint is about 4%. Indium-rich solders (usually indium-lead) are {{more suitable for}} soldering thicker gold layer as the dissolution rate of gold in indium is much slower. Tin-rich solders also readily dissolve silver; for soldering silver metallization or surfaces, alloys with addition of silvers are suitable; tin-free alloys are also a choice, though their <b>wettability</b> is poorer. If the soldering time is long enough to form the intermetallics, the tin surface of a joint soldered to gold is very dull.|$|E
25|$|Bismuth {{significantly}} {{lowers the}} melting point and improves <b>wettability.</b> In presence of sufficient lead and tin, bismuth forms crystals of Sn16Pb32Bi52 with melting point of only 95°C, which diffuses {{along the grain}} boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an alloy of lead can therefore desolder under load when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also prone to cracking. Alloys with more than 47% Bi expand upon cooling, which {{may be used to}} offset thermal expansion mismatch stresses. Retards growth of tin whiskers. Relatively expensive, limited availability.|$|E

25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs), {{also called}} buckytubes, are carbon molecules with a cylindrical nanostructure. They have a hollow structure with walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of graphene. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("chiral") angles, {{and the combination}} of chiral angle and radius controls properties such as electrical conductivity, electrolyte <b>wettability</b> and ion access. Nanotubes are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs). The latter have one or more outer tubes successively enveloping a SWNT, much like the Russian matryoshka dolls. SWNTs have diameters ranging between 1 and 3nm. MWNTs have thicker coaxial walls, separated by spacing (0.34nm) that is close to graphene's interlayer distance.|$|E
25|$|The cyprid larva is {{the last}} larval stage before adulthood. It is not a feeding stage; its role {{is to find a}} {{suitable}} place to settle, since the adults are sessile. The cyprid stage lasts from days to weeks. It explores potential surfaces with modified antennules; once it has found a potentially suitable spot, it attaches head-first using its antennules, and a secreted glycoproteinous substance. Larvae assess surfaces based upon their surface texture, chemistry, relative <b>wettability,</b> colour, and the presence/absence and composition of a surface biofilm; swarming species {{are also more likely to}} attach near other barnacles. As the larva exhausts its finite energy reserves, it becomes less selective in the sites it selects.
