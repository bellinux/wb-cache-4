25|$|Such changes, they argue, {{include not}} just {{well-known}} physical and biological adaptations such as skin colour, disease resistance, and lactose tolerance, but also personality and cognitive adaptations that {{are starting to}} emerge from genetic research. These may include tendencies towards (for example) reduced physical strength, enhanced long-term planning, or increased docility, all of {{which may have been}} counter-productive in hunter-gatherer societies, but become favoured adaptations in a world of agriculture and its resulting trade, governments and urbanization. These adaptations are even more important in the modern world, and have helped shape today's nation states. The authors speculate that the scientific and Industrial Revolutions came about in part due to genetic changes in Europe over the past millennium, the absence of which had limited the progress of science in Ancient Greece. The authors suggest we <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> fewer adaptive changes among the Amerindians and sub-Saharan Africans, who have farmed for the shortest times and were genetically isolated from older civilizations by geographical barriers. In groups that had remained foragers, such as the Australian Aborigines, there would presumably be no such adaptations at all. This may explain why Indigenous Australians and many Native Americans have characteristic health problems when exposed to modern Western diets. Similarly, Amerindians, Aboriginals, and Polynesians, for example, had experienced very little infectious disease. They had not evolved immunities as did many Old World dwellers, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world.|$|E

In his opinion, the episode {{never failed to}} deliver and [...] "acts {{as a tribute to}} everything Russell T Davies put in place when he resurrected the series in 2005." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "fast-moving, bursting [...] excitement" [...] and said that it contained [...] "everything you <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> from an adventure [...] all companions and a new Dalek empire" [...] and [...] "acts as the ultimate climax to four years of storytelling and will leave you with goose bumps for the full 42 minutes." [...] Blair was impressed about how Torchwood and Doctor Who crossed over when their original target demographics dictated it [...] "should never have happened", and commended scenes that depicted Gwen's concern for her husband Rhys, Ianto watching The Paul O'Grady Show, and Sarah's and Jack's emotional response to the Dalek transmission. Although his review {{was positive}}, he did criticise two parts of the episode: the concept of [...] "time-lock" [...] the Time War was questioned because the Time Lords were annihilated in the conflict; and he complained that the Doctor's phone number was out of service.|$|E
500|$|Speirs was {{captain of}} the side and in the days up to the final {{he wrote to his}} {{opposite}} number, Colin Veitch. The contents of his letter are not known, but in his reply, Veitch said Speirs had [...] "expressed in sound terms the true spirit of comradeship, and the proper sentiments one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> associated with the sportsman, and the sport". Speirs led out a team which contained eight Scots for the final at the Crystal Palace on 22 April 1911 against Newcastle United. The game ended in a 0–0 draw, in what was described as a [...] "decidedly dull and uneventful game". The final replay was played four days later at Old Trafford, Manchester, with City making [...] one change to the team, bringing in Bob Torrance for fellow Scottish defender Willie Gildea. After 15minutes, Speirs scored {{what turned out to be}} the only goal of the game to win the cup. Robinson shot at goal, but the wind caught the ball, which was headed on by Frank Thompson. Speirs himself headed the ball at goal, and Newcastle's goalkeeper Jimmy Lawrence was distracted by City striker Frank O'Rourke and the ball rolled into the net. Speirs lifted the newly-cast trophy, which had been made by Bradford jewellers Fattorinis, and displayed it on the club's victory parade later that evening in Bradford. The following day, Speirs was pictured on the front page of the Daily Mirror newspaper, holding the cup.|$|E

500|$|One dispute {{among the}} founders of Century 21 – Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Reg Hill and John Read – emerged from the filming of other scenes, {{including}} {{one in which the}} character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower. Read, the director of photography, had complied with Parrish's instructions to light the sequence in silhouette. Anderson, who had intended the scene to display full-frontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl, demanded a re-shoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners. According to Sylvia Anderson, [...] "Gerry was very keen to show that {{he was part of the}} 'Swinging Sixties' and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more 'with it' than the more subdued version." [...] Anderson clashed with Read and Parrish for a second time when special effects shots of Phoenix were filmed with a hand-held camera: [...] "I knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die... told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this kind of movement." [...] Refusing to re-film the scenes on the basis that Parrish's instructions had precedence over Anderson's, Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons' and Hill's request. Anderson elaborated: [...] "Clearly John was in a difficult position. I do now understand how he must have felt, but in my heart I feel he couldn't play a double role." ...|$|E

The top portion of the image shows the central portion of the pattern formed when a red laser illuminates a slit and, if one looks carefully, two faint side bands. More bands can be seen with a more highly refined apparatus. Diffraction explains the pattern as being the result of the interference of light waves from the slit.|$|E
