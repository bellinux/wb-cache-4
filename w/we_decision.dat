40|$|There are {{different}} theories {{that try to}} explain the decision making process. These theories set out some possible decision scenarios.

40|$|Intermediate goods {{make up a}} {{large share}} of world trade. Yet trade models with {{heterogeneous}} firms focus almost exclusively on firms’ export decisions rather than their import <b>decisions.</b> <b>We</b> develop an analytically solvable model of a small open economy in which heterogeneous firms make endogenous import <b>decisions.</b> <b>We</b> view <b>decisions</b> about importing as decisions about technology adoption. In our model, firms weigh the benefit of operating a technology that uses imported intermediate goods against the fixed cost of developing trade relationships with foreign input suppliers. Similar to the selection effect in standard export-decision models, only the most efficient firms choose to import. In addition, the model features a technology upgrading effect, where importing improves a firm’s labor efficiency. The calibrated model quantifies the selection and technology upgrading effects, captures the large performance advantage associated with using imported intermediate goods, and generates large increases in trade from small decreases in tariffs. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To handle known {{values and}} data <b>we</b> have {{traditional}} <b>decision</b> trees. Decision tree {{is used for}} classification technique. <b>We</b> propose a <b>decision</b> tree based classification for uncertain data. Data uncertainty is commonly exists in many applications during data collection, such as measurement/quantisation errors, data staleness, and multiple repeated measurements. With the use of uncertainty value of data is not represented by single value, but by multiple values forming a probability distribution. In this paper <b>we</b> extend traditional <b>decision</b> tree algorithms to handle both certain data and uncertain datasets. Here the uncertainty is handled by considering the probability density function (pdf). The resulting classifiers are more accurate than the traditional one. we can use these algorithms for handling both categorical data as well as numerical data also...|$|R
