After Lwaxana and the Millers are welcomed aboard the Enterprise, the parents argue over whose cultural traditions <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>honored</b> at the ceremony.

500|$|Several of the Olympian Gods—Artemis, Hades, Helios, Hermes, and Poseidon—decide {{to enter}} into a wager with Ares. Each will choose a {{champion}} who is in search of the Ambrosia, with the successful god receiving an award (e.g., having statues erected in their honor across Greece). Kratos kills two of the champions—Herodius and Pothia—and repels attacks by monsters sent by the gods to thwart him. A desperate Hades kills Nikos, who sacrifices himself to save Kratos, passing on the rank of Captain. Danaus is killed by Alrik, who retains Danaus' head to possess his magical ability. Kratos locates the [...] "Tree of Life", the source of the Ambrosia located on a small island, and confronts Cereyon. After being almost burned alive, Kratos drowns his foe and successfully retrieves the Ambrosia, but as he leaves, he and his Spartan troops are ambushed by Alrik's horde of barbarians. When Hades observes the Spartans defeating the Barbarians, the god attempts to have the Spartans dragged to the Underworld. Alrik uses the head of Danaus to summon rocs to attack Kratos as he flies away on a similar bird with the stolen Ambrosia. Kratos pursues Alrik on a captured roc, knowing that although his men will be taken to the Underworld, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>honored</b> in Sparta for their sacrifices. Alrik and Kratos battle, with Alrik critically wounding Kratos. The Spartan, however, is sprayed by the [...] Ambrosia [...] and subsequently healed.|$|E
2500|$|On May 23, 2013, Senator Rob Portman {{introduced}} the World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2013 (S. 1044; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would direct the United States Secretary of the Interior to install at the World War II memorial in the District of Columbia a suitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of D-Day. The bill was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Hindu American Foundation, and the Interfaith Alliance. Together the organizations argued that the bill [...] "endorses the false notion that all veterans <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>honored</b> by a war memorial that includes a prayer proponents characterize as reflecting our country's 'Judeo-Christian heritage and values.'" [...] The organizations argued that [...] "the memorial, as it currently stands, appropriately honors those who served and encompasses the entirety of the war" [...] and was carefully created, so no additional elements, such as FDR's prayer, need to be added. But, they said, [...] "the effect of this bill, however, is to co-opt religion for political purposes, which harms the beliefs of everyone." [...] The bill passed in the United States Senate on June 5, 2014.|$|E
