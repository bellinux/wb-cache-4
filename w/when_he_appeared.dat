5|$|However, {{right after}} Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became {{chairman}} of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to {{freedom of the press}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|Jimmy Cowie set two goalscoring {{records in}} 1928–29 which, {{as of the}} date above, still stand; he scored 56 goals in all competitions, and 49 league goals in as many matches in the Midland League. The first player capped at full {{international}} level while with the club was Eamon Dunphy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> for the Republic of Ireland against Spain on 10 November 1965.

5|$|TNA {{management}} {{were very}} upset with Sean Waltman after {{he failed to}} appear {{to participate in the}} Four Way Elimination Tag Team match. This anger was due to Waltman being one-half of the winners of the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament. Despite not appearing on the show, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time. Waltman was not used by TNA until January15, 2006 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> at their Final Resolution PPV event.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Reubens {{decided to}} take a sabbatical from Pee-wee. In July 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent {{exposure}} in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida. The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public's view of Reubens and Pee-wee. The arrest postponed Reubens' involvement in major projects until 1999 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow and started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.|$|E
5|$|Tittle {{became the}} first {{professional}} football player featured {{on the cover of}} Sports Illustrated <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> on its fifteenth issue dated November 22, 1954, donning his 49ers uniform and helmet featuring an acrylic face mask distinct to the time period. The cover photo also shows a metal bracket on the side of Tittle's helmet which served to protect his face by preventing the helmet from caving in. The 1954 cover was the first of four Sports Illustrated covers he graced during his career.|$|E

Although Johnston originally performed as a treble, his voice has since matured to baritone, {{and he is now}} a member of the National Youth Choir.|$|E
5|$|During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing {{more than}} half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs at a better average {{than anyone else in the}} side. In county matches, Hutton {{averaged}} 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen. Hutton's main challenge that season came from the Australian side which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In the early part of the tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton's confidence by targeting him. Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire's match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> for MCC shortly after.|$|E

5|$|Each player's details {{include the}} {{duration}} of his Arsenal career, his typical playing position while with the club, {{and the number of}} games played and goals scored in all senior competitive matches. Two of these players, Tom Whittaker and Don Howe, went on to manage Arsenal; the former died in 1956, while in the job. The first player capped at full international level while with Arsenal was Caesar Jenkyns, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> for Wales against Scotland on 21 March 1896. Bernard Joy moved into journalism following his football career, and authored the club's first detailed history book, Forward, Arsenal! Ronnie Rooke made 94 appearances for Arsenal and scored 70 goals; at a goalscoring rate of 0.745, he is the club's second-most prolific goalscorer.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} time in as many serials the title role was played by a {{different}} actor, this time by André Morell; the part had initially been offered to Alec Clunes, but he declined it. Morell had a reputation for playing authority figures, such as Colonel Green in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> as O'Brien in their BBC television adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954). He had been the first actor offered the part of Quatermass, for the original serial The Quatermass Experiment in 1953; he turned the part down. Morell's portrayal of Quatermass has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|His {{first-class}} {{career was}} confined to his university years, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> for both Oxford and Somerset. Close {{to the top of}} the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 first-class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of first-class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's first-class career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed first-class cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols. He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|It was Daniel Craig's {{performance}} in Our Friends in the North that first {{brought him to}} the attention of producer Barbara Broccoli, who later cast him in the role of secret agent James Bond in the long-running film series. Christopher Eccleston also later went on to achieve notoriety in a cult screen role <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> as the Ninth Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who in 2005. Since then various media articles have noted the coincidence of the future James Bond and Doctor Who leads having co-starred in the same production earlier in their careers.|$|E

He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
