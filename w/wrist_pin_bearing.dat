40|$|Connecting rod and crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> are {{important}} components of automotive diesel engine. If these components failed, all of engine {{system would be}} shut down. In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting rod and crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch and chipping on crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> which formed by high friction during operation. High friction affects performance of other pistons and therefore bolts of connecting rod experienced dynamic tension load. With repeated load during operation, crack initiated on the bolts and propagated until the bolt could not withstand the load anymore before they are finally broken...|$|R

50|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine is acted upon by {{the pressure of the}} expanding combustion gases in the combustion chamber space {{at the top of the}} cylinder. This force then acts downwards through the connecting rod and onto the crankshaft. The connecting rod is attached to the piston by a swivelling gudgeon <b>pin</b> (US: <b>wrist</b> <b>pin).</b> This pin is mounted within the piston: unlike the steam engine, there is no piston rod or crosshead (except big two stroke engines).|$|R
5000|$|... 2 Stroke Engines {{generally}} have smaller bearing overlap between the main and the <b>pin</b> <b>bearings</b> {{due to the}} larger stroke length, hence increasing {{the flexibility of the}} Crankshaft due to decreased stiffness.|$|R

The joint's required ultimate line load is of the of 82, 000 lb/in. By optimizing composite layup, and the ratios of pin diameter/specimen thickness, edge distance/pin diameter, and specimen width/pin diameter, a <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> joint strength of 85 ksi was obtained.

5000|$|As <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> and pistons rely for {{lubrication}} {{and cooling}} respectively, {{on the oil}} being splashed around in the crankcase, these parts might have inadequate oiling if too much oil is pulled away by the pump. Installing piston oilers can circumvent this issue, but do so with additional cost and complexity for the engine.|$|R

In terms of the film parameter, the operating condition that can result in solid–solid contact is investigated. We also suggest the desirable operating conditions of clearance and lubricant temperature to prevent the solid–solid contact.|$|R

50|$|The {{unique design}} of this bikes piston makes {{cylinder}} maintenance difficult, as aftermarket companies (as of 2016) do not manufacture replacements and new old stock (NOS) parts are not widely available. Due to this, {{it is common}} practice to install the nearly identical 88-04 pistons in these bikes, which share both <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> and piston diameter measurements. Doing so will lower the compression ratio, but still function. Cylinders from later bikes are not compatible.|$|R

5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journal and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journals, the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|R
