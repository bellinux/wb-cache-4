50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>admission</b> is only {{possible}} {{in the event of}} compliance with formalities. The court will only allow withdrawal if satisfied that it was a bona fide mistake, and that there is no prejudice to opposing party.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> {{applies only to}} Arriving Aliens who present themselves for admission at a port of entry, whereas voluntary return applies to people apprehended or stopped at a land border. In particular, the offices within CBP that handle these are different: <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application for}} <b>admission</b> is handled by the CBP Office of Field Operations whereas voluntary returns are handled by United States Border Patrol.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> {{is an option}} that U.S. Department of Homeland Security might offer to an Arriving Alien whereby the alien chooses to withdraw his or her application to enter the United States, and immediately departs the United States. Unlike an order of removal (including expedited removal as well as orders obtained {{as a result of}} removal proceedings), a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application for}} <b>admission</b> does not create a bar to future entry.|$|R

50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> {{is an alternative}} to expedited removal (when carried out by CBP) or removal proceedings (when {{carried out by the}} Immigration Judge). Whereas <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application for}} <b>admission</b> requires the consent of both the authorities (CBP or the Immigration Judge) and the alien, expedited removal does not require the alien's consent. An alien who refuses to withdraw the application for admission may instead be subject to expedited removal (by the CBP) or removal through an order by the Immigration Judge.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{a formal}} <b>admission</b> in {{criminal}} trial is possible, if the formalities have been complied with, but a withdrawn admission {{may still have}} some evidentiary value.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{humanitarian}} {{or public}} interest considerations: Such considerations, where applicable, may lead CBP {{to be more}} willing to allow a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> application for <b>admission</b> than it otherwise would.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> {{is carried out}} through the issuing of immigration forms (I-275, etc.) whereas voluntary return requires no signed statement and in general involves less formality.|$|R
50|$|For Lawful Permanent Residents seeking {{re-entry}}, the LPR may {{be denied}} re-entry due to living outside the United States {{for over a}} year, or due to criminal activity that makes him or her inadmissible. In the case of LPRs who are being denied re-entry solely on account of living outside the United States for long but do not otherwise have any blemish on their immigration record, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> application for <b>admission</b> is usually offered as an option, both by CBP and by the Immigration Judge. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> application for <b>admission</b> is entered on Form I-407, along with a Voluntary Relinquishing of Permanent Residence.|$|R
5000|$|Talented {{students}} from each district are selected through an All India Level Entrance Exam conducted {{each year by}} CBSE and are given admission to 6th standard/class in the JNVs of respective districts. Till 1998, the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Selection Test (JNVST) was conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training, however it is conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education ever since. The test is largely non-verbal and objective in nature and is designed to prevent any disadvantage to children from rural areas. Now admissions are also taken in Class IX and XI. During academic year 2008-09 admissions will be allowed in Class VIII. These admissions are conducted through an objective and descriptive test containing questions on English, Mathematics, Science, & Social Sciences.

50|$|An alien who {{receives}} {{an order of}} removal is subject to a re-entry bar that may be five, ten, or twenty years depending on the circumstances. In contrast, there are no re-entry bars in case <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> application for <b>admission.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The option <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> {{is offered by}} CBP {{at the discretion of}} the officers involved.

5000|$|Prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act <b>of</b> 1996, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> was not recognized in any statute or regulation.

50|$|Voluntary {{departure}} {{should also}} {{not be confused}} with <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> application for <b>admission,</b> that occurs when an Arriving Alien who would be denied entry at a port of entry or deferred inspection site is asked to withdraw his or her application instead of receiving an order of removal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> is typically granted only {{in cases where}} the CBP officer involved genuinely believes that the alien did not engage in misrepresentation or try to break the law or conceal information, but voluntary return may be granted even in cases where it is believed that the applicant may have been trying to violate immigration law.|$|R
5000|$|For {{people who}} are not United States Lawful Permanent Residents, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> is officially noted on Form I-275, <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> Application for Admission/Consular Notification. The Form I-275 has two pages. The first page includes the alien's biographical information and the reasons why the application would have been denied. The second page includes a signed statement by the alien acknowledging that he or she has read the reasons the application would be denied, and is choosing to withdraw the application.|$|R
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} <b>of</b> a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application for}} <b>admission</b> {{is that it}} constitutes consent on the alien's part to the charges made in the Form I-275, and therefore {{makes it harder for}} the alien to challenge or appeal the finding. Expedited removal orders can be challenged with the CBP (though not appealed) and the findings of removal proceedings allow for appeals with the Board of Immigration Appeals.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the statutory framework for alien removal and briefly describes the standard removal process. It also describes several streamlined forms of removal, and two alternative forms of removal (often referred to as returns) that exempt aliens from certain penalties associated with formal removal: voluntary departure and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> petition for <b>admission.</b> In addition, the report discusses recent trends in removals and returns, and concludes with a summary of potential avenues for relief from removal...|$|R
5000|$|Matter of Gutierrez (1988) {{clarified}} {{that the}} alien needed {{to demonstrate to}} the IJ {{that he or she}} would immediately depart the United States {{in order to be able}} to withdraw the application. It also clarified that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> application for <b>admission</b> should not be construed as a form of relief from removal. Further, if excludability (now called inadmissibility) were established, the approval of the INS (now the U.S. Department of Homeland Security) was needed to allow withdrawal.|$|R
5000|$|The alien {{is found}} inadmissible: The officer may discretionarily allow the alien to {{withdraw}} the application for admission, to which the alien {{may or may not}} consent. The officer may also issue an order of expedited removal against the alien, or put the alien through removal proceedings. In the case <b>of</b> a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> application for <b>admission</b> or order <b>of</b> expedited removal, the original Form I-259 issued at the port of entry can be used to compel the alien's carrier to return the alien.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> and voluntary return, voluntary departure requires the alien {{to leave the}} United States, but does not put a removal order on the alien's record, thereby avoiding the bars to entry that a removal order would create. However, voluntary departure differs from the other processes in that its scope is not merely limited to arriving aliens. It can also apply to aliens who were admitted to the United States lawfully or entered unlawfully. Any days of unlawful presence acquired are not removed if the alien undergoes voluntary departure.|$|R
50|$|In cases <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> using an entry visa, the visa remains intact where {{the reason for}} inadmissibility does not extend to invalidating the visa. An example {{would be if the}} alien simply forgot to bring along all the necessary documentation while traveling but has it at home. On the other hand, if the reason for inadmissibility also implies that the visa should not be issued, the visa is invalidated and the applicant needs to apply for a visa again with the consulate. Regardless of whether the visa is invalidated, the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application for}} <b>admission</b> does not directly invalidate any underlying USCIS application or petition (such as Form I-129 or Form I-130), or other form (such as Form I-20 for students) that was a prerequisite to obtaining the visa.|$|R
50|$|In summary, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>admission</b> {{is suitable for}} cases where an alien may have innocently or through ignorance, misinformation, or bad advice, obtained an inappropriate visa but has not concealed the true purpose of the trip. For instance, an alien who entered on a visa whose expiration date is not yet reached, but {{that is no longer}} valid because the underlying status is now void, may be asked to withdraw the {{application for}} admission. For lawful permanent residents, the option to withdraw the application for admission may be offered in cases where the LPR appears to be inadmissible on account of having been outside the United States {{for a long period of}} time.|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court of Appeal {{dealt with}} the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> an <b>admission</b> in civil {{proceedings}} in Saayman v Road Accident Fund 2011 (1) SA 106 (SCA). The court (para [12]) held that a concession made {{during the course of}} counsel’s address did not amount to a formal admission. Consequently, it was not necessary for an application for a formal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the statement to be made. It was possible for the concession be withdrawn {{at any time during the}} trial in the absence of prejudice to the opposing party. Heher JA (Leach JA and Majiedt AJA concurring), agreeing with the majority judgment of Bosielo JA, gave a separate judgment providing additional grounds and it is in this judgment that the court expands on the characteristics <b>of</b> an <b>admission.</b> The first hurdle to overcome in following this aspect of the judgment is to determine whether the court views the arguments presented as pertaining to informal or formal admissions. The court explicitly characterizes the relevant statements as informal admissions as they were not recorded as admissions by the court. In doing so the judges refer to section 5 of the Civil Proceedings Evidence Act 25 of 1965, which is somewhat confusing, as section 5 has nothing to say on the matter. (This is perhaps due to the fact that DT Zeffertt, AP Paizes and A St Q Skeen (The South African Law of Evidence (2003) 784) mistakenly refer to section 5 when they actually mean section 15. ...|$|R
