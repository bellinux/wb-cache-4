30|$|Clearly, K_ 1 =K <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex. Assume K_n <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex {{for some}} n≥ 1. It {{is easy to}} see that K_n+ 1 ={v∈ K _n: 2 〈 v, Ju_n-Jz_n〉≤ u_n - z_n +ω _n}. Consequently, it <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex. Hence, Step  1 is completed.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{government}} of Tamaulipas, most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents' dwellings, primarily near Matamoros, Valle Hermoso, Reynosa and San Fernando. In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, the main highway through the city <b>was</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane.|$|E
30|$|By Lemmas 2.4 and 2.8 we obtain that SGEP(F_ 1,φ_ 1,F_ 2,φ_ 2) and _i= 1 ^∞F(S_i) <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex subsets of C. Hence Γ <b>is</b> a <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex {{subset of}} C. It follows by Lemma  2.5 that C_n+ 1 <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex for each n∈N.|$|R
30|$|From Theorem  3.1 in [26], we {{see that}} _i= 1 ^∞F(T_i) <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex, which {{combines}} with Lemma  2.3 shows that the common element set F <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex.|$|R
50|$|There were severe traffic {{delays in}} and around Manchester as bridges <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> fallen trees blocked roads. Railway {{stations}} <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> traffic <b>was</b> delayed or not running leaving hundreds of stranded travellers.|$|R
