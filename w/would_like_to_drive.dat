On such occasions I often looked round in alarm. The road was pretty bleak, for we were traversing a sort of high, wind-swept plateau.

Like the 10 team which was co-owned by Valvoline executive James Rocco, sponsor Centrix's owner and racing enthusiast Bob Sutton came on as an equity partner for the 36 car, changing the team name to MB Sutton Motorsports. Said had stated that he <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> the car on a full-time basis if sponsorship was found. Veteran crew chief Frankie Stoddard would lead the 36 team. Said ultimately attempted 12 races, struggling on oval tracks, with a best finish of 27th at Daytona and Texas and three DNQs. He did run well at Talladega in May, qualifying 12th and running in the top 15 before a 25-car pileup ended his day with 35 laps remaining. Boris was, however, strong as always in his road course element. At Sonoma in June, Said was running well {{when he entered the}} pits while they were closed after a caution was thrown with 40 laps to go. Sent back to 32nd place, he made it up to 13th place with 10 laps to go, but was relegated to a 17th-place finish after a caution with 7 laps to go. Said shined later in the year at Watkins Glen, starting 41st after qualifying was rained out, and racing with NASCAR Road Course aces Tony Stewart and Robby Gordon for the win.

40|$|Abstract—A {{multi-tenant}} software as {{a service}} (SaaS) system has {{to meet the needs of}} several tenant organizations, which connect to the system to utilize its services. To leverage economies of scale through re-use, a SaaS vendor <b>would,</b> in general, <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> commonality amongst the requirements across tenants. However, many tenants will also come with some custom requirements that may be a pre-requisite for them to adopt the SaaS system. These requirements then need to be addressed by evolving the SaaS system in a controlled manner, while still supporting the requirements of existing tenants. In this paper, we focus on functional variability amongst tenants in a multi-tenant SaaS and develop a framework to help evolve such systems systematically. We adopt an intuitive formal model of services that is easily amenable to tenant requirement analysis and provides a robust way to support multiple tenant onboarding, which is modeled as a bi-objective optimization problem that attempts to maximize vendor profit and tenant functional commonality. We perform a substantial case study of a multi-tenant blog server to demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach. I...|$|R
60|$|All this foreign {{life must}} be {{exterior}} to the aboriginal Spanish life which has so long outlasted the Moorish, {{and is not}} without hope of outlasting the English. I {{do not know what}} the occupations and amusements of that life are, but I will suppose them unworthy enough. There must be a certain space of neutral life uniting or dividing the two, which would form a curious inquiry, but would probably not lend itself to literary study. Besides this middle ground there is another neutral territory at Gibraltar which we traversed after luncheon, in order to say that we had been in Spain. That was the country of many more youthful dreamers in my time than, I fancy, it is in this. We used then, much more than now, to read Washington Irving, his Tales of the Alhambra, and his history of The Conquest of Granada, and we read Prescott's histories of Spanish kings and adventures in the old world and the new. We read Don Quixote, which very few read now, and we read Gil Blas, which fewer still now read; and all these constituted Spain a realm of faery, where every sort of delightful things did or could happen. I for my part had always expected to go to Spain and live among the people I had known in those charming books, yet I had been often in Europe, and had spent whole years there without ever going near Spain. But now, I saw, was my chance, and when the friend who had been lunching with us asked if we <b>would</b> not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> across that neutral territory and go into Spain a bit, {{it seemed as if the}} dream of my youth had suddenly renewed itself with the purpose of coming immediately true. It was a charmingly characteristic foretaste of Spanish travel that the driver of the state coach which we first engaged should, when we presently came back, have replaced himself by another for no other reason than, perhaps, that he could so provide us with a worse horse. I am not sure of this theory, and I do not insist upon it, but it seems plausible.|$|R
40|$|If {{the speed}} limits in the Netherlands {{would never be}} exceeded, this would lead to 10. 000 less {{injuries}} and 250 less fatalities. The speed limits are however exceeded massively. Most people seem {{to think of the}} speed limit as an indication of an acceptable speed. Subsequently one chooses an appropriate speed which is often higher than the speed limit. A possible cause for at least a part of these speeding offences is that the current limits are not considered as credible. The research considered here is aimed to increase the insight in speed choice. The influences of road features, the road environment and especially of a person's characteristics and personality on this choice were examined. It was examined whether the speed limit was just as credible for one person as for another and whether this was dependent on individual differences. Previous research indicated that there are relations of gender and age with driving behaviour. There also was found to be a relation between the score on a Sensation Seeking scale and driving behavior. For the current study, a questionnaire was used which was presented on a personal computer. The questionnaire consisted of 35 photographs of roads, each with the same 3 questions about speed, 11 general questions about personal characteristics (e. g. gender and age), and a short version of a Dutch translation of a Sensation Seeking scale, consisting of 20 multiple choice items. The degree of the credibility of the speed limit was determined by the discepancy between the 3 questions at the pictures. There questions were: With which speed <b>would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> here if there wasn't a speed limit?; Which speed limit do you think would be safe here?; What do you think the legal speed limit is on this road? The speed limit was found to be not credible. However, the degree of this credibility differed individually. The speed limit is found to be more credible by older people than for young people. It is found to be less credible for people with more speeding offences, less credible for sensation seekers than for sensation avoiders, less credible for people that possess their drivers license longer and the speed limits are also less credible for people from {{the northern part of the}} Netherlands compared to the rest of the Netherlands.

60|$|He {{finished}} his day's work {{and got on}} a tram {{to go back to}} Kennington. He wondered how Mildred would behave that evening. It was a nuisance to think that she would probably be surly and refuse to answer his questions. It was a warm evening for the time of year, and even in those gray streets of South London there was the languor of February; nature is restless then after the long winter months, growing things awake from their sleep, and there is a rustle in the earth, a forerunner of spring, as it resumes its eternal activities. Philip <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> on further, it was distasteful to him {{to go back to his}} rooms, and he wanted the air; but the desire to see the child clutched suddenly at his heartstrings, and he smiled to himself as he thought of her toddling towards him with a crow of delight. He was surprised, when he reached the house and looked up mechanically at the windows, to see that there was no light. He went upstairs and knocked, but got no answer. When Mildred went out she left the key under the mat and he found it there now. He let himself in and going into the sitting-room struck a match. Something had happened, he did not at once know what; he turned the gas on full and lit it; the room was suddenly filled with the glare and he looked round. He gasped. The whole place was wrecked. Everything in it had been wilfully destroyed. Anger seized him, and he rushed into Mildred's room. It was dark and empty. When he had got a light he saw that she had taken away all her things and the baby's (he had noticed on entering that the go-cart was not in its usual place on the landing, but thought Mildred had taken the baby out;) and all the things on the washing-stand had been broken, a knife had been drawn cross-ways through the seats of the two chairs, the pillow had been slit open, there were large gashes in the sheets and the counterpane, the looking-glass appeared to have been broken with a hammer. Philip was bewildered. He went into his own room, and here too everything was in confusion. The basin and the ewer had been smashed, the looking-glass was in fragments, and the sheets were in ribands. Mildred had made a slit large enough to put her hand into the pillow and had scattered the feathers about the room. She had jabbed a knife into the blankets. On the dressing-table were photographs of Philip's mother, the frames had been smashed and the glass shivered. Philip went into the tiny kitchen. Everything that was breakable was broken, glasses, pudding-basins, plates, dishes.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2006. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: OnTime is a {{passenger}} transport {{company that was}} established in 1999 when the insurance giant Sanlam decided to outsource its transport services for its top officials. This document examines the challenges that OnTime faces as it seeks to grow its market by acquiring business from more corporates in order to lessen its dependence on Sanlam. The chauffeur industry in Cape Town is characterised {{by a lack of}} regulation and, as a result, there is no official data {{that can be used to}} describe the size of the industry. The lack of regulation means competition among industry players favours the two big companies to the detriment of the smaller ones. Smaller companies are constantly experiencing dwindling profits because of the dominance of these two big companies. At the other extreme, there are many pirate operators who compete on price by undercutting everyone else. The industry as a whole is experiencing growth due to the increasing number of corporations and government departments which have outsourced their passenger transport services for their top officials. While this move to outsource the passenger transportation is supposed to create new opportunities for small companies to benefit from the new business being generated, it appears that the smaller passenger transport companies have not yet benefited from this extra business. The main reason is that smaller passenger companies have been created without adequate support systems or a steady client base to sustain them through their early growth phase. On the flip side, the two big passenger transport compames are experiencing increasing volumes of business from those very same big corporations which were supposed to be the lifeblood of smaller passenger transport firms. The main reason for the phenomenal business growth for the two passenger transport companies is the fact that they belong to groups of companies which are constantly growing through the acquisition of other companies. The passenger transport unit then provides the transport needs of the entire group. Moreover, these two big passenger transport service providers have fonned alliances with most of the major airlines, hotels, and guest houses in order to be in a position to capture any business that flows from these airlines and hospitality service providers. In an industry where customers are conscious of the type of vehicles they are driven in, it is not surprising that the two big passenger transport companies are able to offer a variety of vehicles from which customers can choose. This is in sharp contrast to the small passenger transport companies whose fleet size limits the options they can offer their customers when it comes to choosing the type of vehicles they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be <b>driven</b> in. The findings contained in this document will influence the recommendations for formulating a business strategy for OnTime. The main challenge for OnTime is to grow its business by implementing drastic changes...|$|R
6000|$|Francie remembered now--she had {{forgotten}} it--Margaret de Cliche's having {{told her she}} meant to come again. She hoped the marquise thought by this time that, on canvas at least, she looked a little more like a lady. Mme. de Cliche smiled at her at any rate and kissed her, as if in fact {{there could be no}} mistake. She smiled also at Mr. Flack, on Francie's introducing him, and only looked grave when, after she had asked where the others were--the papa and the grande soeur--the girl replied that she hadn't the least idea: her party consisted only of herself and Mr. Flack. Then Mme. de Cliche's grace stiffened, taking on a shade that brought back Francie's sense that she was the individual, among all Gaston's belongings, who had pleased her least from the first. Mme. de Douves was superficially more formidable, but with her the second impression was comparatively comforting. It was just this second impression of the marquise that was not. There were perhaps others behind it, but the girl hadn't yet arrived at them. Mr. Waterlow mightn't have been very much prepossessed with Mr. Flack, but he was none the less perfectly civil to him and took much trouble to show him the work he had in hand, dragging out canvases, changing lights, moving him off to see things {{at the other end of}} the great room. While the two gentlemen were at a distance Mme. de Cliche expressed to Francie the conviction that she would allow her to see her home: on which Francie replied that she was not going home, but was going somewhere else with Mr. Flack. And she explained, as if it simplified the matter, that this gentleman was a big editor. Her sister-in-law that was to be echoed the term and Francie developed her explanation. He was not the only big editor, but one of the many big editors, of an enormous American paper. He was going to publish an article--as big, as enormous, as all the rest of the business--about her portrait. Gaston knew him perfectly: it was Mr. Flack who had been the cause of Gaston's being presented to her. Mme. de Cliche looked across at him as if the inadequacy of the cause projected an unfavourable light upon an effect hitherto perhaps not exactly measured; she appealed as to whether Francie thought Gaston <b>would</b> <b>like</b> her <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> about Paris alone with one of ces messieurs. [...] "I'm sure I don't know. I never asked him!" [...] said Francie. [...] "He ought to want me to be polite to a person who did so much for us." [...] Soon after this Mme. de Cliche retired with no fresh sign of any sense of the existence of Mr. Flack, though he stood in her path as she approached the door. She didn't kiss our young lady again, and the girl observed that her leave-taking consisted of the simple words [...] "Adieu mademoiselle." [...] She had already noted that in proportion as the Proberts became majestic they became articulately French. She and Mr. Flack remained in the studio but a short time longer, and when they were seated in the carriage again, at the door--they had come in Mr. Dosson's open landau--her companion said [...] "And now where shall we go?" [...] He spoke as if on their way from the hotel he hadn't touched upon the pleasant vision of a little turn in the Bois. He had insisted then that the day was made on purpose, the air full of spring. At present he seemed to wish to give himself the pleasure of making his companion choose that particular alternative. But she only answered rather impatiently: ...|$|R
