His father later {{abandoned}} the family, prompting his maternal grandmother to take care of Abel.

They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ...

60|$|My brother Henry was {{six months}} old at that time. I used to {{remember}} his walking into a fire outdoors {{when he was a}} week old.

If I had stopped to reflect, I should not have burdened my memory with that impossible rubbish so long. It is believed by many people that an impression deposited in a child's memory within the first two years of its life cannot remain there five years, but that is an error. The incident of Benvenuto Cellini and the salamander must be accepted as authentic and trustworthy; and then that remarkable and indisputable instance in the experience of Helen Keller--however, I will speak of that at another time.
