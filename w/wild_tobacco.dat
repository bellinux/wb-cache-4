Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood.

40|$|Nicotine, the {{signature}} alkaloid of Nicotiana species {{responsible for the}} addictive properties of human tobacco smoking, functions as a defensive neurotoxin against attacking herbivores. However, {{the evolution of the}} genetic features that contributed to the assembly of the nicotine biosynthetic pathway remains unknown. We sequenced and assembled genomes of two <b>wild</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> Nicotiana attenuata (2. 5 Gb) and N. obtusifolia (1. 5 Gb), two ecological models for investigating adaptive traits in nature. We show that after the Solanaceae whole genome triplication event, a repertoire of rapidly expanding transposable elements (TEs) bloated these Nicotiana genomes, promoted expression divergences among duplicated genes and contributed to the evolution of herbivory-induced signaling and defenses, including nicotine biosynthesis. The biosynthetic machinery that allows for nicotine synthesis in the roots evolved from the stepwise duplications of two ancient primary metabolic pathways: the polyamine and nicotinic acid dinucleotide (NAD) pathways. While the duplication of the former is shared among several Solanaceous genera which produce polyamine-derived tropane alkaloids, the innovation and efficient production of nicotine in the genus Nicotiana required lineage-specific duplications within the NAD pathway and the evolution of root-specific expression of the duplicated Solanaceae-specific ethylene response factor (ERF) that activates the expression of all nicotine biosynthetic genes. Furthermore, TE insertions that incorporated transcription factor binding motifs also likely contributed to the coordinated metabolic flux of the nicotine biosynthetic pathway. Together, these results provide evidence that TEs and gene duplications facilitated the emergence of a key metabolic innovation relevant to plant fitness...|$|R

40|$|Previously {{described}} transgenic tobacco lines {{express the}} full length infectious Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) genome under the 35 S promoter (Siddiqui et al., 2007. Mol Plant Microbe Interact, 20 : 1489 – 1494). Through their young stages these plants exhibit strong resistance against both the endogenously expressed and exogenously inoculated TMV, but {{at the age of}} about 7 – 8 weeks they break into TMV infection, with typical severe virus symptoms. Infections with some other viruses (Potato viruses Y, A, and X) induce the breaking of the TMV resistance and lead to synergistic proliferation of both viruses. To deduce the gene functions related to this early resistance, we have performed microarray analysis of the transgenic plants during the early resistant stage, and after the resistance break, and also of TMV-infected <b>wild</b> type <b>tobacco</b> plants. Comparison of these transcriptomes to those of corresponding wild type healthy plants indicated that 1362, 1150 and 550 transcripts were up-regulated in the transgenic plants before and after the resistance break, and in the TMV-infected <b>wild</b> type <b>tobacco</b> plants, respectively, and 1422, 1200 and 480 transcripts were down-regulated in these plants, respectively. These transcriptome alterations were distinctly different between the three types of plants, and it appears that several different mechanisms, such as the enhanced expression of the defense, hormone signaling and protein degradation pathways contributed to the TMV-resistance in the young transgenic plants. In addition to these alterations, we also observed a distinct and unique gene expression alteration in these plants, which was the strong suppression of th...|$|R

Again, using a heat shock assay, we show that tobacco cell cultures with elevated levels of peroxidase have higher cell death induction threshold levels than <b>wild</b> type <b>tobacco</b> cell cultures. Thus, assessing PCD associated morphological changes can report on the effect of altering peroxidase genes on cell death activation in tobacco.

40|$|Plants can {{attenuate}} the {{replication of}} plant viruses and viroids by RNA silencing induced by virus and viroid infection. In higher plants, silencing signals such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced by RNA silencing can be transported systemically through phloem, {{so it is}} anticipated that antiviral siRNA signals produced in a stock would {{have the potential to}} attenuate propagation of viruses or viroids in the scion. To test whether this is indeed the case, we prepared transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) expressing a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) of Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) in companion cells by using a strong companion cell-specific promoter. A grafting experiment of the <b>wild</b> type <b>tobacco</b> scion {{on the top of the}} transgenic tobacco stock revealed that accumulation of PSTVd challenge-inoculated into the scion was apparently attenuated compared to the control grafted plants.

First, the effect of high-level expression of the Borrelia burgdorferi outer membrane protein A (OspA), a prototype vac-cine against Lyme disease, has been examined by a proteomics approach. Analysis by 2 D-PAGE of <b>wild</b> type <b>tobacco</b> plants and transplastomic plants accumulating recombinant OspA showed no apparent differences in protein pattern ex-cept for OspA. However, presence of the bacterial signal sequence limits transgene accumulation. As an alternative ap-proach OspA was produced in Nicotiana benthamiana plants by transient expression via a deconstructed tobacco mosaic virus-based system. While rapid expression of OspA could be achieved, no palmitoylation occurred with the genuine bac-terial sequence. In contrast, modification of the N-terminus with an eukaryotic sequence motif resulted in palmitoylation of OspA. This study shows that plants provide multiple expression strategies and could serve as a versatile production platform for recombinant lipidated subunit vaccines.

In contrast, the expression of the tokn genes was detected throughout the meristem and in leaf primordia of epiphyllous shoots that developed in tobacco over-expressing the barley hooded gene bkn 3. It was determined that such extended expression domains of resident tobacco knox 1 genes were mediated through an enhanced expression domain of bkn 3 within the tissue confined to the epiphylls, and this contributed to "repeated epiphylly", i. e. an iterated development of epiphyllous shoots on leaves of progenitor epiphylls...|$|R
40|$|Peroxidase and {{hydrogen}} peroxide both play {{important roles in}} the final stages of the lignification pathway. Peroxidase, in the presence of H 2 O 2 catalyses the oxidation of monolignols to give lignin. In order to examine this process we looked at lignification in transgenic tobacco plants expressing a barley peroxidase gene, HvPrx 8, either alone or in combination with a wheat germin gene, g. f 2. 8, which encodes oxalate oxidase, thereby providing a source of H 2 O 2. Elevated activity of the antioxidant ascorbate peroxidase was found in plants expressing oxalate peroxidase and was greatly increased by co-expression with the barley peroxidase, although the latter had no effect when expressed alone. An increase was observed in the oxidation of the lignin monomer, syringaldazine in cell lines over-expressing barley peroxidase, while a decrease was observed in double transformants. Plants over-expressing barley peroxidase have elevated levels of lignin deposition compared to that of <b>wild</b> type <b>tobacco</b> plants. Over-expression of the individual enzymes was also shown to enhance heat-induced programmed cell death (PCD) in cell suspension cultures, an effect which was greatly reduced in the double-expressing lines...|$|R

The prospects for enhancing ROS scavenging, and hence stress tolerance, by direct gene expression in a vulnerable cell compartment, the chloroplast, have been explored in tobacco. Several plastid transformants were generated which contained either a Nicotiana mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) or an Escherichia coli glutathione reductase (gor) gene.
