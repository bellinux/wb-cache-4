50|$|In 2006, an {{elephant}} slaughter was documented in southeastern Chad by aerial surveys. A series of poaching incidents, {{resulting in the}} killing of over 100 elephants, was carried out from May to August, 2006 in the vicinity of Zakouma National Park. This region has a decades-old history of poaching of elephants, which has caused the population of the region, which exceeded 300,000 in 1970, to drop to about 10,000 today. The African bush elephant officially is protected by Chadian government, but the resources and manpower provided by the government (<b>with</b> some European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance)</b> have proven insufficient to stop the poaching.|$|R

In November 2005 two agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority permitted the reopening of the crossing <b>with</b> third-party European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance.</b> However the movement of people would be very restricted and goods should pass through another checkpoint (Kerem Shalom), under the supervision of Israelis and monitored by EU monitors.

5000|$|The Commission {{findings}} regarding government secrecy {{in the early}} Cold War period {{have led to a}} reevaluation of many public perceptions regarding the period.

5000|$|Nuclear weapons {{brought an}} entirely new and terrifying {{possibility}} to warfare: a nuclear holocaust. While at first the United States held a monopoly on the production of nuclear weapons, the Soviet <b>Union,</b> <b>with</b> some <b>assistance</b> from espionage, managed to detonate its first weapon (dubbed [...] "Joe-1" [...] by the West) in August 1949. The post-war relations between the two, which had already been deteriorating, began to rapidly disintegrate. Soon the two were locked in a massive stockpiling of nuclear weapons. The United States began a crash program to develop the first hydrogen bomb in 1950, and detonated its first thermonuclear weapon in 1952. This new weapon was alone over 400 times as powerful as the weapons used against Japan. The Soviet Union detonated a primitive thermonuclear weapon in 1953 and a full-fledged one in 1955.|$|R
