25|$|One {{night while}} working the late shift, he killed a man. Authorities briefly arrested him, but Quantrill {{claimed that he}} had acted in self-defense. Since there were no eyewitnesses and the victim <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> who knew no one in town, William was set free. Nevertheless, the police {{strongly}} urged him to leave Mendota. Quantrill continued {{his career as a}} teacher, moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana in February 1856. The district was impressed with Quantrill's teaching abilities, but unfortunately the wages remained meager. Quantrill journeyed back home to Canal Dover that fall, with no more money in his pockets than when he had left.|$|E
25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger,</b> who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E

500|$|Often one's local (geographic) {{identity}} could outweigh one's {{identity as}} a Rhōmaios. The terms xénos (Greek: [...] ) and exōtikós (Greek: [...] ) denoted [...] "people foreign to the local population," [...] {{regardless of whether they}} were from abroad or from elsewhere within the Byzantine Empire. [...] "When a person was away from home he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> and was often treated with suspicion. A monk from western Asia Minor who joined a monastery in Pontus was 'disparaged and mistreated by everyone as a stranger'. The corollary to regional solidarity was regional hostility." ...|$|E

[...] "y father, my mother, my brothers, and sisters, and friends were [...] But I was free, {{and they should be}} free." [...] She worked odd jobs and saved money. The U.S. Congress meanwhile passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which heavily punished abetting escape and forced law enforcement officials—even in states that had outlawed slavery—to assist in their capture. The law increased risks for escaped slaves, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario (then part of the United Province of Canada), which, as part of the British Empire, had abolished slavery. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as waves of poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale's second film {{appearance}} of 2001 {{was in the}} romantic comedy Serendipity as the love interest of John Cusack. It was filmed directly after Pearl Harbor and Beckinsale found it [...] "a real relief to return to something slightly more familiar." [...] Turan praised the [...] "appealing and believable" [...] leads, adding that Beckinsale [...] "reinforces the strong impression she made in Cold Comfort Farm, The Golden Bowl, and The Last Days of Disco" [...] after [...] "recovering nicely" [...] from her appearance in the much-maligned Pearl Harbor. Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that [...] "Beckinsale's talents haven't been mined as effectively in any other film since Cold Comfort Farm." [...] McCarthy found her [...] "energetic and appealing" [...] while Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times described her as [...] "luminous but determined." [...] In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Ebert described her as [...] "a good actress, but {{not good enough to}} play this dumb." [...] The film has grossed over $77 million at the worldwide box office. In 2002 Beckinsale starred in Lisa Cholodenko's Laurel Canyon as a strait-laced academic who finds herself increasingly attracted to her free-spirited future mother-in-law. The independent film was another opportunity for Beckinsale to work with Christian Bale, her Prince of Jutland co‑star. She found their sex scene awkward because she knew Bale well: [...] "If it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger,</b> it would have been easier." [...] While Frances McDormand's performance as Bale's mother was widely praised, Beckinsale received negative reviews. Holden found the film [...] "superbly acted, with the exception of Ms.Beckinsale, whose tense, colourless Alex conveys no inner life." [...] Schwarzbaum was unimpressed by the [...] "tedious" [...] characters and criticized [...] "the fussy performances of Bale and Beckinsale" [...] in particular. The film has grossed over $4million worldwide.|$|E

[...] The maxim attributed to him, [...] "the pope must be like Melchizedech who had no father, no mother, nor even a family tree", is revealing of his character. [...] Benedict was shy of personal power and was devoted exclusively to restoring the authority of the Church. [...] As a Cistercian, he had a notable theological background and, unlike his predecessor John XXII, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> to nepotism and scrupulous with his appointments.

In 1804 he resigned of his own will, leaving a good memory. That is how Ivan Saltykov is characterized in the book “Biographies of the Russian Generalissimos and the General Field Marshalls” published in 1840: “Having never made anyone miserable in his whole life, Count Ivan Saltykov <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> to shameful pride and despised nobody but arrogant timeservers; he was a cordial host and led a lush life in Moscow: lunches and dinners for 60 persons were served in his house every single day; each Sunday a crowd of 100 guests would come to his ball…He tried to eradicate extortion in government offices, established order and decency, was universally loved and respected and enjoyed bringing good to people.

His literary works were highly esteemed, {{and he was}} sincerely attached to the alliance of the two nations {{and the cause of}} peace. He also secured the return of Napoleon’s ashes to France at the insistence of Thiers. As he himself remarked, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> to England and a novice in diplomacy; the embroiled state of the Syrian War question, on which the French government had separated itself from the joint policy of Europe, and possibly the absence of entire confidence between the ambassador and the minister of foreign affairs, placed him in an embarrassing and even false position. The warnings he transmitted to Thiers were not believed. The treaty of 15 July was signed without his knowledge and executed against his advice. For some weeks Europe seemed to be on the brink of war, until the king ended the crisis by refusing his assent to the military preparations of Thiers, and by summoning Guizot from London to form a ministry and to aid his Majesty in what he termed [...] "ma lutte tenace contre l'anarchie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the fact}} that she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> in the city and because of the rather secluded life she was forced to lead while a boarder at the convent, she found it {{practically}} impossible to do much as a reporter and began editorial work. Conversant with every phase of life, ancient and modern, alive to every new issue, she was especially fitted for such work. She wrote editorials on every conceivable subject, art, literature, science, education, economics and politics. Although the editors accepted her work they still refused to give her a position. Finally, she went to Wilbur F. Storey, editor of the Times, and reminding him that he had never refused her editorials, demanded that she be given a place on the paper. The editor doubted that [...] Buchanan was really the author of the masterly editorials that he had been publishing and to try her, he asked her to write an editorial on the Canadian monetary system. Without a moment's hesitation Buchanan wrote the article assigned. Storey, thoroughly astonished, made a place for her on the paper. “What salary do you expect,” he asked. “The salary of the man whose place I am to take,” Buchanan answered. The answer was typical of her. She never allowed anyone to underestimate her work because she was a woman. Not in the least egotistical, she, nevertheless, realized her ability and no false modesty prevented her from frankly admitting it.|$|E
