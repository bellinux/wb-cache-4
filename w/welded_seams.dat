40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above. Inadequate fulfilment of these conditions, verified by the FEsimulations, is the cause of inferior <b>weld</b> <b>seams,</b> associated with low values of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator.

In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength.

50|$|Engineer Evgeny Paton {{played a}} direct {{role in the}} design and {{construction}} of the bridge. Originally he came up with a revolutionary, even on a global scale, innovative idea of all-welding the structure instead of using the traditional riveted design. The first such road bridge in the world, the Maurzyce Bridge, had been opened only in 1928 and since then the idea was a relative novelty in civil engineering, with only a couple dozen constructions finished before the outbreak of World War II. Paton urged the designers that such approach will greatly improve the reliability of the structure, but initially his idea did not find any support amongst the professionals. Eventually his idea of all-welding did receive the support, as he was given the go-head to start building the bridge by the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Nikita Khrushchev, who personally oversaw the entire operation. The construction of the first span began in early June 1941, but was interrupted by the Great Patriotic War. After the liberation of Kiev by the Red Army on 6 November 1943, construction of the bridge was forced to begin practically from scratch as the retreating German troops blew up all of the existing parts of the incomplete bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was completed {{just in time for the}} 10th anniversary of the liberation of Kiev and was officially opened on the 5 November 1953. Upon the completion, the bridge was composed of 264 identical blocks which are 29 m in length each, held together by <b>welded</b> <b>seams</b> totalling 10668 m.

This passage {{develops}} {{a set of}} arithmetic process for {{the image of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> in flanges, which suits the weld process according to the feature of the seam. In terms of the arithmetic process for image, traditional methods are replaced by the opening and closing of mathematical morphology, which effectively smoothes the interferences of weld points, surface scratches, glistens and false edges, thus forming sharp and smooth image of <b>weld</b> <b>seam.</b> The arithmetic process of image proves to be brief and highly effective, which meets the practical need of the construction supported by the image of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam.</b> This passage also, taking <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> as an example, focuses on the discussion of the erosion and dilation of the opening and closing calculations, which are of great value towards administering the process of processing editing the image...|$|R
