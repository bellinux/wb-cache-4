2500|$|In 1972 a sub-debate on {{the future}} {{cleanliness}} of the Mole was had by Lords involving {{a member of the}} South-East Strategic Committee, of the Thames Conservancy (succeeded by the Environment Agency) and four others. [...] In this it was said [...] "...I can see no future for [...] The Mole Valley has been polluted. The Mole <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> tickle trout in my youth is a drain, and it will remain a drain." [...] Rebuttals included that the Mole is a [...] "charming Surrey steam" [...] and [...] "If Lord Lytton went to fish in the River Mole—and there are still angling clubs there—he would find that he would still be able to catch a trout".|$|E
2500|$|The {{second section}} opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously {{begins with the}} words: [...] "I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for myself, when I start {{thinking}} about my birthplace, Humulești, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels {{at the end of}} it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when I was learning to walk with my head held high, the place on top of the stove <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> hide when we children played at hide-and-seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!" [...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye. The narrator also mentions his regret at not having shown his mother his full appreciation, and refers to childhood as [...] "the merry age".|$|E

In addition, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> calcium imaging <b>to</b> characterize the cellular response of C. elegans to salt. The thesis {{is divided into}} five sections and each section is summarized below. In chapter 1, I discuss the importance of salt for our health and subsequently our current knowledge about the different taste modalities and how their sensations are regulated in mammals and Drosophila. Next, I discuss several sensory behaviours of C. elegans and the signal transduction pathways involved, {{with an emphasis on}} salt chemotaxis. Furthermore, I discuss different types of learning and memory observed in C. elegans and neurotransmitters involved. Finally, I discuss the importance of C. elegans as a model organism and the behavioural and neuronal methods commonly employed to study C. elegans response to salt...|$|R
40|$|From 1 to 10 June 2004 I had the {{opportunity}} of gaining some insights into the RNCST’s 1 work, collaborating with Norbert Ropers and his team on internal and external matters. For this reason I would like to begin this response by expressing my sincere appreciation for everything that they have accomplished there, in all its encouraging ups and disappointing downs. And knowing from personal experience the extremely difficult work involved in peace processes in Armenia, Georgia, post-war Croatia, Northern Ireland and South Africa, I would like to focus here on making a few suggestions in response {{to some of the}} instruments and approaches which Ropers describes. This means focusing on how to avoid interventions which have limited prospects of success, and expanding all the more effectively on others instead. In making these suggestions, I am fully aware of the limits of my perspective and experience. My thoughts and actions draw on ideas from systems theory, which formed the basis of my doctoral thesis in the field of International Relations (Glasl 1967). Coupled with experience as a conflict researcher, consultant and mediator in meso-social systems (organisations, organisational units and inter-organisational relations), these thoughts also flowed into my habilitation thesis (Glasl 1980), <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> them <b>to</b> demonstrate a contingency theory model of conflict dynamics...|$|R
