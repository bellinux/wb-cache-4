5|$|On 17 July 2009, three Congolese men resettled in Norwich {{under the}} {{programme}} <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car crash on the A1 road. The Home Office released a promotional video in October 2009 that highlighted {{the success of}} the programme in resettling the first 15 Congolese families in Norwich in 2006. In 2011, the Home Office stopped using Norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire, reportedly to the disappointment of the local council.|$|E
5|$|Powell, his wife, and Brown <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{car crash}} when {{traveling}} overnight from Philadelphia to Chicago. Powell {{was beginning to}} achieve recognition {{at the time of}} his death, but he never had the chance to record as a leader. He had a playful piano style, and was fond of using musical quotations. His relatively heavy touch and use of left-hand fourths influenced fellow pianist McCoy Tyner.|$|E

5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 people <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{fire at the}} St. Elizabeth's Hospital, {{a mental}} ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most {{of the people who}} lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, iron bars. The cause was attributed to a patient who was lighting curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Fighting was renewed at the {{beginning}} of 1993, as the Croatian army launched Operation Maslenica, an offensive operation in the Zadar area on January 22. The objective of the attack was to improve the strategic situation in that area, as it targeted the city airport and the Maslenica Bridge, the last entirely overland link between Zagreb and the city of Zadar until the bridge area was captured in September 1991. The attack proved successful as it met its declared objectives, but at a high cost, as 114 Croat and 490 Serb soldiers <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relatively limited theater of operations.|$|E

5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{felt that}} the planned {{extermination}} of the Jews was too difficult and important to be entrusted to the military. In 1941 the Einsatzgruppen were sent into the Soviet Union to begin large-scale genocide of Jews, Romani people, and communists. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews. The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppen was at Babi Yar outside Kiev, where 33,771 Jews <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single operation on 29–30 September 1941. In the Rumbula massacre (November–December 1941), 25,000 victims from the Riga ghetto were killed. Another mass shooting early in 1942 claimed the lives of over 10,000 Jews in Kharkov.|$|E
5|$|In 1190, 150 local Jews <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pogrom in {{the castle}} keep, most of them {{committed}} suicide {{in order not to}} fall to the hands of the mob. Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone {{in the middle of the}} 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, {{more than}} 40 people <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fire {{accident}} in a firecracker unit. The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities {{that led to}} the accident. In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E
5|$|In {{early to}} mid-2009, several {{narcotics}} and bomb-making facilities were raided by British forces, supported by Apaches. In April 2009, {{it was reported}} that an Apache had been used to intercept a suicide bombing attack in Helmand province. During the Summer of 2009, British Apaches were an integral component of Operation Panther's Claw, which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in the runup to the 2009 Afghan Elections. During this major offensive, Apaches from the UK routinely flew alongside US Cobra helicopters to provide air support to soldiers of 3rd Battalion Black Watch and the Royal Marines conducting ground operations. During the Summer 2009 operations, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, and several accomplices <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> precision strike launched by an Apache.|$|E
5|$|Jose Sarria {{was born}} to Julio Sarria and Maria Dolores Maldonado. His parents did not marry and his father showed no {{interest}} in his son's life. Maria initially raised José Julio Sarria on her own, but when this became too difficult she placed him with another couple. Both they and his mother indulged his early interest in wearing girl's clothing. Sarria showed an affinity for languages, which led to his first serious romance with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron who had fled from the Nazis. Sarria and Kolish fell in love, and their relationship endured until Kolish and his son <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car accident in 1947.|$|E

5|$|The siege {{continued}} on 6 July. Negotiation talks continued between the besieged Lal Masjid administration and government authorities, without resolution. Twenty-one additional students surrendered to authorities, and two students <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shooting incident. The government decided {{to delay the}} assault, hoping for the safe evacuation of more students from the besieged mosque. President Pervez Musharraf issued an ultimatum {{on the evening of}} 7 July. The Pakistani army took over the operation and replaced the paramilitary troops deployed around the premises. A thirteen-year-old child escaped from the besieged mosque unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Under the two doctors' care, Jodie slowly {{learns to}} control Aiden and the powers they share. During this time, Nathan and Cole are {{building}} the condenser, a portal {{that connects the}} world of the living with {{the world of the}} dead—the Infraworld. One night, Nathan learns that his wife and daughter <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car accident. While trying to comfort him, Jodie discovers that she can channel spirits of the dead from the Infraworld; she helps the spirits speak to the living through a psychic link created by her physical contact. As the years pass, a teenage Jodie (Ellen Page) seeks her independence, both from the doctors and from Aiden, and tries several times to live a normal life. At each attempt, Aiden intervenes, ending in disaster.|$|E

However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was in Mission Control, but under the circumstances there was little he could do.
