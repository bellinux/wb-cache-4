500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{feels that}} episodes such as [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] are his {{favorite}} episodes to write {{because they have}} a [...] "solid theme or an issue" [...] (in this case, religion and theft), that one can [...] "discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways." [...] Producer Jeff Martin said that the writers tried to use a [...] "very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment," [...] considering cable theft to be [...] "essentially a victimless crime." [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment" [...] was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode [...] "Homer the Heretic", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, [...] "remember the Sabbath and keep it holy", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, [...] "We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> to other commandments?" ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> to other commandments. So we thought, 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer {{had a lot of}} fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E
2500|$|If we {{wished to}} factorize the {{polynomial}} [...] <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> for rational roots p/q where p divides â€“6, q divides 2 and p and q have no common factor greater than 1. By inspection {{we see that}} this polynomial can have no negative roots. Assume that q = 2 (otherwise we would be looking for integer roots), substitute x = p/2 and set the polynomial equal to 0. By multiplying by 4, we obtain the polynomial equation [...] that will have an integer solution of 1 or 3 if the original polynomial had a rational root of the type we seek. Since 3 is a solution of this equation (and 1 is not), the original polynomial had the rational root 3/2 and the corresponding factor (2x - 3). By polynomial long division we have the factorization ...|$|E

60|$|From {{the summit}} of this range, which is nowhere more than a {{thousand}} feet in height, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see, <b>looking</b> northward, such a scene of bleakness and desolation as can hardly be matched in any country.|$|R
60|$|As Master Hunt {{said again}} and again when talking over the {{situation}} with Captain Smith, it seemed strange even to us who were there, that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be <b>looking</b> forward to a famine, when in the sea and on the land was food in abundance to feed half the people in all this wide world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} sure about Peter yet," [...] said Clayton to Mr. Jones. [...] "But if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into his very soul I am afraid he could not do much for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he said, [...] "that {{money you}} lost {{to me at}} picquet--What was it? Ten? Twenty? Twenty pounds, wasn't it? Well, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> on that as canceled, of course. That will be all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|If Darius {{had been}} captured, {{then it was}} in the [...] "stone house" [...] he must be confined, and I {{believed}} our search would be at an end if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into every portion of that building.|$|E

6000|$|The {{question}} {{seemed to}} vex Halleck; {{he did not}} answer at once. His mother {{could not bear to}} see him crossed, and she came to his help against herself and his father, since it was only supposing the case. [...] "I presume," [...] she said, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>looked</b> at it as a missionary work." ...|$|R
5000|$|The guns had to {{have been}} taken off the Pointe. We were looking for any kind of {{evidence}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find and it looked like there were some markings on the secondary road where it joined the main road. We decided to leapfrog. Jack covered me, and I went forward. When I got a few feet forward, I covered him. It was a sunken road with very high hedgerows with trees and bushes and stuff like that. It was wide enough to put a column of tanks in, and they would be well hidden. We didn't see anybody, so we just took a chance, running as fast as <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> <b>looking</b> over the hedgerow. At least we had the protection of the high hedgerows. When it became my turn to look over, I said, [...] "God, here they are!" [...] They were in an orchard, camouflaged in among the trees.|$|R
60|$|Away on {{the western}} rim, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> down upon a long rugged iron-gray ridge of mountain, our guide using the glass, found two big stags. We all had our fill of looking. I could see them plainly with naked eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{occasion}} for that," [...] Desmond said. [...] "We can easily move one of the pallets under it, pile the other straw beds upon it, and, standing on these, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> out comfortably, for our shoulders would be well above the ledge." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{doubtful}} which side got the worst drubbing, although we claimed a victory because the others ran; but positive {{it is that}} the four of us had all the punishment needed, and were forced to wash our faces more than once before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at each other without a certain feeling of shame.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost since I {{heard of}} her! She {{was like a}} {{daughter}} to my aunt at Beauchamp, and her brother was my schoolfellow. For one summer, when I was quartered at Hertford, I was with her constantly, but my family would not even hear of the indefinite engagement that was all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>looked</b> to, and made me exchange into the --th." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seeing {{that these}} heathen {{are so many}} and we are so few, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>look</b> for better terms," [...] I said, [...] "as I hope they will think at Constantinople. At least the prisoners shall sail when all is in order. Now for another matter. Have you inquired as to the Bishop Barnabas and the Egyptian Prince Magas and his daughter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|For Mother Earth she gathers all [...] Into her bosom, {{great and}} small. [...] Ah! <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> into her face, [...] We should not shrink from her embrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{we got to}} the top {{we found}} a broad terrace, with a wall along the front edge of it, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> down upon the river and the town. The town lay very narrow between the river and the foot of the hill. We were up very high above the tops of the houses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{your friend}} Silas {{told me they}} were to meet there," [...] and then it seemed as if he was on the point of saying {{something}} more; but if such had been his intention he checked himself right suddenly, walking silently by my side until we were come to that point on the shore from whence <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> under the wharf.|$|E
60|$|The lantern {{was still}} burning. None {{of us had}} been minded to {{extinguish}} the flame when we laid down to rest, because of the doubts which assailed us all, and therefore it was <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into each others' faces during that seemingly desperate struggle which was going on above, mutely asking for some solution to what was a fearsome mystery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, say, girl, Mrs. Appleby and I are {{thinking}} of renting one of these here bungalonies, like the fellow says, and I wonder if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take a <b>look</b> at this house, {{to see how it}} looks furnished?" ...|$|R
60|$|In his shorter poems {{it appears}} as if nature could now and then thrust herself even into the bosom of Johnson himself, from whom <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} have <b>looked</b> for such images as {{are to be found}} in the following stanzas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well for us {{both that}} we do know it now, sir. For if we {{believed}} Him now, sir, to be aught but perfect Love, how <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> round here to-night, and not go mad?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was dressed}} within the ten minutes, and came out. The saloon tent had been {{stripped}} of its sides, and had nothing left but its roof; so when we sat down to table <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> out over a noble panorama of mountain, sea and hazy valley. And sitting thus, the sun rose slowly up and suffused the picture with a world of rich coloring.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the pantry}} window, I feel sure," [...] she said, [...] "because {{this house is}} just like Uncle Charles' at Newbridge, and that is their pantry window. The shade isn't down, so if we climbed {{up on the roof}} of that little house <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into the pantry and might {{be able to see the}} platter. Do you think it would be any harm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} knew it was to be given to us. The fellow who did it had seen him leave the satchel with us once, most likely, an' when there was danger of being robbed, {{believed}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> out for it again. It's the last time such a thing will happen, for I'm going to tell Hazelton that I don't want to be mixed up in his business." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mabel {{listened in}} silence until {{her father had}} {{finished}} the arguments he had used with his wife, with the exception only of that relating to the Miss Penfolds' motives in putting in the condition concerning Mabel's marriage. When he ceased speaking she exclaimed indignantly, [...] "Of course, papa, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not take the money, not if it were ten times as much! Why, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> Mrs. Conway and Ralph in the face again! Beside, how <b>could</b> <b>we</b> speak to people one believes to have done such a wicked thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fortunate indeed {{was it for}} us that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> {{into the}} future. Fortunate we had no inkling of all that was to take place between the rivers of York and James {{within the next few}} days, else had our courage failed us entirely. As it was, however, I had great faith Pierre would pull through his scheme successfully, and trusted that the future would show us some way out of this snarl into which we had been so {{suddenly}} plunged.|$|R
30|$|I {{notice that}} as a teacher, Iâ€™m {{becoming}} more humble. I wonder whether the way we train [our students], focused on the white middle-class, really helps Turkish and Moroccan boys, {{because they have a}} different way of working. And I think Dutch companies will have to adapt to their way of working in the coming 10 â€“ 15 Â years. (â€¦) It would {{be interesting to see if}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> critically <b>look</b> at our frame of reference and see if we can use other frames.|$|R
60|$|From the {{captured}} ridge <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> right down into Ladysmith, {{and at the}} first opportunity I climbed up to see it for myself. Only eight miles away stood the poor little persecuted town, with whose fate there is wrapt up the honour of the Empire, and for whose sake so many hundred good soldiers have given life or limb--a twenty-acre patch of tin houses and blue gum trees, but famous to the uttermost ends of the earth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only for a month? I {{mean for}} all the Winter--and the Spring. Why not? One can see nothing in a month. If we are back for the {{shooting}} next year, that would do; and then, of course, we should come here. I should say next Winter--that is, the Winter after the next--we might as well stay with them at the big house, and then <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> about us, you know. I should like a place near to this, because of the hunting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, my love," [...] he argued, [...] "that it is {{for your}} benefit as well as mine that the {{business}} should grow and flourish {{by the addition of}} the new machinery which this little fortune of yours could purchase. The profits could be doubled and trebled, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> forward ere long to holding our heads as high as the richest manufacturers at Leeds and Bradford--while the mere interest in this money invested in consols as at present would be absolutely useless to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By my hilt! lads," [...] cried Aylward, jumping {{upon the}} fallen trunk, [...] "I think that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> {{the girls in}} the eyes if we let the prince cross the {{mountains}} and did not pull string to clear a path for him. It is very well in time of peace to lead such a life as we have had together, but now the war-banner is in the wind once more, and, by these ten finger-bones! if he go alone, old Samkin Aylward will walk beside it." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{enough of}} moralising. Suffice {{it to say}} that we doubled the Cape without sails, without anxiety, without care, and with no triumph whatever,--but not without interest. Calm and sunny though it chanced to be, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> upon that barren, mountainous, rocky shore, without {{reflecting}} that it still is not less now than in days of old, the Stormy Cape, and that danger as appalling as that of yore may sometimes be encountered, while heroism quite as exalted as that of the ancient Portuguese navigators is sometimes displayed by modern Britons.|$|R
60|$|But if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{not be seen}} in them <b>we</b> still <b>could</b> see. <b>Look!</b> Yonder sat Ayesha on a throne, and oh! she {{was awful}} in her death-like majesty. The blue light of the sunken columns played upon her, and in it she sat erect, with such a face and mien of pride as no human {{creature}} ever wore. Power seemed to flow from her; yes, it flowed from those wide-set, glittering eyes like light from jewels.|$|R
