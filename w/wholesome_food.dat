In fact he had been sickly and physically fragile since childhood. In 1720, he travelled to London, England, to consult Dr. Richard Mead, {{one of the most}} fashionable physicians of his time and an admirer of Watteau's work. However, London's damp and smoky air offset any benefits of Dr. Mead's <b>wholesome</b> <b>food</b> and medicines. Watteau returned to France and spent his last few months on the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, where he died in 1721, perhaps from tuberculous laryngitis, at the age of 36. The Abbé said Watteau was semi-conscious and mute during his final days, clutching a paint brush and painting imaginary paintings in the air.|$|E

Betty Driver said of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, <b>wholesome</b> <b>food.</b> I think it is a lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now." [...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking me about it. Then one day, they served hot pot on the menu and everyone thought it was mine!" ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the modern}} era of sales commissaries is {{considered}} to have actually begun in 1867, when enlisted men received the same at-cost purchasing privileges officers had already enjoyed for four decades. No geographic restrictions were placed upon these sales; the commissary warehouse at every Army post could become a sales location, whether they were located on the frontier or near a large city. From the start, commissaries were meant to take on-post retail functions {{out of the hands}} of civilian vendors and post traders and allow the Army to [...] "care for its own." [...] The stores provided <b>wholesome</b> <b>food</b> beyond what was supplied in the official rations, and the savings they provided supplemented military pay. The modern concept of commissary sales stores, which were established to benefit military personnel of all ranks by providing healthful foods at cost, reached its 148th anniversary on July 1, 2015.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to a shift in research focus among food scientists and technologists towards combating chronic hunger problems in the less developed world, IUFoST released its ‘Budapest Declaration’ during its 7th General Assembly in Budapest, Hungary, 1995. Referencing the Joint FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition (Rome, 1992) and its World Declaration on Nutrition, IUFoST declared its determination to minimize hunger and to reduce all forms of malnutrition throughout the world. To do this, IUFoST declared its commitment to work with all other organisations to ensure sustained nutritional well-being for all people in a peaceful, just and environmentally safe world. The declaration further recognised {{the central role of}} food science and technology in ensuring the year-round availability of the quantity and variety of safe and <b>wholesome</b> <b>foods</b> necessary to meet the nutritional needs of the world's growing population.

I also include a location of self and what led me on this journey. Additionally, I examine what health and well-being looks like for the Indigenous population concerning traditional foods, food security with access playing a pivotal role. The third component addresses the contemporary well-being of Aboriginal Peoples and the potential to rejuvenate culture and identity through a new uptake of relations with traditional and <b>wholesome</b> <b>foods.</b> [...] P. ii.
