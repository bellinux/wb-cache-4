5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved to <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of {{the bodies of the}} Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E
25|$|First out was Nafees Iqbal, caught {{behind for}} 15 with the score on 50. Iqbal was unlucky, as the video replays {{suggested}} the ball had bounced {{before going into}} Geraint Jones's gloves, but despite returning to the pitch {{to appeal to the}} umpires, Iqbal had to go. Opener Javed Omar, captain Habibul Bashar and Aftab Ahmed all made half-centuries as it was touch and go as to whether England would <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in the two days. When the seventh wicket fell at 245 in the last over of normal play, it allowed England to claim the extra half-hour. But only one more wicket fell as Bangladesh restored some pride. England wrapped up the game within 20 minutes on the third day, but Bangladesh, albeit against an attacking field had made 316, 27 short of making the hosts bat again.|$|E
25|$|Long poem authors {{sometimes}} find {{great difficulty}} {{in making the}} entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. Ezra Pound {{is an example of}} this dilemma, with his poem The Cantos. As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. Walt Whitman tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in Song of Myself. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.|$|E

500|$|When Adam Knight first appeared, {{there was}} {{internet}} speculation {{he was really}} Smallvilles version of Bruce Wayne, based on {{the combination of the}} name of one of the actors to portray Bruce Wayne/Batman, Adam West, and one of Batman's nicknames, [...] "Dark Knight". The crew stated it was never their intention to reveal Adam Knight to be a young version of Bruce Wayne. The actual intention was for Adam to be Lana's new boyfriend—a legitimate relationship—but the chemistry between Ian Somerhalder and Kristin Kreuk was not working. The creative team decided to bring the character's storyline out of the romantic path and into a [...] "thriller Pacific Heights direction". According to Gough, the character's storyline degenerated into a science fiction story, and when that occurred, they decided they had to <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> quickly.|$|E
500|$|Legrand {{explains}} {{that on the}} day he found the bug on the mainland coastline, Jupiter had picked up a scrap piece of parchment to <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Legrand kept the scrap and used it to sketch the bug for the narrator; in so doing, though, he noticed traces of invisible ink, revealed by the heat of the fire burning on the hearth. The parchment proved to contain a cryptogram, which Legrand deciphered as a set of directions for finding a treasure buried by the infamous pirate [...] "Captain Kidd." [...] The final step involved dropping a slug or weight through the left eye of the skull in the tree; their first dig failed because Jupiter mistakenly dropped it through the right eye instead. Legrand muses that the skeletons may be the remains of two members of Kidd's crew, who buried the chest and were then killed to silence them.|$|E

2500|$|With {{a glimpse}} of the iconic Superman costume in the season nine finale, Peterson {{confirmed}} that the costume will return and play a more prominent role in the final season, even going as far as to hint that the last scene of Smallville will see Clark wearing it.

2500|$|On 5 April, a 3–0 home {{win against}} Telford United took Yeovil to within {{one point of}} winning the Conference title. [...] Before they could <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> they faced Clevedon Town in the semi-finals of the Somerset Premier Cup and a strong Yeovil side was to good for their lower league rivals winning 4–0. Yeovil's {{promotion}} was confirmed before kick-off against Doncaster Rovers, on 12 April, after Chester City's 2–2 draw with Woking. The Glovers celebrated their title, and promotion to the Football League {{for the first time}} in their 108-year history, with an emphatic 4–0 rout of Doncaster at Belle Vue. Yeovil continued their form with a 6–1 win over Burton Albion, on 19 April, with Kevin Gall scoring four. Yeovil's penultimate match of the season saw them travel to face play-off qualifiers Dagenham & Redbridge, a sixth goal in three matches from Kevin Gall and a Kirk Jackson hat-trick saw Yeovil record an impressive 4–0 away win, and their seventh successive win in the Conference a club record at that level. The match also saw the league debut of youth team player Stephen Reed. Yeovil completed their record breaking season against Chester City in front of 8,111 fans, the highest crowd in the Conference that season, and opened the scoring through Kevin Gall with their 100th goal in the Conference but a late equaliser forced them to settle for a 1–1 draw. After recording a further four wins and a draw from their five league matches in April, Johnson was awarded his third manager of the month award of the season, shared with Jim Harvey of Morecambe. Yeovil then faced Taunton Town, on 29 April 2003, in the final of the Somerset Premier Cup played at the home of Clevedon Town, but failed to add the cup to their Conference title losing 2–1.|$|E
