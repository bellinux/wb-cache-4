500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs. I related to it personally more than other songs, and I have so much fun with it. I thought if it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the future.|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, Madonna {{announced}} that she had begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> my music". By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [...] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing." ...|$|E

500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E
2500|$|Rosenberg {{talked about}} the freedom that the series had, saying that it would go [...] "even further in all our storytelling" [...] than what Brian Michael Bendis did in the Alias comic: [...] "That's the beauty of working with Netflix. It's 13 [...] There's no pilot and then getting feedback, {{reaction}} and ratings. You're in this bubble. So, what's the story you want to tell? Where do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> ?" [...] Expanding on this, Rosenberg said that [...] "we start off with [...] incredible source material and Jessica Jones isn’t as {{well known in the}} universe obviously as Daredevil and everyone else, so it really allows for a lot of freedom in there. So there are restrictions in terms of the Marvel niverse of certain rules of mythology, but within that it’s free pass". Rosenberg noted that the final series is very different to the version she developed for ABC because of the different mythology of the MCU.|$|E
