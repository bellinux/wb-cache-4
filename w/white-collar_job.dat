30|$|In {{cities of}} Australia and New Zealand, {{residential}} dispersion has occurred {{but this has}} not led to a similar form of employment dispersion.

2500|$|Much of Karachi's citizenry {{descend from}} Urdu-speaking {{migrants}} from North India who became {{known by the}} Arabic term for [...] "Mohajir" [...] – Muhajir. The first Muhajirs of Karachi arrived in 1946 {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Calcutta Killings and subsequent 1946 Bihar riots. The city's wealthy Hindus opposed the resettlement of refugees near their homes, and so many refugees were accommodated in the older and more congested parts of Karachi. The city witnessed a large influx of Muhajirs following Partition, who were drawn to the port city and newly designated federal capital for its <b>white-collar</b> <b>job</b> opportunities. Muhajirs continued to migrate to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, with Karachi remaining the primary destination of Indian Muslim migrants throughout those decades. The Muhajir community today forms an estimated 48% of Karachi's population. Muhajirs form the bulk of Karachi's middle class. Muhajirs are regarded as the city's most secular community, while other minorities such as Christians and Hindus increasingly regard themselves as part of the Muhajir community.|$|E
