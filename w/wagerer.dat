60|$|But besides {{those who}} are but the thieves of the trade, there is a method as effectual to get money as possible, managed with more {{appearing}} honesty, but no less art, by which the <b>wagerer,</b> in confederacy with the office-keeper, shall lay vast sums, great odds, and yet be always sure to win.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Wagers allow every {{contestant}} to bet {{any number}} of points up to a predetermined maximum, based on 25% of each player's total points. Successful <b>wagerers</b> won that number, and losers forfeited that number.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2008, Betfair {{introduced}} a [...] "Premium Charge" [...] for <b>wagerers</b> whose winnings are particularly high {{compared to the}} amount of commission they pay. Specifically, members whose commission charges amount to less than 20% of their gross profits, and have placed bets in at least 250 markets, are required to pay the additional charge to make up the difference.|$|R
50|$|On October 22, 2009, the Breeder's Cup {{announced}} it had signed simulcasting and licensing agreements with Betfair, a company {{which in turn}} had purchased the horse-racing network TVG in January of that year. The agreement brought in Betfair's customer base of over 2.5 million, {{many of whom had}} legal access to common-pool betting. Betfair handled common-pool wagering at the organization's November 2009 championships, also streaming the events live to both national and international <b>wagerers</b> for the first time. At that point, the World Championship event was being telecast in over 140 countries, through various networks.|$|R
60|$|For example: A town in Flanders, or elsewhere, {{during the}} war is besieged; perhaps at the {{beginning}} of the siege the defence is vigorous, and relief probable, and it is the opinion of most people the town will hold out so long, or perhaps not be taken at all: the <b>wagerer</b> has two or three more of his sort in conjunction, of which always the office-keeper is one; and they run down all discourse of the taking the town, and offer great odds it shall not be taken by such a day. Perhaps this goes on a week, and then the scale turns; and though they seem to hold the same opinion still, yet underhand the office-keeper has orders to take all the odds which by their example was before given against the taking the town; and so all their first-given odds are easily secured, and yet the people brought into a vein of betting against the siege of the town too. Then they order all the odds to be taken as long as they will run, while they themselves openly give odds, and sign polities, and oftentimes take their own money, till they have received perhaps double what they at first laid. Then they turn the scale at once, and cry down the town, and lay that it shall be taken, till the length of the first odds is fully run; and by this manage, if the town be taken they win perhaps two or three thousand pounds, and if it be not taken, they are no losers neither.|$|E
50|$|In {{a thought}} {{experiment}} {{proposed by the}} Italian probabilist Bruno de Finetti {{in order to justify}} Bayesian probability, an array of wagers is coherent precisely if it does not expose the <b>wagerer</b> to certain loss regardless of the outcomes of events on which they are wagering, even if their opponent makes the most judicious choices.|$|E
50|$|He learns, from a wise bard named Cairpre, that Branwen {{really was}} his mother, but {{her real name}} is Elen. He also learns his father serves the king and was turned evil by the {{troublesome}} Rhita Gawr, a spirit who wants to control Fincayra {{before moving on to}} Earth. Cairpre suggests that he visit the dangerous <b>wagerer</b> Domnu, who may be able to help them reach the castle. Emrys plays her game and wagers the only thing of value he has, the Galator, which he has since learned is the one treasure King Stangmar, under the control of Rhita Gawr, doesn't have, and it is more powerful than all the treasures he does. Domnu shrinks him and Shim to allow them to fly on the back of Trouble, Emrys' named merlin, to the castle, where he realizes that his own father is the king who has made a deal to kill him for the safety of his mother in a deal made with Rhita Gawr.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} {{believed}} that some persons made this type of pact just {{as a sign of}} recognizing the devil as their master, in exchange for nothing. Nevertheless, the bargain is considered a dangerous one, as the price of the Fiend's service is the <b>wagerer's</b> soul. The tale may have a moralizing end, with eternal damnation for the foolhardy venturer. Conversely, it may have a comic twist, in which a wily peasant outwits the devil, characteristically on a technical point. The person making the pact sometimes tries to outwit the devil, but loses in the end (e.g., man sells his soul for eternal life because he will never die to pay his end of the bargain. Immune to the death penalty, he commits murder, but is sentenced to life in prison).|$|R
5000|$|Many modern machine {{learning}} methods {{are based on}} objectivist Bayesian principles. [...] According to the objectivist view, the rules of Bayesian statistics can be justified by requirements of rationality and consistency and interpreted {{as an extension of}} logic. In attempting to justify subjective probability, Bruno de Finetti created the notion of philosophical coherence. According to his theory, a probability assertion is akin to a bet, and a bet is coherent only if it does not expose the <b>wagerer</b> to loss if their opponent chooses wisely. To explain his meaning, de Finetti created a thought-experiment to illustrate the need for principles of coherency in making a probabilistic statement. In his scenario, when someone states their degree-of-belief in something, one places a small bet for or against that belief and specifies the odds, with the understanding that the other party to the bet may then decide which side of the bet to take. Thus, if Bob specifies 3-to-1 odds against a proposition A, his opponent Joe may then choose whether to require Bob to risk $1 in order to win $3 if proposition A is found to be true, or to require Bob to risk $3 in order to win $1 if the proposition A is not true. In this case, it is possible for Joe to win over Bob. According to de Finetti, then, this case is incoherent.|$|E
40|$|The Many Gods Objection (MGO) {{is widely}} viewed as a decisive {{criticism}} of Pascal’s Wager. By introducing a plurality of hypotheses with infinite expected utility into the decision matrix, the <b>wagerer</b> is left without adequate grounds to decide between them. However, some have attempted to rebut this objection by employing various criteria drawn from the theological tradition. Unfortunately, such defenses do little good for an argument {{that is supposed to}} be an apologetic aimed at atheists and agnostics. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to offer a defensive strategy of a different sort, one more suited to the Wager’s apologetic aim and status as a decision under ignorance. Instead of turning to criteria independent of the Wager, it will be shown that there are characteristics already built into its decision theoretic structure that can be used to block many categories of theological hypotheses including MGO’s more outrageous “cooked-up” hypotheses and “philosophers’ fictions”.
