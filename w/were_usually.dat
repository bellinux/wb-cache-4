5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{new sources}} of {{education}} arose. Choir and grammar schools were designed to train priests, with an emphasis respectively on music and Latin grammar.

Early examples of grammar schools include the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. These <b>were</b> <b>usually</b> attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church.
