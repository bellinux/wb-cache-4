5|$|Many popular modern {{accounts}} of the war claim {{that there was a}} factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, <b>who</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, <b>who</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This appears to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.|$|E

30|$|The {{following}} {{results are}} based on the first and third questions, which refer to students’ aspiration to study and work. These questions highlight the intersection between the academic and vocational tracks that FVB students face after graduation. Because there are also many FVB students <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> do both (study and work), three groups were created: (1) FVB students <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> study but not work (study group), (2) FVB students <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> work but not study (work group) and (3) FVB students <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> work and study (mixed group). The two variables (aspiration to study and aspiration to work) were dichotomised (1 and 2  = “wish to study/work”, 3 and 4  = “don’t <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> study/work”).|$|R

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, <b>who</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one.|$|E

As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E

Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410.

5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists <b>who</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
