25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to produce a vacuum.|$|E

The original Constitutions drawn up by Father Rauzan affirmed the belief that one goes surely to Jesus through Mary. Placing ourselves under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we profess our Final/Perpetual Vows on August 15th, the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to schedule all of our Ordinations on a Marian feast day.|$|E
25|$|In clock tree {{optimization}} (CTO) clock can be shielded so {{that noise}} is not coupled to other signals. But shielding increases area by 12 to 15%. Since the clock signal is global in nature the same metal layer used for power routing {{is used for}} clock also. CTO is achieved by buffer sizing, gate sizing, buffer relocation, level adjustment and HFN synthesis. <b>We</b> <b>try</b> to improve setup slack in pre-placement, in placement and post placement optimization before CTS stages while neglecting hold slack. In post placement optimization after CTS hold slack is improved. As a result of CTS lot of buffers are added. Generally for 100k gates around 650 buffers are added.|$|E
30|$|Moving to the 100, 000 -node graphs, <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> {{the same}} {{settings}} {{used for the}} 10, 000 -node graphs. The most common {{problem was that the}} maximum accuracy setting for the 10, 000 -node graphs was very slow when used with the 100, 000 -node graphs. In that case, <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> slightly faster/less accurate settings. In all cases, <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> to find a setting that would cluster 100, 000 -node Graph 6 with at least 90 % accuracy. If that did not succeed, <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> to find a setting where the clustering for Graph 6 at least did not fail. Preliminary work for this paper appeared in [25], and those timings were used as an indication of what should be considered reasonable.|$|R

25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous ideas is that <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies {{at the root of}} feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E
25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E
25|$|Head motion {{correction}} {{is another}} common preprocessing step. When the head moves, the neurons under a voxel move and hence its timecourse now represents largely that {{of some other}} voxel in the past. Hence the timecourse curve is effectively cut and pasted from one voxel to another. Motion correction tries different ways of undoing this to see which undoing of the cut-and-paste produces the smoothest timecourse for all voxels. The undoing is by applying a rigid-body transform to the volume, by shifting and rotating the whole volume data to account for motion. The transformed volume is compared statistically to the volume at the first timepoint {{to see how well}} they match, using a cost function such as correlation or mutual information. The transformation that gives the minimal cost function is chosen as the model for head motion. Since the head can move in a vastly varied number of ways, {{it is not possible to}} search for all possible candidates; nor is there right now an algorithm that provides a globally optimal solution independent of the first transformations <b>we</b> <b>try</b> in a chain.|$|E

25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E
