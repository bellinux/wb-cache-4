40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{a series}} of large scale {{repeated}} model load tests are performed on geocell reinforced and unreinforced base layers overlying <b>weak</b> <b>sand</b> subgrades. The <b>weak</b> <b>sand</b> subgrades are prepared at 30 % relative density (RD) through pluviation (sand raining) technique in a test tank of dimensions 1 m × 1 m × 1 m (length × width × height). Two different base courses consisting of 75 % RD sand and a granular base material have been tested. The 75 % RD sand base course is also prepared by pluviation technique, while the granular base course is prepared in 5 layers, each of 50 mm thick, by static compaction. A repetitive load of 0. 97 kN and 9. 7 kN was applied on the prepared base layer through a 150 mm diameter plate to replicate the traffic load equivalent to a contact pressure of 550 kPa. Loading was applied through a graphical user interfaced multi-purpose test software along {{with the help of}} a hydraulic power unit, hydraulic service manifold and sophisticated double acting linear dynamic 100 kN capacity actuator which is connected to a 3. 5 m high, 200 kN capacity reaction frame. Four different tests are conducted on both the base courses (75 % RD sand and granular base) with and without reinforcement overlying the <b>weak</b> <b>sand</b> subgrade separately. There is a considerable amount of improvement observed for different number of cycles and plate settlements on quantification of traffic benefit ratios (TBR), cumulative plastic deformations (CPD) and rut depth reduction (RDR) for geocell reinforced base courses.

40|$|Shelly {{carbonate}} sands proliferate {{in regions}} of the world where construction of offshore structures is in high demand. These structurally <b>weak</b> <b>sands</b> have high intra-granular voids and complex angular grain shapes. To improve the understanding of the mechanical properties of the material, a detailed morphological quantification is required. This paper presents a three-dimensional characterisation of the morphology of shelly carbonate sands based on analyses of X-ray computed tomography images. Two sands from the Persian Gulf with distinct grading were investigated. An adaptive watershed segmentation technique was developed to identify the individual grains for subsequent grain-scale analysis, which overcomes the challenges posed by the intricate microstructure of these sands. Non-invasive measurements of size, intra-granular void and various shape parameters were carried out, and statistical analyses were conducted, to characterise the grains. The results help to better understand the mechanisms of grain interlocking, and the role of grain angularity and intra-granular void ratio on the mechanical behaviour of shelly carbonate sands...|$|R

The control of sand flow from unconsolidated formations {{can be one of}} the most critical problems in well completion, because holes in weakly consolidated sandstone tend to collapse. Wellbore collapse problems can result in a vertical wellbore completion that performs better than a horizontal completion. It must also be recognized that a workover to remove sand from a horizontal hole may be extremely difficult to perform and very expensive. Remedial efforts will also be endangered by fluids loss to the formation over the long productive interval. Formation damage in most horizontal wells may not reduce performance to that of a vertical well in the same reservoir, but if the reservoir is a weakly consolidated sandstone the hole will tend to collapse and cause untenable problem.

The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the effect of bottom sediments on the {{selected}} properties of light soil as well as the content of trace elements in tested plants. The bottom sediments collected from the Besko reservoir were added to the soil in an amount of 5 %, 10 %, 30 % and 50 % of air-dried sediment, in relation to dry soil mass. The pot experiment was conducted on a light soil, with <b>weak</b> loamy <b>sand</b> grain size composition and slightly acid reaction, which was enriched with a supplement of bottom sediment. The test plant was a maize, Bora c. v. An applied bottom deposit revealed in its composition a considerable content of clay fractions, alkaline reaction and low total heavy metal content. Therefore, it may be applied as an admixture to light soils to improve their productivity. The addition of sediment to light soil resulted in the improvement of acidification in soil indicators: increased soil pH and reduced value of hydrolytic acidity, as well as improved sorption properties. A non-uniform effect of bottom sediment admixture on the content of trace elements in maize was determined. The sediment added to the soil increased the content of copper, nickel, chromium and, decreased the contents of zinc and cadmium in shoots. We did not find any excess of the permissible content of metals in plants used as animals forage in the maize biomass. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Since {{the horrific}} attacks on September 11 th 2001, the United States {{government}} and research community have {{been focused on}} how to better protect US assets across the Globe. This push for safety led the research community to develop ?F 2656 - 07 Standard Test Method for Vehicle Crash Testing of Perimeter Barriers? in 2007 which standardized the method of validating a perimeter security barrier?s ability to withstand an impact from an attacking vehicle. Many of these security barriers rely on weak cohesionless soils to stop attacking vehicles. Designers currently rely heavily on hand calculations and engineering judgment when sizing these installations. This simplified analysis is generally used because of the complex nature of these soils under impact. These soils could be simulated in advanced finite element simulations; however, traditional modeling techniques will not allow for the simulation of these complex behaviors. Due to the complex nature of these simulations, new modeling techniques need to be evaluated and their use needed to be perfected. From this, a new method for creating a predictive simulation of a low speed impactor into a weak cohesionless soil was generated. This paper presents {{the development of a}} method by which a predictive simulation was created using only standard soil tests parameters. This paper also presents measured data from physical impact tests utilized to validate the method by which the simulation was generated.

Through both logistic regression and clas-sification tree models, we compared the characteristics of 29 known sand lance locations to 58 randomly selected sites. The best models indicated a strong selection of shallow water by <b>sand</b> lance, with <b>weaker</b> association between <b>sand</b> lance distribution and beach shorelines, sand bot-toms, distance to shore, bottom slope, and distance to the nearest sand bottom. We applied an information-theoretic approach to {{the interpretation of the}} logistic regression analysis and de-termined importance values of 0. 99, 0. 54, 0. 52, 0. 44, 0. 39, and 0. 25 for depth, beach shorelines, sand bottom, distance to shore, gradual bottom slope, and distance to the nearest sand bottom, respectively.

The unique spatial position of interface between the sea and land, and consequent environmental extreme conditions, result in original, sensitive, and valuable habitats, distributed along a well marked littoral-inland psammophilic gradient. This vegetation shows a notorious succession of segregated communities, (geopermasig-metum), that follows a clear geomorphological zonation (embryonic, primary and semi-stabilized dunes). The thermophilic conditions, the sea salt influence, the wind, the mobility of the sand, the waves action and the oligotrophic conditions, determine the occurrence of specific and highly adapted plant associations, confinedto that specific type of habitat, having few species in common with other terrestrial ecosystems.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to connect the Large Scale Coastal Behaviour (LSCB) of the Rhône delta (shoreface {{sediment}} budget, river sediment input to the beaches, climatic change) with the impact and efficiency of hard engineering coastal structures. The analysis of the 1895 to 1974 bathymetric maps as well as 2 D modelling of the effect of wave blocking on longshore transport allows us to draw up a conceptual model of the LSCB of the Rhône delta. The river sand input, settled in the mouth area (prodeltaic lobe), favours the advance of adjacent beaches. There is however a very <b>weak</b> alongshore <b>sand</b> feeding of the non-adjacent beaches farther off the mouth. After a mouth shift, the prodelta is eroded by aggressive waves and the sand is moved alongshore to build spits. This conceptual model suggests that there is a “timeshift” between the input of river sediments to the sea and the build up of a beach (nonadjacent to the mouth). Nowadays, as the river channels are controlled by dykes and human interventions, a river shift is not possible. It thus appears unlikely that the river sediments can supply the beaches of the Rhône delta coast. Under these conditions, we must expect that the problems of erosion will continue at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and on the Faraman shore, in areas with chronic erosion where the shoreline retreat has been partially stopped by hard engineering practices in the 1980 s. Therefore, these arti. cially stabilised sectors remain potentially under threat because of pro. le steepening and downdrift erosion evidenced in this paper by bathymetric profile measurements. In the long-term (1905 to 2003), the temporal analysis of the storm surges and the sea level show very weak but reliable increasing trends. Thus, these climatic agents will be more aggressive on the beaches and on the coastal structures calling their ef. ciency into question. We also evidence that the hard engineering structures were built in a favourable climatic context during the 1980 s meanwhile the storm surges and the sea-level rise are stronger since the 1990 s. Regarding to the LSCB of the Rhône delta, and the impact of hard engineering coastal structures, we suggest that classical hard coastal protections are not the best option to protect the coast...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has encountered significant problems in the production of oil and gas from weak rocks (such as chalks and limestones) and from unconsolidated sand formations. Problems include subsidence, compaction, sand production, and catastrophic shallow water sand flows during deep water drilling. Together these cost the petroleum industry {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} annually. The goals of this first quarterly report is to document the progress on the project to provide data on the acoustic imaging and mechanical properties of soft rock and marine sediments. The project is intended to determine the geophysical (acoustic velocities) rock properties of weak, poorly cemented rocks and unconsolidated sands. In some cases these weak formations can create problems for reservoir engineers. For example, it cost Phillips Petroleum 1 billion dollars to repair of offshore production facilities damaged during the unexpected subsidence and compaction of the Ekofisk Field in the North Sea (Sulak 1991). Another example is the problem of shallow water flows (SWF) occurring in sands just below the seafloor encountered during deep water drilling operations. In these cases the unconsolidated sands uncontrollably flow up around the annulus of the borehole resulting in loss of the drill casing. The $ 150 million dollar loss of the Ursa development project in the U. S. Gulf Coast resulted from an uncontrolled SWF (Furlow 1998 a,b; 1999 a,b). The first three tasks outlined in the work plan are: (1) obtain rock samples, (2) construct new acoustic platens, (3) calibrate and test the equipment. These have been completed as scheduled. Rock Mechanics Institute researchers at the University of Oklahoma have obtained eight different types of samples for the experimental program. These include: (a) Danian Chalk, (b) Cordoba Cream Limestone, (c) Indiana Limestone, (d) Ekofisk Chalk, (e) Oil Creek Sandstone, (f) unconsolidated Oil Creek sand, and (g) unconsolidated Brazos river <b>sand.</b> These <b>weak</b> rocks and <b>sands</b> are intended to represent analogs to the formations that present oil and gas engineers with problems during oil and gas production and drilling operations.

40|$|Dams are an {{essential}} part of the Dutch flood defence works to protect the hinterland from flooding by the sea. Sand closures are the construction of closure dams with sand as the main building material. The rising and falling tide generates a current through the closure gap, which increases in strength as the gap becomes smaller. This current is quite strong and transports a significant amount of sand from the gap to areas where the current is <b>weaker.</b> The <b>sand</b> that is transported away from the closure gap is called the sand loss. The changing tide and constantly moving sand grains result in a dynamic environment. This makes it difficult to estimate the total amount of sand that is necessary to close the dam. It is important to be able to assess the amount of sand loss accurately, because it could make the difference between needing an extra dredging vessel or not. The costs of these dredging vessels are about 1 million euro's a week; therefore, having an unnecessary vessel present due to very conservative sand loss predictions is costly. Laboratory experiments and a numerical model were used to investigate the morphology during bedload transport under a lateral expansion. A streamwise bar formed behind the tip of the lateral expansion for both the laboratory experiments and the numerical simulations. However, it was not possible to replicate the bedforms that occurred during the laboratory experiments with the numerical model. These bedforms are deemed to be important for the morphology during bedload transport. The numerical model was used to expand the research to suspended sediment transport by decreasing the grain size of the sediment. In the obtained morphological patterns, four areas are distinguished where the morphology was found to depend on the flow velocity and the degree of turbulence in the flow. It is expected that a variation of these patterns can be found during a sand closure, although these findings should be validated with a laboratory experiment or in situ measurements. Therefore, it is recommended to set up a laboratory experiment to investigate the morphology under a mixing layer for suspended sediment transport. Based on the results of the laboratory experiments and the numerical model, it is advised to look into the possibility to use the sand deposited as a streamwise bar during a sand closure as an additional borrow pit to aid the closure process, since it would lead to less sailing time for the dredging vessels. For the first stage of a sand closure, it is advised to use a two-dimensional model that incorporates a bedload transport formula to model the sediment transport. It is important to use a parametrization of the bedforms that occur during bedload transport. For the final stage of a sand closure, which is the most critical phase due to high flow velocities, high degree of turbulence and time restriction, it is advised to use a three-dimensional model with a pick-up equation that takes the influence of turbulence on the grains into account, such as the pick-up formula of Okayasu et al...|$|R
40|$|Cyrogenic Tar Sand Separation {{is a novel}} {{technique}} to access the vast energy potential of the Alberta Tar Sands. In this process tar sand is ground at about - 50 (DEGREES) C. At this temperature the tar is more brittle and <b>weaker</b> than the <b>sand.</b> Thus, the tar is liberated from the sand and ground to fine particles, which can {{be separated from the}} sand. The technical performance of this process was studied, and a general grinding and liberation model was developed, which simulates this and other two component grinding processes.;Four grinding/separation techniques were studied: Fluidized Bed Grinder (a stirred fluidized bed with steel balls) and Spouted Bed grinding combined with tar entrainment, and High Speed Impeller and Ball Mill grinding combined with sieving. The spouted bed gave the highest quality of separation, with a tar purity of 84 %, at a tar recovery of 90 %. The ball mill gave the lowest separation quality with a tar purity of 60 % at 80 % tar recovery, and 35 % at 90 % recovery. A maximum tar recovery of 94 %, at a tar purity of 65 %, was obtained in the fluidized bed grinder. The spouted bed gave the lowest rate of separation, with a typical processing time of 14 hours to obtain 90 % tar recovery, versus 2 - 7 hours for the other mills. However, proposed modifications should increase this rate substantially.;In the grinding and liberation model, a distinction is made between tar sand agglomerates, containing more than one sand grain, and single sand particles, coated with a thin tar layer. Grinding of each particle type is described by a set of conventional first order rate equations, although with non-normalized breakage distribution functions for the agglomerates. The processes are interconnected by a continuous transfer of agglomerate grinding products to the tar coated sand particles. The simultaneous attrition of the tar layer on the sand particles is described by a fourth order rate equation, {{as a function of the}} remaining tar.;Simulation, using this model and experimentally determined parameters, gave an excellent agreement with measured size distributions (from 63 - 2000 (mu) m) and tar concentrations (as a function of particle size and processing time), and provided substantial insight into the various tar sand separation experiments...|$|R

In terms of stress changes and growth of a plastic radius defining shear-failure zone, the effects of different stability factors, including capillarity through water-oil menisci, pore pressure changes due to the variations of fluid relative permeabilities, and loss of strength through chemical reactions of water-sensitive cementation materials, are quantified and compared in order to clarify when and how they contribute to sand production after water breakthrough. The nonlinearities of rock elastic properties in stressed and biphasic fluid environments is analytically addressed, based on an improved nonlinear theory that considers both a failure-based mechanism and a confining-stress-based mechanism, the strength model, and the coupled stress model. The calculations demonstrate the redistributions of stress-dependent rock stiffness around a wellbore and its evolution with increase of water saturation, clarify {{the relative importance of}} each mechanism in reducing rock stiffness, and fundamentally explain why current predictive technologies are invalid when water appears in a flowing wellbore. To quantify the effect of well shut-down on rock stability, the redistributions of fluid pressure in reservoir are analytically solved and coupled with the stress model, while the water hammer equations provide a boundary condition for the bottom-hole pressure. This approach allows direct solution of the relationships among fluid properties, rock properties and production parameters, within the context of rock stability. The proposed new approaches and models can be applied to evaluate sand production risk in multiphase and unsteady fluid flow environment. They can also serve as points of departure to develop more sophisticated models, or to develop more useful constitutive laws for numerical solutions...|$|R
5000|$|Wave {{pounding}} is a {{force of}} erosion along coast lines. The effects of wave pounding are influenced by wave shape, ocean chemistry, rock type, and morphology of the costal landscape.There are three different types of waves to consider in this process. There are spilling, plunging, and surging waves. Spilling waves have {{the least amount of}} energy associated with them due to their shallow ocean floor. Plunging and surging waves contain the energy associated with wave pounding. Plunging and surging waves occur on moderate to steep angled beach plains. Along with energy, the water chemistry will also {{have an impact on the}} rock exposed to the erosion. Salt, calcium, and acid levels in the ocean have adverse affects on specific rock types. The chemical weathering due to wave processes is part of why wave pounding is so damaging.Wave pounding is not primarily caused by tectonic margins. Wave pounding will occur any place around the world as long as the angle of the beach plain is steep enough to generate the plunging and surging waves.The action of wave pounding is the kinetic energy delivered by waves fracturing or removing rock and or sand from land sea margins. Any solid material not fully removed by this action will be hydraulically fractured as well. The surging water fills the existing cracks and physically wedges the rock apart.One specific rock is particularly susceptible to the hydraulic action.Chert rock, or any other rock which has fractured and has had siliceous material fill in the cracks, seems to be very weak to wave action. The water can get into the bubbles and voids in the quartz fracture lines. Some beaches in northern California have broken cliff side with these same fracture patterns on the break line.Some shorelines with wave pounding have large sand deposits and loosely consolidated sand cliffs. Waves in these areas can be extra damaging due to the suspended sand material in the water. These sand cliff faces don’t fracture in the same way that solid rock will.Examples on the northern California coast line suggest that the water erodes the <b>weakest</b> veins of <b>sand</b> on the cliff face. This effectively carves out notches and weak points of the cliff leaving a large scale of sandstone ready to fall. A sandy cliff with wave pounding action present will appear as a large sand cliff with deep grooves carved laterally and slumped scales of sand mounding on the bottom edge of the cliff.Wave pounding can be a seasonal event or even a daily event depending on the beach.Specific beaches around the world have seasonal changes in the beach angle due to long shore sand drift patterns. These phenomena will affect the strength that a wave will impact the cliff face.The rise and fall of tides also can mean the difference between a wave spilling onto the beach surface rather than into the cliff face.Wave pounding will affect most jetties and man made outcrops as well. The title of the wave will be different due to the depth of the water at the specific location. The waves do possess the power to damage or move stone on jetties. The steep edges of the jetties allow the waves to crash onto the rock.|$|R
