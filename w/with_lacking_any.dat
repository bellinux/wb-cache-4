Cross-adaptation MAEs were generated between stereoscopic and non-stereoscopic random dot stimuli {{moving in the}} one X/Y plane.

5000|$|Although {{nearly any}} work can {{potentially}} have skill and intelligence applied to it, many jobs that mostly comprise manual labour—such as {{fruit and vegetable}} picking, manual materials handling (for example, shelf stocking), manual digging, or manual assembly of parts—often may be done successfully (if not masterfully) by unskilled or semiskilled workers. Thus there is a partial but significant correlation between manual labour and unskilled or semiskilled workers. Based on economic and social conflict of interest, people may often distort that partial correlation into an exaggeration that equates manual labour <b>with</b> <b>lack</b> of skill; <b>with</b> <b>lack</b> of <b>any</b> potential to apply skill (to a task) or to develop skill (in a worker); and with low social class.
