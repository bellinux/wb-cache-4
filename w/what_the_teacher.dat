5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what the learners do in the classroom than with <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Gittings {{was born}} to Elizabeth (née Brooks) Gittings and John Sterett Gittings in Vienna, Austria, where her father was serving as a U.S. diplomat. Barbara and her {{siblings}} attended Catholic schools in Montreal. She was so immersed in Catholicism {{at one point in}} her childhood that she considered becoming a nun. Her family returned to the United States at the outbreak of World War II and settled in Wilmington, Delaware. Although aware of her attraction to other girls, Gittings said she first heard the word [...] "homosexual" [...] when she was rejected for membership in the National Honor Society in high school. Despite being an excellent student, a teacher who had reservations about her character took her aside and told her that the rejection was based on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> believed were [...] "homosexual inclinations".|$|E

I refer to the rights of the Committee, or the Trustees, or Patrons, in the control of the school. The right to such control, when claimed at all, is usually claimed in reference to the teacher's new plans, which renders it proper to allude to the subject here; and it ought not to be omitted, for a great many cases occur, in which teachers have difficulties with the trustees or committee of their school. Sometimes these difficulties have amounted to an open rupture; at other times, only to a slight and temporary misunderstanding, arising from <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> calls an unwise and unwarrantable interference {{on the part of the}} committee, or the trustees, in the arrangements of the school. Difficulties of some sort very often arise. In fact, a right understanding of this subject, is, in most cases, absolutely essential to the harmony and co-operation of the teacher, and the representatives of his patrons.|$|E

50|$|Some other {{approaches}} for classroom accommodations include pairing deaf or {{hard of hearing}} students with hearing students. This allows the deaf or hard of hearing student to ask the hearing student questions about concepts {{that they have not}} understood. The use of CART (Communication Access Real Time) systems, where an individual types a captioning of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is saying, is also beneficial. The student views this captioning on their computer. Automated captioning systems are also becoming a popular option. In an automated system, software, instead of a person, is used to generate the captioning. Unlike CART systems, automated systems generally do not require an Internet connection and thus they can be used anywhere and anytime. Another advantage of automated systems over CART is that they are much lower in cost. However, automated systems are generally designed to only transcribe <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is saying and to not transcribe what other students say. An automated system works best for situations where just the teacher is speaking, whereas a CART system will be preferred for situations where {{there is a lot of}} classroom discussion.|$|E

How do <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> work with <b>the</b> unit planning in preschool? How is the time being used when it comes to unit planning? <b>What</b> do <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> prioritize/what do <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> have time for and what do they not have time for?To be able to answer these questions we used curriculum theory, we interviewed six teachers from two preschools,one from each unit, and we also did two observations of unit planning, one each from the two preschools. The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> think <b>the</b> purpose is to see the children's learning and interests, how they can challenge the children and to get an approval from the director regarding the quality of <b>the</b> preschool. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> do not have the same amount of time to plan, <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> plan with <b>the</b> children’s interests in mind, they reflect on what they have done earlier and they plan what material they are going to use with the children, they discuss and plan for parent/teacher meetings and preschool introductions. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> think it is important to work with the curriculum but do not have it with them during unit planning. We could see they are aware of the curriculum goals and that not having enough time and factors like not having certain information for the planning of a preschool introduction, not being prepared, drifting away from what they need to talk about and not being able pedagogical documentation when and where they want affects the planning.
