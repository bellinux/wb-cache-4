5|$|The {{use of a}} truce term {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by a gesture, such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs. In the US a T-shape made <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> (representing time-out) has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek's death.|$|E
5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him {{across the back of}} the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E

5|$|Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig {{departed}} their {{landing place}} at Riccall {{with most of}} their forces, but left {{a third of their}} forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of berserkergang, having worn no body armour and fought aggressively <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> around his sword.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, {{the failure}} of the French expeditionary force was the source of great frustration: Wolfe Tone, who was aboard Indomptable {{throughout}} the voyage, reported that he felt that he could have touched either side of the bay <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands.</b> Postponing the uprising, Tone continued to rally support in Europe, raising a fleet in the Netherlands for an attempted invasion that ended in destruction at the Battle of Camperdown. In May 1798, a British crackdown arrested the leaders of the United Irishmen in Ireland and provoked the Irish Rebellion. By the time the French had managed to gather a small force and reach Ireland in August, the rebellion was almost over and the inadequate French army, led by Jean Humbert, surrendered in September at the Battle of Ballinamuck. A subsequent invasion attempt the following month also ended in failure, when the invasion squadron was intercepted and defeated at the Battle of Tory Island. Wolfe Tone was captured at the action off Tory Island and committed suicide in prison. His death, combined with military defeat and reprisals against the Irish rebels, ended both the Society of United Irishmen and French invasion plans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands.</b> At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E

5|$|On 16 October 2010, Diarra was {{involved}} in a controversial dispute, which resulted in the player being banned from playing league football for six matches. After receiving a yellow card booking from referee Wilfriend Bien in the team's 1–0 win over Auxerre, Diarra responded by pushing the referee <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands.</b> He was immediately shown a red card and dismissed from the match. After walking off the field, Diarra turned back, walked over to Bien and apologized for the confrontation. After the match, Diarra apologized again for the incident. He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple mistake that he immediately regretted as soon as he realized what he did. Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, his suspension was upgraded to six matches. Diarra returned to the team on 27 November playing only the first half in the team's 1–1 draw with Lille.|$|E
5|$|At first, Harvey {{struggled}} in the English conditions, failing to pass 25 {{in his first}} six innings. His most notable contribution {{in the early stages}} of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5/20 in pursuit of 60. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed it <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out. It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{made his}} debut on English {{soil in the}} second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 5, he came in at 3/316 and made 12, {{struggling}} against the local spinners, as Australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings. Harvey {{played a key role}} in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Harvey took two catches in the home side's first innings of 71. He made seven in the first innings as Australia replied with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 4/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat at No. 6, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett—Bradman rested himself for the match—top-edged a pull shot and was caught to leave Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed it <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he took several steps down the pitch to the bowling of Frank Smailes and missed, but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs by lifting Smailes for a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out.|$|E

5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious. When he gained consciousness the following day, {{he found himself in}} a hospital <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> amputated. The injured, mainly hawkers, were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten. Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident. Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road, Ambad, Ravivar Peth, and Gangapur areas. Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani. In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of the}} state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations.|$|E
