25|$|It {{was only}} after the multi-millionaire's death that Dr. <b>Washington</b> <b>said</b> he felt {{compelled}} to reveal publicly some {{of the extent of}} Henry Rogers' contributions for his causes. The funds, he said, were at that very time paying for the operation of at least 65 small country schools for the education and betterment of African Americans in Virginia and other portions of the South, all unknown to the recipients. Dr. Washington also disclosed that, known only to a few trustees, Henry Rogers had also generously provided support to institutions of higher education such as the schools which are now Hampton University and Tuskegee University.|$|E

500|$|In December 2009, <b>Washington</b> <b>said</b> Kinsler would bat {{second in}} 2010. [...] "I think Kinsler {{performs}} better when he's {{in the mix}} hitting {{at the top of}} the lineup in the first inning", <b>Washington</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "When he has to wait to hit, I think it takes a lot away from him." [...] But by early March, it was reported that he would bat fifth. <b>Washington</b> <b>said,</b> however, that that would not keep Kinsler from running: [...] "I will not slow him down. He is a threat. I will not take away that threat. I'm not stopping Kins." [...] On days when Julio Borbon was not batting leadoff, Kinsler was to move up to the top of the lineup. In the end, Kinsler started 60 games batting 3rd, 20 games batting 5th, 16 games batting 6th, and 6 games leading off.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} Major League start, on April 13, he allowed three runs in six innings {{and did not}} receive a decision.

500|$|The phrase [...] "entangling alliances," [...] {{which forms}} {{the basis of the}} Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances, has been misattributed in the popular press to Washington rather than Jefferson.

500|$|Kinsler {{was delighted}} when Rangers manager Ron Washington {{ultimately}} committed to Kinsler being the team's leadoff hitter in 2008. [...] "I didn't {{think he was}} the prototype leadoff hitter, but the guy proved me wrong", <b>Washington</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "He'll take a walk, or get one run for us with one swing of the bat. He can bunt, he can run, and he can hit {{the ball to the}} other side." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 25, Feldman outpitched Kansas City All-Star and AL ERA leader Zack Greinke {{with eight}} innings of four-hit, shutout ball, leading the Rangers to a 2–0 victory. [...] "Feldman matched the best pitcher in baseball", <b>Washington</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I’m {{so happy for}} him. Two {{pitchers}} went at it pretty good, and our's won the battle." [...] The eight innings were Feldman's major-league high, as he mixed in a changeup, curveball, and slider with his fastball.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} and public outcry after the withdrawal was significant. The Congress was appalled, and criticized both Schuyler and St. Clair for the loss.

In his time living in Florida, Clinkscales had a growth spurt and stood nearly at 6ft (1.83 m), boosting his performance on the court. Commenting on Clinkscales' decision to move to Florida, Clarence <b>Washington</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Going down there {{was the best thing}} that ever happened to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler was {{mentioned}} as an MVP candidate before his injury by writers at ESPN, the Dallas News, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post. He could have conceivably rivaled Pedroia for MVP, {{if not for}} the sports hernia that cut his 2008 campaign short a month and a half. [...] "I think he just missed having an MVP year", manager Ron <b>Washington</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "If luck [...] on our side and he [...] healthy, he would have run away with it." [...] In the end, he received a single 10th-place vote from Jeff Wilson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.|$|E
500|$|Washington {{was aware}} that some feared he aspired to be an [...] "American Cromwell". [...] In his reply, dated the same day he gave Nicola a decidedly clear answer, <b>Washington</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No {{incident}} {{in the course of}} the war in me triggers painful feelings as your message, that such ideas are circulating in the army, as you expressed it". [...] Washington mentioned that he knew not what part of his conduct could have given rise to such a petition, which he thought a [...] "calamity" [...] facing the United States. [...] David Humphreys and Jonathan Trumbull, two of Washington's aides, certified in a rare precautionary measure that proved the document to be genuine.|$|E

500|$|Davis slumped {{a bit in}} 2009 spring {{training}} but still began 2009 as the Rangers' first baseman. Rangers' manager Ron <b>Washington</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm not worried about Chris. Chris works hard. He had a little spell where {{he was trying to}} get himself together. He's going to have bad times, but what he did tonight is what he's capable of and he'll do that enough to make him love you." [...] On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 21 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 32 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 73 victory over the New York Yankees. He had four hits on June 25, the fourth a 12th-inning two-run home run against Esmerling Vásquez in a 98 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
500|$|Davis was {{recalled}} on August 25 after Andruw Jones {{went on the}} DL and Blalock struggled. On September 8, in {{the second}} game of a doubleheader, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home run against José Veras in a 105 victory over the Cleveland Indians. When Davis returned to the majors, his numbers improved dramatically, as he hit [...]318 in September and October, with five home runs and 21 RBIs in the two-month span. In 113 games (391 at bats), Davis batted [...]238 with 93 hits, 15 doubles, 21 home runs, and 59 RBI. However, he ranked seventh in the AL with 150 strikeouts. He did do well defensively; <b>Washington</b> <b>said,</b> when Blalock replaced him at first following his demotion, [...] "We can't expect Hank Blalock to be Chris Davis , but Hank is a professional. I think he can play first base." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{originally}} designed, Fort Corcoran's planned 12-gun complement {{would have}} been manned by 180 artillerymen, and the fort's 576yards of perimeter {{would have been}} guarded by 620 soldiers, for a total garrison of 800 men. The initial garrison was the 13th New York Volunteer Infantry, and the fort's 12 guns were manned by Company K of the 2nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. However, the demands of war meant that the 2nd Wisconsin Regiment was needed for the Peninsula Campaign and left Fort Corcoran in late 1861. Throughout the war, Fort Corcoran's rear location and proximity to the supply depots of Washington meant that {{a steady stream of}} Union regiments rotated through the fort and the military camps nearby for much of the war. In August 1861 alone, regiments from Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Michigan, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania served in or near the fort. So many troops were stationed in and near the fort, in fact, that in a report on March 31, 1863, General Barnard, chief engineer of the defenses of <b>Washington,</b> <b>said</b> Fort Corcoran was among a small number of sites that had [...] "more enlisted men than required as artillery garrisons." ...|$|E

500|$|The next day, July 13, Howe {{attempted}} to open {{negotiations with the}} Americans. He {{sent a letter to}} Washington delivered by Lieutenant Philip Brown, who arrived under a flag of truce. The letter was addressed [...] "George Washington, Esq." [...] Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington's orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no. Reed told Brown that {{there was no one in}} the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address [...] "George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.", but it was again declined. The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but <b>Washington</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Those who have committed no fault want no pardon." [...] Patterson departed soon after. Washington's performance during the meeting was praised in parts of the colonies.|$|E
500|$|After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington {{issued a}} {{statement}} apologizing for repeating the word on the Golden Globes carpet. On January 30, 2007, a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled {{to return to the}} Grey's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday {{for the first time since}} entering [...] "executive counseling" [...] after making the comments at the Golden Globes. However, on June 7, 2007, ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington's contract, and that he would be dropped from the show. [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore," [...] <b>Washington</b> <b>said</b> in a statement released by his publicist, borrowing the famous line from Network. In another report, Washington stated he was planning to [...] "spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, work on an independent film and avoid worrying about the show." [...] In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that [...] "they fired the wrong guy", referring to Knight, and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy. Washington, in late June 2007, began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series. On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who, he felt, was treating him like a [...] "B-word," [...] a [...] "P-word," [...] and the [...] "F-word," [...] which <b>Washington</b> <b>said</b> conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back." [...] Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past. He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show, he would not hesitate to say [...] "yes". Washington's image was used in advertisements for the May 9, 2008 episode [...] "The Becoming". After this aired, Washington's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an unlawful use of his client's image. His publicist, Howard Bragman, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "they have the rights of the character to advance the story, but not the image" [...] and stated he expected this to result in a [...] "financial settlement", but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, <b>Washington</b> <b>said</b> that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E
