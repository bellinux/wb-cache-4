[...] The American Flint Glass Workers Union was naturally opposed to mechanization or concessions, and it was strong enough that a single glass works could not oppose it.

[...] Glass was not produced at Factory H, although inventory was still being sold. [...] In January 1894 U.S. Glass proposed that if the workers at its Wheeling plants would accept the terms of the labor agreements used in its Pittsburg plants, work would start immediately. [...] If the conditions were not accepted, then Wheeling's two glass works (including Factory H) would be torn down. [...] The union rejected the proposed terms. [...] Members of the union remained on strike until 1897. [...] U.S. Glass survived by producing glass at its two large (and recently built) highly mechanized plants.|$|E

50|$|In 1818 <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> {{were built}} on the north bank of the River Thames in St Ebbes, to supply the city with gas.

50|$|The {{engineers}} {{were transferred to}} Salonika and Volos and, when the Germans reached the city, successfully demolished installations of use to the enemy, including oil refineries, engineering <b>works,</b> <b>gas</b> works, port facilities and fortifications at Volos. Outside Athens, a new airfield and its equipment was destroyed. Some members of the RE detachment were lost, as casualties or captured, before the bulk were evacuated to Crete, where others were captured or killed when the Germans invaded. One captured officer (Dennis Alabaster) escaped while being transported through Yugoslavia and joined the Chetniks; he was subsequently killed there.|$|E
5000|$|The Polish-Ukrainian {{fight for}} Lviv is {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "the last civilized conflict" [...] by Polish historians. Because both sides were too weak to create regular front lines and lacked heavy weapons, the civilian casualties were low and did not exceed 400. Also, both sides tried to avoid destroying the city's facilities and the most important buildings were declared de-militarized zones. Among them were the hospitals, the water <b>works,</b> <b>gas</b> plant and the energy plant. Local ceasefire agreements were signed on a daily basis and there were even numerous situations where both Polish and Ukrainian soldiers played football or partied during cease fires. In his memoirs, Polish Lieutenant (later Colonel) Bolesław Szwarcenberg-Czerny noted that during one of the ceasefires Lieutenant Levsky, the Ukrainian commander of an outpost fighting with his unit, got so drunk with the Poles that he overslept and woke up late after the latest ceasefire had ended. Immediately another ceasefire was signed to allow the Ukrainian officer to return to his unit.|$|E
