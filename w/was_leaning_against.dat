500|$|Taoist myths {{state that}} Laozi was {{conceived}} {{when his mother}} gazed upon a falling star. He supposedly remained in her womb for 62 years before being born while his mother <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> a plum tree. (The Chinese surname Li shares its character with [...] "plum".) Laozi {{was said to have}} emerged as a grown man with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life. Other myths state that he was reborn 13 times after his first life during the days of Fuxi. In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived nine hundred and ninety years and spent his life traveling to reveal the Tao.|$|E
500|$|During the engagement, Monitors turret {{began to}} malfunction, making it {{extremely}} difficult to turn and stop at a given position, so the crew simply let the turret continuously turn and fired their guns [...] "on the fly" [...] as they bore on Virginia. Several times, Monitor received direct hits on the turret, causing some bolts to violently shear off and ricochet around inside. The deafening sound of the impact stunned some of the crew, causing nose and ear bleeding. However, neither vessel was able to sink or seriously damage the other. At one point, Virginia attempted to ram, but only struck Monitor a glancing blow and did no damage. The collision did, however, aggravate the damage to Virginias bow from when she had previously rammed Cumberland. Monitor was also unable to do significant damage to Virginia, possibly {{due to the fact}} that her guns were firing with reduced charges, on advice from Commander John Dahlgren, the gun's designer, who lacked the [...] "preliminary information" [...] needed to determine what amount of charge was needed to [...] "pierce, dislocate or dislodge iron plates" [...] of various thicknesses and configurations. During the battle Stodder was stationed at the wheel that controlled the turning of the turret but at one point when he <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> its side the turret received a direct hit directly opposite to him which knocked him clear across the inside, rendering him unconscious, at where he was taken below to recover and relieved by Stimers.|$|E
500|$|Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two {{hit it off}} and {{discussed}} putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979. According to Iyall, the name Romeo Void referred to [...] "a lack of romance" [...] and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline [...] "Why single women can't get laid in San Francisco." [...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] I was proud of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond." ...|$|E

2500|$|EastEnders {{scriptwriter}} Tony Jordan {{revealed that}} he created the character with Turner in mind: [...] "I first met Lacey {{when she came to}} a casting workshop for the Miller family ... She <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> a wall and looked just like Kat Slater, played by Wallace. I thought she would be perfect for the Slater family so I wrote in Stacey’s character especially for Lacey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cooper's dream {{at the end}} of {{the third}} episode, which became a driving plot point in the series's first season and {{ultimately}} held the key to the identity of Laura's murderer, was never scripted. The idea came to Lynch one afternoon after touching the side of a hot car left out in the sun: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> a car—the front of me <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> this very warm car. My hands were on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt into my mind. 'Little Mike' was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of the night I thought only about The Red Room." [...] The footage was originally shot along with the pilot, to be used as the conclusion were it to be released as a feature film. When the series was picked up, Lynch decided to incorporate some of the footage; in the third episode, Cooper, narrating the dream, outlines the shot footage which Lynch did not incorporate, such as Mike shooting Bob and the fact that he is 25 years older when he meets Laura Palmer's spirit.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the height}} of the {{fighting}} on May 3, Hooker suffered an injury when at 9:15a.m. a Confederate cannonball hit a wooden pillar he <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> at his headquarters. He later wrote that half of the pillar [...] "violently ... in an erect position from my head to my feet." [...] He likely received a concussion, which was sufficiently severe to render him unconscious for over an hour. Although clearly incapacitated after he arose, Hooker refused to turn over command temporarily to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch, and, with Hooker's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, and Sedgwick out of communication (again due to the failure of the telegraph lines), there was no one at headquarters with sufficient rank or stature to convince Hooker otherwise. This failure may have affected Union performance over the next day and may have directly contributed to Hooker's seeming lack of nerve and timid performance {{throughout the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Chancellorsville {{has been}} called [...] "Lee's perfect battle" [...] because {{of his ability to}} vanquish a much larger foe through audacious tactics. Part of Hooker's failure can be {{attributed}} to an encounter with a cannonball; while standing on the porch of his headquarters, the missile struck a wooden column the general <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against,</b> initially knocking him senseless, and then putting him out of action {{for the rest of the}} day with a concussion. Despite his incapacitation, he refused entreaties to turn over temporary command of the army to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch. Several of his subordinate generals, including Couch and Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, openly questioned Hooker's command decisions. Couch was so disgusted that he refused to ever serve under Hooker again. Political winds blew strongly in the following weeks as generals maneuvered to overthrow Hooker or to position themselves if Lincoln decided on his own to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Parameswara (also {{known as}} [...] "Iskandar Shah" [...] in some accounts) fled north to Muar, Ujong Tanah and Biawak Busuk before {{reaching}} a fishing village {{at the mouth}} of Bertam river (modern-day Malacca River). Legend has it that the king saw a mouse deer outwit his hunting dog into the water when he was resting under the Malacca tree. He thought this bode well, remarking, 'this place is excellent, even the mouse deer is formidable; it is best that we establish a kingdom here'. Tradition holds that he named the settlement after the tree he <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> while witnessing the portentous event. Today, the mouse deer is part of modern Malacca's coat of arms. The name [...] "Malacca" [...] itself was derived from the fruit-bearing Melaka tree (...) scientifically termed as Phyllanthus emblica. Another account of the naming origin of Malacca elaborates that during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (r. 1424–1444), the Arab merchants called the kingdom 'Malakat' (Arabic for 'congregation of merchants') because it was home to many trading communities.|$|E
