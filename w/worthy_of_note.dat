At a height of 600 feet (183 m) it was the tallest building in the UK until the topping-out of Canary Wharf Tower 10 years later; its footprint loosely approximating the bank's logo when viewed from the air, although the architect claimed the similarity was coincidence. Also <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> is National Westminster House (since renamed as 103 Colmore Row) in Birmingham: the building was sold to British Land in 2007 and demolished in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany became {{constitutional}} {{and dropped the}} Austrian flag, with Austria–Lorraine great coat of arms, in favour of the defaced Italian tricolour with simplified arms. It is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note,</b> however, that the arms bear the red-white-red flag of Austria, the opponent of Italian unification. In 1859, the Granducato officially ceased to exist, being joined to the Duchies of Modena and Parma to form the United Provinces of Central Italy, which used the undefaced tricolour until it was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia the following year.|$|E

25|$|Also <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> is that Ford {{has also}} been a rock & roll {{keyboards}} player. He played with guitarist Dave Edmunds and has occasionally performed in recent years. Ford has been active in the diplomatic and political world and is a trained marksman. He can pilot aeroplanes, ski and scuba-dive. He is also an award-winning photographer.|$|E
25|$|It is also <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> {{that the}} Dorothy {{of the books}} is only {{a little girl who}} is no older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with {{ultimate}} despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old Judy Garland) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was overshadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum is known for his strong and independent female characters.|$|E

50|$|<b>Worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>noting</b> {{that the}} rituals {{are done in}} various ways now due to the era of Christianity.The most typical way of doing the rituals is that the {{incoming}} Onyishi prays before the corpse with kolanuts and cock (a fowl which he must slaughter there) declaring that if he has hand in killing the demised Onyishi he is taking over from,let him die before one month or so.|$|R
25|$|Labor Lawyer also {{represents}} an important primary {{source for the}} history of the Socialist Party in the years following the death of Eugene Victor Debs. It is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> that many of the figures he denounces as dangerous pro-Communists in his book, such as Reinhold Niebuhr and Andrew Biemiller, would later become pillars of anti-Communist liberals of the postwar years. While Waldman himself was mostly apolitical after the war, this perspective clearly informed younger Old Guard supporters such as Morrie Ryskind and Ralph de Toledano who moved to the right from the anti-Communist left.|$|E
25|$|Daubón {{offered his}} {{services}} {{and the use of}} his vessel and men to the Spanish Colonial Governor of Puerto Rico and together with the French Consul on the island, M. Paris, gathered a group of French immigrants in Puerto Rico and sent these troops to successfully protect the entrance of San Juan at Fort San Gerónimo. Among the French surnames of those who fought on the Island were: Bernard, Hirigoyan, Chateau, Roussell, Larrac and Mallet. It is also <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> to mention that the British attempted to land in San Juan harbor with a force of 400 French prisoners, who were forced to fight against their will the other French troops defending Puerto Rico.|$|E

25|$|The {{text of the}} Torah {{argues that}} the name of Judah, meaning to thank or admit, refers to Leah's intent to thank Hashem, on account of having {{achieved}} four children, and derived from odeh, meaning I will give thanks. In classical rabbinical literature, the name is interpreted as a combination of Yahweh and a dalet (the letter d); in Gematria, the dalet has the numerical value 4, which these rabbinical sources argue refers to Judah being Jacob's fourth son. Since Leah was matriarch, Jewish scholars think the text's authors believed the tribe {{was part of the}} original Israelite confederation; however, it is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> that the tribe of Judah was not purely Israelite, but contained a large admixture of non-Israelites, with a number of Kenizzite groups, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites, merging into the tribe at various points.|$|E
25|$|Many {{difficulties}} {{occurred in}} driving the piles which considerably retarded {{the progress of}} the work, and, among others, the peculiar effect of ebb and flow during this operation is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note.</b> At flood-tide the sand became so hard as almost totally to resist the utmost efforts of driving, while at ebb the sand was quite loose, and allowed of doing so with facility. It was therefore found necessary to abandon the driving on many occasions during high water. The difference between high and low water is 11 feet 6 inches. Another difficulty arose from the quicksands beneath the foundations. Although the piles were driven to the rock bottom, the water forced its way up, baffling the attempts to fill in between them; this, however, was remedied by using a concrete made of broken stone and Roman cement, which was continually thrown in until the bottom was found to be secure.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Boyns {{had plenty}} of first-team {{opportunities}} from late May to early July, {{but on the whole}} did not make the most of them. His highest score during this period was 41*, and though he claimed a List A career-best of 4–34 in the John Player League against Leicestershire he was soon back in the seconds yet again. Here, as they had on several previous occasions, the runs flowed, with scores of 105*, 87 and 78* leading to his recall. He made 71 against the New Zealanders {{in the second half of}} August, but little else was <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note.</b> By 1979 Boyns' days as a Worcestershire cricketer were numbered, and indeed he made only one first-class appearance that summer, against the Sri Lankans in mid-July, although he did play six times in one-day matches. His last first-class wicket was that of Sri Lankan Roy Dias, while his last List A scalp was Sussex's Tony Pigott just a few days later.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, Starewicz {{moved to}} Moscow and began {{work with the}} film company of Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. There he made two dozen films, most of them puppet {{animations}} using dead animals. Of these, The Beautiful Leukanida (premiere - 1912), first puppet film with a plot inspired {{in the story of}} Agamenon and Menelas, earned international acclaim (one British reviewer was tricked into thinking the stars were live trained insects), while The Grasshopper and the Ant (1911) got Starewicz decorated by the czar. But the best-known film of this period, was Mest' kinematograficheskogo operatora (Revenge of the Kinematograph Cameraman, aka The Cameraman's Revenge) (1912), a cynical work about infidelity and jealousy among the insects. Some of the films made for Khanzhonkov feature live-action/animation interaction. In some cases, the live action consisted of footage of Starewicz's daughter Irina. Particularly <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> is Starevich's 41-minute 1913 film The Night Before Christmas, an adaptation of the Nikolai Gogol story of the same name. The 1913 film Terrible Vengeance won the Gold Medal at an international festival in Milan in 1914, being just one of five films which won awards among 1005 contestants.|$|E
25|$|Abruzzo's {{industrial}} sector expanded rapidly, especially in mechanical engineering, transportation equipment and telecommunications. The structure of {{production in the}} region reflects {{the transformation of the}} economy from agriculture to industry and services. Although industry has developed strongly, it retains weak points due to the existence of only a few large businesses alongside a huge fabric of small and medium-sized businesses. Both pure and applied research are carried out in the region, where there are major institutes and factories involved in research in the fields of pharmaceutics, biomedicine, electronics, aerospace and nuclear physics. The industrial infrastructure is spread throughout the region in industrial zones which have already been mentioned, the most important of which are Val Pescara, Val Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino. A further activity <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> is seaside and mountain tourism, which is of considerable importance to the economy of the region. Agriculture, involving small holdings, has succeeded in modernising and offering high-quality products. The mostly small, agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, sugar beet, potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Traditional products are saffron and liquorice. Most famous in the world is Abruzzo's wine Montepulciano d'Abruzzo; in the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as being {{one of the most widely}} exported DOC classed wine in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Hardy himself stated {{during his}} meeting with Griffith and the group of {{disguised}} journalists {{that he was an}} Englishman who had become disillusioned with the British government and was willing to betray it for the Republican cause as revenge for his life of incarceration. The historian T. Ryle Dwyer argues that these were in fact his true aims and his hatred of the English was not believed by Griffith and Collins, who sent him away, believing him to be a threat to the Republican cause. Hardy's true intentions remain ambiguous and claims that he sided with either party are undermined by his deceptive history. Although not conclusive, it is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> that there is no record of Hardy supporting any Irish Republican cause before 1920 and he had no family history of such activities. An interesting piece of evidence {{is to be found in}} the Irish newspaper reports of the time. It was generally stated among journalists congregated to listen to Hardy that Captain Thomson was a fictitious name and that the true identity of Hardy's commanding officer had been withheld to deceive Irish republicans. It is now known that Sir Basil Thomson was indeed the Director of Intelligence at the Home Office, a detail which—in addition to Colonel Ormonde Winter's official after action remarks on the Hardy case—adds considerable weight to the supposition that Hardy genuinely attempted to betray the British, as it would imply that he freely solicited the information to Griffith.|$|E

500|$|The cast of {{the film}} were praised, with Dowling {{considering}} The Turn of the Screw [...] "a slick production with strong performances", and Cooper saying that the film features [...] "a great supporting cast". Critics particularly commended the performances of Dockery and Johnston. Dowling also picked out the performances of Lindsay and Sayer as <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note,</b> while Whitelaw praised MacLiam, who was able [...] "to personify pure evil with scarcely a line of dialogue".

While he did not feel that all of the tracks were of consistent quality, he said that none of them were [...] "bad" [...] and that the more [...] "atmospheric" [...] tracks stood out as particularly noteworthy. Reviewers from Square Enix Music Online had similar praises and criticisms, calling it [...] "not the most diverse or consistent of Front Mission scores" [...] but still [...] "highly worthy"; they also noted the atmospheric tracks as <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>note.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{building}} {{work on the}} Autobahn A 61 (Ludwigshafen-Koblenz), an Iron Age burying {{ground was}} unearthed, and in 1971 a dig was conducted there. The burying ground itself {{is a group of}} 13 individual barrows arranged along a trail leading across the Hunsrück and in places the heights along the Rhine, which was expanded in Roman times. For some of the cremations, the barrow was raised right over the charred funeral pyre. Among the grave goods that were <b>worthiest</b> <b>of</b> <b>note</b> were an open-worked belthook and an iron belt ring. The ceramics that were preserved, among them a thrown clay bottle, date the burying ground to the later Hunsrück-Eifel Culture (eras IIA to IIB), or the second fourth of the 5th century BC to the earlier half of the 3rd century BC.|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, Lutheran scholar Francis Pieper {{wrote in}} Christian Dogmatics {{emphasizing}} the antiquity {{and significance of}} the reference.

50|$|All {{these four}} subgenres of the qaṣīd are {{characterized}} by actual events and relevance; in other words, relating {{to the events of}} everyday life, and to the reality of life that could be felt in Yemen. As such, the language employed adapts itself to this character, and is written in the spoken (colloquial) Yemenite dialect. However, due to this debased and low characteristic, the qaṣīd was completely detached from the national-religious experience, and was never performed in the aforementioned social gatherings, except toward the end, after the distinguished guests, including rabbis, had abandoned the party. This is absolutely non-existent with respect to the “classical” genres of nashīd, shīrah and hallel that were performed with vocal music in para-liturgical social gatherings. It is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>noting</b> that copyists were usually not willing to include the qiṣwad in their dīwāns.|$|R
