50|$|The icons in File Explorer {{have been}} redesigned. The icons are flatter and simpler in design. The <b>window</b> <b>border</b> padding is thinner than {{previous}} versions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} block Fourier vectors [...] have sharp transitions at the <b>window</b> <b>border,</b> {{and thus}} are not well localized in frequency. As in the continuous case, the decomposition of smooth signals [...] may produce large-amplitude, high-frequency coefficients because of border effects.|$|E
50|$|This version {{included}} many bug fixes {{as well as}} updates to the visual styles, various icons, the logon screen, {{and other parts of}} the UI. The most notable addition was the WindowBlinds glass theme, which allowed for actual <b>window</b> <b>border</b> transparencies like Vista's Aero interface.|$|E

50|$|The Rocca Malaspina ("Malaspina Castle"), {{resembling}} to a house-tower. The façade {{has three}} staggered portails and concave <b>windows</b> <b>bordered</b> by a cylindric cordon.|$|R
5000|$|WindowBlinds (now re-branded as one word) quickly {{made its}} way to a 1.0 release, driven by the {{requests}} of users to add [...] "freeform skinning" [...] (customizable <b>window</b> <b>border</b> shapes), sounds, and animation. Scrollbars, the task bar, the start button, menu items, the menu itself, and other GUI elements were added later.|$|E
50|$|UDE's user {{interface}} philosophy {{is quite different}} from that of other desktop environments. It is designed to be used very efficiently after a short learning phase. There is no taskbar or desktop panel or equivalent. Windows lack a title bar and as such there are no buttons to close, resize, iconify or maximize windows on the window borders. These buttons are replaced by the so-called hex menu or honeycomb that appears when the user clicks on the <b>window</b> <b>border</b> (See picture).|$|E
50|$|A <b>window</b> <b>border</b> is {{a window}} {{decoration}} component provided by some window managers, that appears around the active window. Some window managers may also display a border around background windows. Typically window borders {{can be used to}} provide window motion enabling the window to be moved or resized by using a drag action. Some window managers provide useless borders which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no window motion facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be resized by using a drag action on the border.|$|E
50|$|Appearance {{allows users}} to {{customize}} the Windows Classic theme by changing the colour of various objects, such as scrollbars, active and inactive windows, menu bar, message box, <b>window</b> <b>borders,</b> <b>window</b> frame, selected items, font colours, 3D objects, {{and a few other}} things as well.|$|R
50|$|Linux {{operating}} systems may support themes {{depending on their}} window managers and desktop environments. IceWM uses themes to customize its taskbar, <b>window</b> <b>borders,</b> and time format. WindowMaker can store colors for icons, menus, and window-borders in a theme, but this is independent of the wallpaper settings. GNOME and KDE use two independent sets of themes: one to alter the appearance of user interface elements (such as buttons, scroll bars or list elements), and another theme to customize the appearance of windows (such as, <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> and title bars).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The blur {{effect of}} Windows Aero, which blurs the {{background}} when viewing through the <b>Window</b> <b>borders,</b> is enabled by the DWM compositing manager, using custom pixel shader programs.|$|R
50|$|The PlayStation Portable {{version of}} Princess Crown was {{announced}} at the 2004 Tokyo Game Show by representatives of Sony Computer Entertainment, with the first playable build of the game being exhibited the following year at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show. The port features the option to display in {{the game in the}} original 4:3 aspect ratio of the Saturn release with a custom <b>window</b> <b>border,</b> or to stretch the display to fit the handheld's widescreen aspect. It also includes new features such as a more legible font and a gallery mode with music and illustrations.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} palette {{made its}} debut with 8.5 - the application menu at {{the right side of}} the menu bar could be resized to show the active application's name, or 'torn off' into a palette of buttons. This palette could be customized many ways, by removing the window frame and changing the size and layout of the buttons. Apple provided no user interface to set these options, instead making them available via AppleScript and Apple Events and relying on third parties to provide a user interface for the task. By setting it to display horizontally and turning off the <b>window</b> <b>border,</b> the palette could be configured to look and function much like the Windows 95 task bar.|$|E
50|$|Aqua {{has also}} been {{embedded}} in Apple's applications for Microsoft Windows, such as iTunes, QuickTime and Safari (although not in Safari 4). iTunes for Windows has generally adopted the same developments as the concurrent macOS version, {{with the exception of}} the use of native Windows user interface controls and Windows-style title bar buttons at the upper right of the player window. The Windows version of Safari, in version 3, included a functional Aqua look and feel that was very similar to macOS. As of version 4, a more Windows-like theme was employed using the standard Windows user interface controls and <b>window</b> <b>border.</b> QuickTime for Windows uses the same theme as seen in older versions of QuickTime for macOS, with brushed-metal windows and Aqua buttons on top.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea was}} {{developed}} at the Stanford Research Institute (led by Douglas Engelbart). Their earliest systems supported multiple windows, {{but there was no}} obvious way to indicate boundaries between them (such as <b>window</b> <b>borders,</b> title bars, etc.).|$|R

50|$|Calmira LFN: Modified {{version that}} {{supports}} Long File Names, better icon shading, a 'My Documents' icon, and a dialog {{to change the}} wallpaper. The last version (released on December 19, 2006) also has custom <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> that mimic <b>Windows</b> 95 ones.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{abandoned}} local side platforms; the northbound one is visible through <b>windows,</b> <b>bordered</b> with wide, bright red frames. From {{the north end}} of the downtown platform's mezzanine, the adjacent side platform can be seen through a hole in the plywood.|$|R
50|$|Changing {{the desktop}} colors (<b>windows</b> <b>borders,</b> 3D object bevels, scrollbar, etc.) do work, {{but the problem}} with text display is hard to correct since all Windows' and its {{applications}} screens are affected, and even rebooting or rolling back to a previous system restore point may be difficult.|$|R
50|$|Calmira XP: Modified {{version that}} tries to mimic the Windows XP interface. Version 4.0 Beta also {{includes}} modifications from Calmira LFN, but has been released on March 6, 2006, meaning that some bugs fixed in Calmira LFN since then are still there, {{and that there are}} no custom <b>window</b> <b>borders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Windows 7 {{retains the}} Windows Aero {{graphical}} user interface and visual style introduced in the operating system's predecessor, Windows Vista, but many areas have seen enhancements. Unlike <b>Windows</b> Vista, <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> and the taskbar do not turn opaque when a window is maximized when Windows Aero is active; instead, they remain translucent.|$|R
50|$|Most Linux desktop environments use the key {{similar to}} how Windows uses it, for window {{management}} and application launching, rather than commands used by applications themselves. A popular non-Windows style use is to modify mouse drags {{so that they}} move or resize windows from inside them, rather than requiring clicking on the <b>window</b> <b>borders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Architect: Andre Arfidson Ceramic {{detailing}} {{gives this}} industrial façade charm {{and helped the}} architect win an award for its frontage in 1911 from the Town of Paris. The sandstone tiling by ceramist Alexandre Bigot covers this reinforced concrete duplex of twenty workshops with residences. The three-dimensional floral elements add geometric patterning to the piers and around the <b>window</b> <b>borders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Visual styles - WindowBlinds skins {{that changes}} the {{appearance}} of the <b>window</b> <b>borders,</b> the start-bar and various other UI elements - are used in combination with IconPackager, which changes {{the appearance of the}} window icons. A typical icon pack will include custom desktop icons, folder icons and file icons. SoundPackager is usually also used to change the system sounds.|$|R
50|$|The house sits on {{the corner}} of Main and Second Street, and has two {{identical}} façades facing each street. Each face has a central pedimented portico supported by four Tuscan columns. Each portico is flanked by tri-part windows consisting a nine-over-nine sash <b>window</b> <b>bordered</b> by narrow three-over-three sashes. The interior retains its Greek Revival woodwork and mantels.|$|R
5000|$|Third-party {{applications}} can be configured to {{work with}} visual styles. By default, the title bar and the <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> of <b>Windows</b> Forms-based applications are rendered using the user's preferred visual style, {{while the rest of}} the application's graphical user interface (GUI) is rendered in the Classic style. This is because these two different parts of the GUI are rendered using two different software libraries: the title bar and the <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> ("non-client area" [...] or [...] "user controls") use Windows USER, and the remaining controls ("client area" [...] or [...] "common controls") use version 5.8 of the Common Controls Library. Version 6.0 of the Common Controls Library contains both the user controls and the common controls, and developers may configure the application's user interface to be displayed in the user's currently-selected visual style by forcing it to be rendered using version 6.0 of the library.|$|R
50|$|The Bluecurve <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> and GTK+ (widget) theme {{have been}} {{replaced}} by those from Clearlooks (the first in Fedora Core 4, the second in FC5). However, the old Bluecurve themes (windowing and widget) are still installed by default and can be selected in the theme manager. The Bluecurve icon set remains installed in Fedora 7, but has been replaced as the default by Echo.|$|R
50|$|User {{interaction}} works {{entirely by}} using the different mouse buttons on <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> and the desktop background. Combinations of mouse clicks can trigger more complex actions such as moving a window from one workspace to another or loading multiple programs (or multiple instances of a single program) at a time. For that reason, efficient usage of UDE is only possible using a three-button mouse. As of today, UDE offers only very basic support for keyboard shortcuts.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of Ubuntu Touch is convergence, {{which means that the}} tablet has both a [...] "tablet mode" [...] and a [...] "desktop mode". In desktop mode, a keyboard and mouse can be connected and the tablet shows <b>windows</b> with <b>window</b> <b>borders.</b> Programs made for desktop Linux work in this mode. In tablet mode, it can connect to a screen through a HDMI port and then it becomes a touchpad. The tablet mode uses a touch UI designed for use with fingers on the screen.|$|R
5000|$|Weston {{relies on}} GEM to share {{application}} buffers between the compositor and applications. It contains a plugin system of [...] "shells" [...] for common desktop features like docks and panels. Clients {{are responsible for}} the drawing of their <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> and their decorations. For rendering, Weston can use OpenGL ES or the pixman library to do software rendering. The full OpenGL implementation is not used, because on most current systems, installing the full OpenGL libraries would also install GLX and other X Window System support libraries as dependencies.|$|R
30|$|The surface {{roughness}} and {{presence of the}} various irregular objects on the considered reflecting surfaces and inside them (bricks, <b>windows,</b> <b>borders,</b> manholes, advertisement boards on the walls, etc.) lead to separation the specular reflection ray {{to a number of}} additional rays with close delays and angles: a cluster. The intra-cluster parameters of the channel model were extracted from the indoor models [6, 7], obtained from the measurement data [23]. The intra-cluster structure is introduced in the Q-D model {{in the same way as}} R-rays: as Poisson-distributed in time, exponentially decaying Rayleigh components, dependent on the main ray.|$|R
5000|$|The McClurg Building is a {{historic}} skyscraper in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. The building was built in 1899 and designed by Chicago school architects Holabird & Roche. At nine stories tall and 80 ft by 150 ft at its base, the building {{is one of the}} smallest skyscrapers in Chicago. The building's Wabash Street facade has [...] of <b>windows</b> <b>bordered</b> by terra cotta piers and spandrels; the amount of window space was necessitated by the absence of windows {{on the sides of the}} building. The A.C. McClurg publishing company was the building's main occupant and gave the building its name.|$|R
5000|$|In Windows 8.x, Metro-style apps do not {{run in a}} window. Instead, {{they either}} occupy the entire screen or are snapped to one side, in which case they occupy the entire height of the screen but only part of its width. They have no title bar, system menu, <b>window</b> <b>borders</b> or control buttons. Command {{interfaces}} like scroll bars are usually hidden at first. Menus {{are located in the}} [...] "settings charm". Metro-style apps use the UI controls of Windows 8.x and typically follow Windows 8.x UI guidelines, such as horizontal scrolling and the inclusion of edge-UIs, like the app bar.|$|R
