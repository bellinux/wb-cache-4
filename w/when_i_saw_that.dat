Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E

Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, [...] "I don't know her, I never met her, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> pic, I thought, 'That's me!'

I was inclined to offer him a goodly sum if he would undertake {{to go to bed with}} it.

2500|$|AXS writer Terrance Pryor {{considers}} What to Do When You Are Dead {{a concept}} album [...] "based around the main character's suicide and his {{journey through the}} afterlife". Some observers have noted the character going through the Kübler-Ross 5-stage model of grief management. Jorgensen {{grew up in a}} [...] "very scientific environment," [...] which caused him to be influenced by British writer Craig Hamilton-Parker. The album's title comes from a Hamilton-Parker book. Jorgensen explained that since he was [...] "already writing an album in that way, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> book, I thought, 'It would be really cool to make a whole album out of this." [...] Jorgensen later remarked that placing himself in that perspective helped him [...] "face a lot of things I probably would've been too much of a wuss to face, if I didn't pretend I wasn't alive". The band were initially hesitant working on a concept album until they were persuaded by Jorgensen.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the king}} of the Franks [...] was on the hill with that band, they made a {{formidable}} charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back to my father [...] I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale. He took hold of his beard and advanced, crying out [...] "Give the lie to the Devil!" [...] The Muslims rallied, returned to the fight and climbed the hill. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the Franks withdrew, pursued by the Muslims, I shouted for joy, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] But the Franks rallied and charged again like the first time and drove the Muslims back to my father. He acted as he had done on the first occasion and the Muslims turned upon the Franks and drove them back to the hill. I again shouted, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] but my father rounded on me and said, [...] "Be quiet! We have not beaten them until that tent [...] falls." [...] As he was speaking to me, the tent fell. The sultan dismounted, prostrated himself in thanks to God Almighty and wept for joy.|$|E
2500|$|For nearly 30 years, Kiedis and Faith No More/Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton {{have been}} {{involved}} in an ongoing feud. Faith No More (then fronted by Chuck Mosley) and The Red Hot Chili Peppers prior to the feud had toured together in support of their 1987 funk metal albums The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Introduce Yourself. However things turned ugly between the two in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement Patton of imitating his style on stage and in their music video for their biggest hit [...] "Epic" [...] (from 1989's follow up to Introduce Yourself, The Real Thing). Kiedis stated “I watched [...] “Epic” video, and I see him jumping up and down, rapping, and it looked like I was looking in a mirror. I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?'". The feud between the two was reignited in 1999 when Mr. Bungle was scheduled to release their album California on June 8, 1999 but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back a week so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Mr. Bungle claimed that Kiedis had them removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe claiming that as the headlining act at the festivals, the Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E
