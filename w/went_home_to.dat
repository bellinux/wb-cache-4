5|$|The Trojans next <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> {{face the}} Arizona Wildcats, led by second–year head coach Mike Stoops and quarterback Richard Kovalcheck. Though the Trojans were a 38.5point {{favorite}} and took an early lead on a LenDale White rushing touchdown, the Wildcats answered after Kovalcheck threw his own touchdown {{and the game}} was tied {{at the end of}} the first quarter. Though both teams struggled in the second quarter, Leinart was able to complete a 22-yard touchdown to Dwayne Jarrett late in the half to take a 14–7 lead. In the third quarter, White rushed for two more touchdowns, however, Kovalcheck answered both times to keep the Wildcats within a touchdown going into the fourth quarter. Early in the fourth, Leinart threw his second touchdown to Jarrett and White rushed for a fourth touchdown to give the Trojans a 42–21 win. Both White and Bush rushed for over 100yards for the third straight game, which was a school record, and the win increased the Trojan winning streak to 27games.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard of}} Sweyn's defeat by Magnus, Harald {{met up with}} his fellow exile in Sweden (who was also his nephew), {{as well as with}} the Swedish king Anund Jacob, and the three joined forces against Magnus. Their first {{military}} exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast, in an effort to impress the natives by demonstrating that Magnus offered them no protection, and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn. Learning about their actions, Magnus knew that their next target would be Norway. Harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father's petty kingdom, and thereafter claim the rest of the country. In any case, the people were unwilling to turn against Magnus, and on hearing news of Harald's schemes, Magnus (abroad at the time) <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Norway with his entire army. Instead of going to war, Magnus's advisors recommended the young king not fight his uncle, and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which Harald would rule Norway (not Denmark) jointly with Magnus (although Magnus would have precedence). Notably, Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with Magnus, who at the time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds. During their short co-rule, Harald and Magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves, and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes.|$|E

His success led to his second major league managerial job when he replaced Harry Walker as skipper of the St. Louis Cardinals shortly after the 1955 season.|$|E
25|$|Potter's {{claims are}} questionable. The French {{were not in}} any {{position}} to receive Rogers, with a British governor sitting in Montreal.

After less than a year, he abandoned the practice to pursue his study of political science and history. Both parents expressed concern over a potentially premature decision.|$|E

At the time, Surrey was home to quite a few of the UK's smaller road and competition automobile manufacturers – including AC, Alta and HWM – and it was to the automobile industry that Maddock directed his attention.|$|E

He only took {{outright}} wins in lesser sports car racing events, {{such as at}} AVUS or the 500 km Nürburgring. The Abarths were hard to beat in their classes from 850cc to 1600cc, though. Being the only pro in a small team Hermann {{learned a lot about}} testing and developing, which helped him later. However, being dissatisfied with the preparation of his car for the 1965 Schauinsland practice, Hans <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> witness the birth of his son, Dino. At {{the end of the year}} he left Abarth for good to return to the manufacturer closer to his home.|$|E
25|$|After school, Osborne <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> {{his mother}} in London and briefly tried trade journalism. A job {{tutoring}} a touring company of junior actors {{introduced him to the}} theatre. He soon became involved as a stage manager and acting, joining Anthony Creighton's provincial touring company. Osborne tried his hand at writing plays, co-writing his first, The Devil Inside Him, with his mentor Stella Linden, who then directed it at the Theatre Royal in Huddersfield in 1950. Around this time he also married Pamela Lane. His second play Personal Enemy was written with Anthony Creighton (with whom he later wrote Epitaph for George Dillon staged at the Royal Court in 1958). Personal Enemy was staged in regional theatres before he submitted Look Back in Anger.|$|E

25|$|The {{advance of}} Reynier's corps to Reggio deeply troubled Craig and Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Fearing a French {{invasion}} of Sicily, the two procured reinforcements from Malta. Soon after, the sick Craig <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> be succeeded by John Stuart and Collingwood appointed Rear Admiral Sidney Smith {{to command the}} local Royal Navy squadron. Stuart and Smith did not like each other but they agreed to cooperate {{in the defense of}} Sicily. However, Smith's stories of his actions at the 1799 Siege of Acre greatly irritated Stuart. Deciding that a raid on Calabria might forestall a French invasion of Sicily, Smith's squadron took 5,200 of Stuart's troops aboard on 30 June 1806. Underestimating Reynier's strength, they intended to drive the French from Calabria {{with the help of the}} local partisans.|$|E
25|$|Remington {{continued}} sketching but at {{this point}} his results were still cartoonish and amateur. After less than a year, he sold his ranch and went home. After acquiring more capital from his mother, he returned to Kansas City to start a hardware business, but due to an alleged swindle, it failed, and he reinvested his remaining money as a silent, half-owner of a saloon. He <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> marry Eva Caten in 1884 and they returned to Kansas City immediately. She was unhappy with his saloon life and was unimpressed by the sketches of saloon inhabitants that Remington regularly showed her. When his real occupation became known, she left him and returned to Ogdensburg. With his wife gone and with business doing badly, Remington started to sketch and paint in earnest, and bartered his sketches for essentials.|$|E

Her father later stated {{that she had}} been in great spirits, because of her new flat in Holloway, north London, which she had decorated, and there was a {{possibility}} of a career upturn after a few years of a career stall. Later that evening, she complained of feeling unwell, but <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> her flat against her parents' advice.

Concerned, her mother went to Charlotte's flat, to find her lying unconscious on the floor; her asthma inhaler was in a different room.
