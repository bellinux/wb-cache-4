60|$|The {{next day}} Walkirk made his report. He {{had not been}} as {{successful}} as {{he had hoped to}} be. If I had been doing my work in the city, he could have found me stenographers, amanuenses, or type-writers by the hundred. By living and working in the country, I made his task much more difficult. He had found but few persons who were willing to come to me every day, no matter <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> and only one or two who would consent to come to our village to live.|$|E

60|$|He {{occasionally}} {{heard footsteps}} above him, and wondered whether that {{also was a}} cell, {{and what sort of}} man the prisoner was. Once or twice at night, when all was quiet, he heard loud cries, and wondered whether they were the result of delirium or torture. His gruff jailer was somewhat won by his cheerfulness. Every day Godfrey wished him good morning as he visited the cell, inquired <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> was like outside, expressed an earnest hope that silence didn't disagree with him, and generally joked and laughed as if he rather enjoyed himself than otherwise. At {{the end of the week}} an official entered the cell.|$|E

A man of means, genial character, and a bachelor, he was an object of great {{interest}} to his neighbours, and to his neighbours' wives and daughters. But he took little note of this, and had made it his business to go twice a week, no matter <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> to the now farmhouse at Froom-Everard, a wing of which had been retained as the refuge of Christine. He always walked, to give no trouble in putting up a horse to a housekeeper whose staff was limited.|$|E

60|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objection to}} this view is logical, and consists in a criticism of its doctrine as to relations. I shall omit this line of argument, which I have developed elsewhere.* For the moment I will content myself with saying that the powers of logic seem to me very much less than this theory supposes. If it were taken seriously, its advocates ought to profess that any one truth is logically inferable from any other, and that, for example, the fact that Caesar conquered Gaul, if adequately considered, would enable us to discover <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> will be to-morrow. No such claim is put forward in practice, {{and the necessity of}} empirical observation is not denied; but according to the theory it ought to be.|$|E
60|$|Poor David Boone, having sold {{himself to}} the tempter, went about his duties like an abject slave. He began by {{ordering}} goods from various wholesale dealers in the city, after which he took occasion to stand a good deal at his shop door and accost such of his neighbours as chanced to pass. The conversation at such times invariably began with the interesting topic of the weather, on which abstruse subject Boone and his friends displayed a surprising profundity of knowledge, by stating not only <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> {{was at the time}} being, and what it had been in time past, but what it was likely to be in time to come. It soon diverged, however, to business, and usually ended in a display of fresh goods and invoices, and in references, on the part of Boone, to the felicitous state of trade at the time.|$|E
60|$|Tommy Tit hung head {{downward}} from a twig {{while he}} picked some tiny insect eggs from the under side of it. It didn't {{seem to make}} the least difference to Tommy whether he was right side up or upside down. He was a little animated bunch {{of black and white}} feathers, not much bigger than Jenny Wren. The top of his head, back of his neck and coat were shining black. The sides of his head and neck were white. His back was ashy. His sides were a soft cream-buff, and his wing and tail feathers were edged with white. His tiny bill was black, and his little black eyes snapped and twinkled in a way good to see. Not one among all Peter's friends is such a merry-hearted little fellow as Tommy Tit the Chickadee. Merriment and happiness bubble out of him all the time, no matter <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is. He is the friend of everyone and seems to feel that everyone is his friend.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently, {{when the}} Spanish {{expatriate}} composer Roberto Gerhard came to Ann Arbor, Reynolds gravitated towards him:I was {{captivated by the}} uncommon dimensionality of this man. Not only was he a superb musician and an inventive, even commanding composer of uncluttered, poised, and original music, {{but he was also}} both deeply intelligent and emotionally vulnerable. His susceptibility to injury, the outrage he displayed at ethical injustices, the touching warmth he offered from behind a vestigial Spanish crustiness these made an irresistible combination.From Gerhard, Reynolds absorbed the idea that composition took [...] "the whole man... you must put everything that you have and everything that you are into every musical act.

5000|$|In <b>What's</b> Up With <b>the</b> <b>Weather,</b> a 2000 Nova and Frontline documentary, Palfreman and his {{production}} team explored {{the science and}} politics behind climate change. In what critics described as a [...] "sensible and realistic approach to an issue badly skewed by high emotion and low politics", Palfreman explores climatology and greenhouse gases, the extinction crisis, and alternatives to fossil fuel use. According to Palfreman, global warming {{is an issue that}} will [...] "eclipse all the previous controversies over DDT, asbestos, toxic metals, radiation and even tobacco."
