25|$|In geometry, a {{body with}} a single stable resting {{position}} is called monostatic, and the term mono-monostatic has been coined to describe a body which additionally has only one unstable point of balance. (The previously known monostatic polyhedron does not qualify, as it has three unstable equilibria.) A sphere weighted so that its center of mass is shifted from the geometrical center is a mono-monostatic body. A more common example is the Comeback Kid, <b>Weeble</b> or roly-poly toy (see left figure). Not only {{does it have a}} low center of mass, but it also has a specific shape. At equilibrium, the center of mass and the contact point are on the line perpendicular to the ground. When the toy is pushed, its center of mass rises and also shifts away from that line. This produces a righting moment which returns the toy to the equilibrium position.|$|E
50|$|Combining these {{characteristics}} produces a basic <b>Weeble.</b> In theory, {{it is not}} possible to have a <b>Weeble</b> with a centroid that is too low to achieve a stable mechanical equilibrium.|$|E

This means that when the <b>Weeble</b> is wobbled, as in position B, the center of mass will be {{on the other side of}} the pivot point (where the <b>Weeble</b> is in contact with the ground), and so gravity will cause it to return to an upright position.|$|E
50|$|Weebles is a {{trademark}} for several lines of children's roly-poly toys originating in Hasbro's Playskool division on July 23, 1971. Tipping an egg-shaped <b>Weeble</b> causes a weight {{located at the}} bottom-center to be lifted off the ground. Once released, gravitational force brings the <b>Weeble</b> back into an upright position. Weebles {{have been designed to}} have a variety of shapes, including some designed to look like people and animals, among others.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Weeble</b> {{is shaped}} like an egg—in {{order for the}} physics {{principles}} to work as intended, the shape must have a bottom which is {{a more or less}} smooth (unfaceted) [...] (to allow the <b>Weeble</b> to roll) and from the central vertical axis the shape must be nearly cylindrically symmetrical (that is, any plane cut through the vertical axis line must produce close to the same profile). Next, the shape must be filled with two basic types of unmixed solids, and the volume of the lighter solid must be greater than that of the heavier solid. Next, the overall shape must have constant positive curvature. Next, the relationship between the heavy solid and the light solid must be such that any orientation of the object off of the vertical axis line must cause the object's centroid to raise and to become offset. Lastly, the object must have only one position in which it can achieve stable mechanical equilibrium.|$|E

Ectopic, expressed copies of tko 25 t and mRpL 14 conferred no phenotypicsuppression.

40|$|AbstractWeeble mutant mice {{have severe}} {{locomotor}} instability and significant neuronal {{loss in the}} cerebellum and in the hippocampal CA 1 field. Genetic mapping was used to localize the mutation to the gene encoding inositol polyphosphate 4 -phosphatase type I (Inpp 4 a), where a single nucleotide deletion results in a likely null allele. The substrates of INPP 4 A are intermediates in a pathway affecting intracellular Ca 2 + release but are also involved in cell cycle regulation through binding the Akt protooncogene; dysfunction in either {{may account for the}} neuronal loss of <b>weeble</b> mice. Although other mutations in phosphoinositide enzymes are associated with synaptic defects without neuronal loss, <b>weeble</b> shows that Inpp 4 a is critical for the survival of a subset of neurons during postnatal development in mice...|$|E
40|$|In Exercise in Losing Control (2007) and We Are for You Because We are Against Them (2010), Austrian-born artist Noemi Lakmaier {{represents}} Otherness – and, in particular, {{the experience}} of Otherness as one of being vulnerable, dependent or visibly different from everyone else in a social situation – by placing first herself then a group of participants in big circular balls she calls ‘Weebles’. In doing so, Lakmaier depicts Otherness as an absurd, ambiguous or illegible element in otherwise everyday ‘living installations’ in which people meet, converse, dine and connect with spectators and passersby on the street. In this paper I analyse the way spectators and passersby respond to the weeble-wearers. Not surprisingly, responses vary – from people who hurry away, to {{people who try to}} talk to the weeble-wearer, to people who try to kick or tip the <b>weeble</b> to test its reality. The not-quite-normal situation, and the visibility of the spectators in the situation, asks spectators to rehearse their response to corporeal differences that might be encountered in day-to-day life. As the range of comments, confrontations and struggles show, the situation transfers the ill-at-ease, embarrassed and awkward aspects of dealing with corporeal difference from the disabled performer to the able spectator-become-performer. In this paper, I theorise some of the self-conscious spectatorial responses this sort of work can provoke in terms of an ethics of embarrassment. As the Latin roots of the word attest, embarrassment is born of a block, barrier or obstacle to move smoothly through a social or communicative encounter. In Lakmaier’s work, a range of potential blocks present themselves. The spectators’ responses – from ignoring the <b>weeble,</b> to querying the <b>weeble,</b> to asking visual, verbal or physical questions about how the <b>weeble</b> works, and so on – are ways of managing the interruption and moving forward. They are, I argue, strategies for moving from confusion to comprehension, or from what Emmanuel Levinas would call an encounter with the unknown to back into the horizon of the known, classified and classifiable. They flag the potential for what Levinas would call an ethical face-to-face encounter with the Other in which spectators and passersby may unexpectedly find themselves in a vulnerable position...|$|E
40|$|The gene causing {{congenital}} progressive ataxia and spastic paresis (CPA) in Large White piglets remains unknown. This lethal neuropathy manifests {{shortly after}} birth, and is inherited {{as a single}} autosomal recessive allele cosegregating with the microsatellite SW 9021 on SSC 3, which approximately corresponds to position 90 – 110 Mb on HSA 2. 2 INPP 4 A (inositol polyphosphate- 4 -phosphatase, type 1) and SLC 5 A 7 (solute carrier family 5, choline transporter, member 7) are attractive positional and functional candidates as they map within this region and are also involved in diseases with similar phenotypes. A 1 -bp deletion in INPP 4 A causes the <b>weeble</b> (wbl) mutation in mice, a disorder characterized by severe locomotor instability and ataxia. 3 SLC 5 A 7 encodes a transmembrane transporter in neurons; a missense mutation in a gene of the same family in cattle (SLC 35 A 3) {{has been shown to}} cause complex vertebral malformations and locomotor instability. ...|$|E
40|$|Low cost {{networks}} of wireless {{sensors can be}} distributed {{to provide information about}} an environment. Even a network of sensors providing scalar measurements (for instance, of temperature) presents both formidable challenges in terms of integrating and interpreting measurements over space and time, and important opportunities in extended observations. Cameras are particularly powerful multidimensional sensors for dispersing in unknown environments for surveillance and tracking of activity. Understanding the spatial patterns of such activity requires the camera network to self-organize in terms of understanding relative positions of nodes. Cameras also pose problems for resource limited motes because of the high volumes of image data for local processing or transmission. We describe a self-righting or <b>weeble</b> node architecture for camera networks based on integrating a low cost camera into the Mica 2 sensor node platform. The node uses a wide field of view lens (typically called a fish eye lens) which allows us to capture a very broad region around the node providing greater view overlap between the nodes and generally a larger frame for identifying and tracking activity...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{distinctive}} {{requirements of}} white-space networks is the power asymmetry. Static nodes are allowed to transmit with 15 dB- 20 dB higher power than mobile nodes. This poses significant coexistence problems, as high-power nodes can easily starve low-power nodes. In this paper, we propose <b>Weeble,</b> a novel distributed and state-less MAC protocol that solves the coexistence problem. One of the key building blocks is an adaptive preamble support, an add-on to the PHY layer that allows high-power nodes to detect a low-power transmission even when the difference in transmit power {{is as high as}} 20 dB. The other key building block is a MAC protocol that exploits the adaptive preambles functionality. It implements a virtual carrier-sensing and automatically adapts the preamble size to optimize network performance. We extensively evaluate our sys-tem in a test-bed and in simulations. We show that we can prevent starvation of low-power nodes in almost all existing scenarios and improve the data rates of low-power links several-fold over existing MACs, and as a trade-off we decrease the throughput {{of the rest of the}} system by 20 %- 40 %.

40|$|Endosomal {{trafficking}} {{is regulated}} by the recruitment of effector proteins to phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate [PtdIns(3) P] on early endosomes. At the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4) -bisphosphate [PtdIns(3, 4) P 2] binds the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins Akt and TAPP 1. Type Iα inositol polyphosphate 4 -phosphatase (4 -phosphatase) dephosphorylates PtdIns(3, 4) P 2, forming PtdIns(3) P, but its subcellular localization is unknown. We report here in quiescent cells, the 4 -phosphatase colocalized with early and recycling endosomes. On growth factor stimulation, 4 -phosphatase endosomal localization persisted, but in addition the 4 -phosphatase localized at the plasma membrane. Overexpression of the 4 -phosphatase in serum-stimulated cells increased cellular PtdIns(3) P levels and prevented wortmannin-induced endosomal dilatation. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous <b>Weeble</b> mice, which have a mutation in the type I 4 -phosphatase, exhibited dilated early endosomes. 4 -Phosphatase translocation to the plasma membrane upon growth factor stimulation inhibited the recruitment of the TAPP 1 PH domain. The 4 -phosphatase contains C 2 domains, which bound PtdIns(3, 4) P 2, and C 2 -domain-deletion mutants lost PtdIns(3, 4) P 2 4 -phosphatase activity, did not localize to endosomes or inhibit TAPP 1 PH domain membrane recruitment. The 4 -phosphatase therefore both generates and terminates phosphoinositide 3 -kinase signals at distinct subcellular locations...|$|E
40|$|Generation and {{turnover}} of phosphoinositides (PIs) must be coordinated in a spatial- and temporal-restricted manner. The small GTPase Rab 5 interacts with two PI 3 -kinases, Vps 34 and PI 3 Kβ, {{suggesting that it}} regulates the production of 3 -PIs at various stages of the early endocytic pathway. Here, we discovered that Rab 5 also interacts directly with PI 5 - and PI 4 -phosphatases and stimulates their activity. Rab 5 regulates the production of phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate (PtdIns[3]P) through a dual mechanism, by directly phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol via Vps 34 and by a hierarchical enzymatic cascade of phosphoinositide- 3 -kinaseβ (PI 3 Kβ), PI 5 -, and PI 4 -phosphatases. The functional importance of such an enzymatic pathway is demonstrated by the inhibition of transferrin uptake upon silencing of PI 4 -phosphatase and studies in <b>weeble</b> mutant mice, where deficiency of PI 4 -phosphatase causes an increase of PtdIns(3, 4) P 2 {{and a reduction in}} PtdIns(3) P. Activation of PI 3 -kinase at the plasma membrane is accompanied by the recruitment of Rab 5, PI 4 -, and PI 5 -phosphatases to the cell cortex. Our data provide the first evidence for a dual role of a Rab GTPase in regulating both generation and {{turnover of}} PIs via PI kinases and phosphatases to coordinate signaling functions with organelle homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|The <b>weeble</b> mutant mouse has a {{frame shift}} {{mutation}} in inositol polyphosphate 4 -phosphatase type I (Inpp 4 a). The phenotype is characterized by an early onset cerebellar ataxia and neurodegeneration, especially apparent in the Purkinje cells. Purkinje cell loss is a common pathological finding in many human and mouse ataxic disorders. Here we show that in the Inpp 4 a wbl mutant, Purkinje cells are lost in a specific temporal and spatial pattern. Loss occurs early in postnatal development; however, prior to the appearance of climbing fibers in the developing molecular layer, the mutant has a normal complement of Purkinje cells and they are properly positioned. Degeneration and reactive gliosis are present at postnatal day 5 and progress rapidly in a defined pattern of patches; however, Inpp 4 a is expressed uniformly across Purkinje cells. In late stage mutants, patches of surviving Purkinje cells appear remarkably normal with the exception that the climbing fibers have been excessively eliminated. Surviving Purkinje cells express Eaat 4, a glutamate transporter that is differentially expressed in subsets of Purkinje cells during development and into adult stages. Prior to Purkinje cell loss, reactive gliosis and dendritic atrophy {{can be seen in}} Eaat 4 negative stripes. Our data suggest that Purkinje cell loss in the Inpp 4 a wbl mutant is due to glutamate excitotoxicity initiated by the climbing fiber, and that Eaat 4 may exert a protective effect...|$|E
