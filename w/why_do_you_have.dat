25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch {{a piece of the}} news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
2500|$|Both [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{and second}} single [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] were largely ignored by U.S. country radio {{and failed to}} {{penetrate}} the top 35 of the Hot Country Songs chart. [...] In June 2006, Emily Robison noted {{the lack of support}} from other country music performers: [...] "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." [...] Maines commented, [...] "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism." [...] In Europe, however, the two singles were well received by country radio, peaking at Nos. 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each.|$|E

The line [...] "So, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be so Nazi" [...] was changed to [...] "So, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be so nasty", and [...] "Camp 49 way down on the Rhine" [...] was changed to [...] "A lover of mine from down on the Rhine".

6000|$|... "O, Frederic! it's YOU is the cause, and not I. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any mistry from me? Where do {{you spend}} your days? Why did you leave me, even {{on the day of}} your marridge, for eight hours, and {{continue}} to do so every day?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, stiffen your {{backbone}} {{and stick}} out your chin, and square your elbows, and really amount to something. Why do you simply flop about {{and do nothing}} and leave everything to what you call 'the family'? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be helped all the time? Why don't you help yourself? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have jobs found for you? Why don't you rush out and get one? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to worry about what, 'the family' thinks of you? Why don't you make yourself independent of them? I know you had hard luck, suddenly finding yourself without money and all that, but, good heavens, {{everybody else in the}} world who has ever done anything has been broke at one time or another. It's part of the fun. You'll never get anywhere by letting yourself be picked up by the family like... like a floppy Newfoundland puppy and dumped down in any old place that happens to suit them. A job's a thing you've got to choose for yourself and get for yourself. Think what you can do--there must be something--and then go at it with a snort and grab it and hold it down and teach it to take a joke. You've managed to collect some money. It will give you time to look round. And, when you've had a look round, do something! Try to realize you're alive, and try to imagine the family isn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You take {{yourself}} very seriously, Everard," [...] she observed, {{looking at}} him with a puzzled expression. [...] "One would think that there was a side of your life, and a very important one, which you kept entirely to yourself. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> that funny little man Seaman always round with you? You're not being blackmailed or anything, are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am glad I {{let him get}} safely {{away before}} I came back, for I {{certainly}} couldn't have held in when he proposed that, if I had been here. I don't understand you, Brice! <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> anything {{more to do with}} him? Why do you let him touch the new play?

6000|$|... "Why," [...] he said, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{nothing but}} cruelty in your heart, and {{contempt}} for her? When {{you saw that}} she was willing, for the love of the son whom you loved, to give up all that life meant to her, how could you destroy her without a qualm? The crime you committed was that you refused to see God in that woman's soul, when he had revealed himself to you. You looked for wile, for cunning, for self-seeking,--and they were not there. Love had obliterated them. When you saw how meekly she obeyed you, and agreed to go away, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>have</b> pity? If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> listened to your conscience, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> known what to do.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> children? <b>Why</b> weren't <b>you</b> celibate? They <b>have</b> to {{live among}} men.

6000|$|... "Why," [...] say I, lapsing {{into the}} Italian rhetorical manner, [...] "why {{do you keep}} an inn? Why do you write the word Ristorante so large, when {{you have nothing to}} offer people, and don't intend to have anything. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the impudence to take in travellers? What does it mean, that this is an inn? What, say, what does it mean? Say then--what does it mean? What does it mean, your Ristorante Risveglio, written so large?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, all kinds. How does it pay? How did {{you manage}} it all? How much did the land cost? Did you build that {{beautiful}} house? How much do you pay the men? How did you learn all {{the different kinds of}} things, and which grew best and which paid best? What {{is the best way to}} sell them? How do you sell them?" [...] Saxon paused and laughed. [...] "Oh, I haven't begun yet. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> flowers on the borders everywhere?

60|$|CURTIS--I {{feel that}} you are {{deliberately}} ruining my highest hope. How can I go on without you? I've been trying to imagine myself alone. I can't!

Haven't we been sufficient, you and I together? Isn't that a more difficult, beautiful happiness to achieve than--children? Everyone has children. Don't I love {{you as much as}} any man could love a woman? Isn't that enough for you? Doesn't it mean anything to you that I need you so terribly--for myself, for my work--for everything that is best and worthiest in me? Can you expect me to be glad when you propose to introduce a stranger who will steal away your love, your interest--who will separate us and deprive me of you! No, no, I cannot! It's asking the impossible. I am only human.|$|E
5000|$|Violet often teased Charlie Brown (often {{adding a}} series of Nyah's), who often makes comebacks. In an example of such, Violet once said to him, [...] "It simply {{goes without saying that}} you are an {{inferior}} human being."
