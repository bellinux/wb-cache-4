40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of antibacterial activity of the essential oils of the most commonly grown ornamental-type basils (five types) {{as well as that of}} wild-type basil which spontaneously grows in large pure stands during the rainy season. The essential oils of all six basil types showed strong antibacterial activity against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium. This activity was dose-dependent. Calculated LD 50 values varied between 40 and 325 μL of crude essential oil/well, for the three bacteria, using the agar well diffusion method. The crude essential oil of <b>wild</b> Sudanese <b>basil,</b> assayed by the disc diffusion method, had three TLC-separated compounds which were active against Salmonella typhimurium. One of these was identified as geraniol, a major constituent of the essential oil. Thus basil essential oil has potential clinical or food applications as an antibacterial agent...|$|R

He calms Dorian by assuring him that she was less real than Shakespeare's heroines that she portrayed. Dorian agrees to go to the opera with him that night. Looking again at the altered portrait, he resolves to let it represent the life he shall now lead, in search of 'pleasures secret and subtle, wild joys and <b>wilder</b> sins'. <b>Basil</b> arrives to console Dorian for the loss of Sibyl, but is dismayed to find Dorian calmly dressing for the opera. Although Basil feels unease, he promises to Dorian never to speak again about the matter. After Basil departs, Dorian tells his butler, before going to the opera, to hire two men to move the painting to the attic. He finally looks into a gilt hand mirror.|$|R
40|$|Skin {{constantly}} {{is exposed}} to environmental oxidative stressors such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR), air pollutants, chemical oxidants and aerobic microorganisms. 1, 2 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered major contributors to skin aging, cancer and certain skin disorders 3 since they react negatively with DNA, proteins and unsaturated fatty acids. 4 In addition, while healthy skin possesses an innate antioxidant defense system, ROS and other free radicals or excessive free radical attack can overwhelm the cutaneous antioxidant capacity, depleting the skin’s antioxidants and damaging biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. This further leads to oxidative damage, skin cancer, immunosuppression and premature skin aging. Therefore, supplying exogenous antioxidants topically to the endogenous antioxidant system is one approach to preventing or minimizing ROS-induced photoaging. 5 With growing consumer appeal for natural and organic products, botanical extracts have become among {{the most commonly used}} ingredients in OTC antiaging cosmetic preparations. More recently, claims have focused on their antioxidant properties and ability to modulate certain types of environmental damage. Essential oils in particular, traditionally used for aromatic properties, have good penetration into the skin, which enhances their efficacy. 6 In the present article, the authors evaluate the chemical composition and biological activities—i. e., antioxidative, antibacterial and antifungal—of <b>wild</b> Amazonian <b>basil</b> Ocimum micranthum Willd. (also known as O. campechianum Mill.) Labiatae essential oil, and compare these properties with those of commercially available common basil Ocimum basilicum and Thymus vulgaris essential oils. 7 In addition, in view of their high antioxidant capacities, the oils were further assessed to determine if their functional capacity could be expressed in finished cosmetic products, and whether the type of formulation could influence the expression of their antioxidant activity...|$|R
60|$|This {{adventure}} of ours {{was destined to}} differ in one respect from others which I have narrated. I had been through many <b>wild</b> days with <b>Basil</b> Grant, days {{for the first half}} of which the sun and the moon seemed to have gone mad. But it had almost invariably happened that towards the end of the day and its adventure things had cleared themselves like the sky after rain, and a luminous and quiet meaning had gradually dawned upon me. But this day's work was destined to end in confusion worse confounded. Before we left that house, ten minutes afterwards, one half-witted touch was added which rolled all our minds in cloud. If Rupert's head had suddenly fallen off on the floor, if wings had begun to sprout out of Greenwood's shoulders, we could scarcely have been more suddenly stricken. And yet of this we had no explanation. We had to go to bed that night with the prodigy and get up next morning with it and let it stand in our memories for weeks and months. As will be seen, it was not until months afterwards that by another accident and in another way it was explained. For the present I only state what happened.|$|R

Each flower has a short stalk, five sepals about 10 mm long and five petals 12 to 15 mm in length which are fused into a tube. The flowers are pink, violet or purple and have two lips.

40|$|In recent years, {{essential}} oils have gained commercial {{interest in the}} agricultural area, mainly for their allelopathic, insecticidal, antifungal, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, and, also for their natural compounds, which have generally displayed low toxicity, relatively low cost and rapid degradation in the environment. Medicinal plants have emerged as potential suppliers of {{essential oils}} because of their ethnopharmacological utility. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the allelopathic potential of essential oils extracted from fresh leaves of lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus), <b>wild</b> <b>basil</b> (Ocimum gratissimum L.) and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) with regard to their major constituents (citral, eugenol and cineol, respectively) in different application forms (direct contact and the effect of volatile constituents) on the germination and vigor of lettuce seeds (cultivar Regina SF 3500). The effects of the oils and their major components were evaluated with regard to the variables: first germination count, total germination, GVI (germination velocity index), seedling dry weight and average lengths of shoots and lettuce roots. The essential oils from lemon grass and basil displayed allelopathic potentials on seed germination and vigor of lettuce achenes that can be assigned to their respective major constituents citral and eugenol. On the other hand, the allelopathic effect of the essential oil from basil was a consequence of the combined effect of all the components, regardless the application method. ...|$|E
