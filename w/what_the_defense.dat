The case against her was very strong, he said, and thus she might well be at risk to flee the country or obtain weapons through her husband. Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, said the judge did not understand the case well and contrasted the high figure with the $1 million set for Robert Blake and Phil Spector when they were charged with murder. Several months later, her brother claimed she was not receiving adequate treatment for an unspecified cancer while in custody, either.|$|E

50|$|The Run & Shoot {{system uses}} a {{formation}} consisting of one {{running back and}} usually four wide receivers, although some variants have substituted an athletic and bigger tight end to help block for the running game. This system makes extensive use of receiver motion (having a receiver suddenly change position by running left or right, parallel {{to the line of}} scrimmage, just before the ball is snapped), both to create advantageous mismatches with the opposing defensive players and to help reveal <b>what</b> coverage <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> is using.|$|R
5000|$|Coach Schembechler denied {{there was}} any controversy, and Taylor {{returned}} to the line-up in the fifth game against Iowa. Taylor was impressive in his return, completing 11 of 15 pass attempts, including 2 touchdown passes, and also scored a rushing touchdown as the Wolverines beat the Hawkeyes 26 - 12. After the game, Taylor said, [...] "I think I did all right. I took <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> gave me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Use {{motion and}} {{formations}} {{to spread the}} defense out and anticipate <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> is going to do. If one uses motion and the defensive back follows the motioning receiver, they are probably playing man coverage or blitzing. If no defensive back follows the motion receiver, then they are probably playing zone defense, although this tactic has partly faded {{with the addition of}} zone blitzes by defenses since the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Personnel {{combinations}} {{never need}} to be changed because they are not dictated by the defensive coverage. As a result, a team can go down the field using the same personnel without having to change from their base formation due to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> has lined up in. As a result, if a defense lines up in a base 3-4, then switches to a base 4-3 formation on the next snap, offenses don't need to substitute to counter this.|$|E

50|$|The Scheme {{is notable}} for being very pass centric {{with as many}} as 65-75% of the calls during a season being a pass play. A large reason is due to the control that is placed on the QB who has the freedom to audible to any play based on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> is showing him at the line of scrimmage. In at least one instance, {{as a result of the}} QB's ability to audible, as many as 90% of the run plays called in a season were audibled to at the line of scrimmage.|$|E
50|$|Another aspect {{that makes}} the West Coast offense {{one of the most}} {{difficult}} to master is that it requires a deeper connection between quarterback and receiver, and an ability to communicate mid-play. On any given route, a receiver has as many as three options; a hitch, a slant and a fly, depending on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> is showing. The quarterback is responsible for recognizing the defense and the reaction of the receiver to it and adjusting the route if needed. This explains the communication mistakes that commonly occur on West Coast offensive plays where the quarterback throws to a spot that the receiver is running away from.|$|E
5000|$|By {{reading the}} DB, the WRs {{are able to}} run routes to {{uncovered}} areas in zone coverage or simply beat their defender in coverage. This allows the QB {{to go down the}} field vertically or take <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> gives him and go underneath (throw short passes in front of the defensive coverage personnel) to let his WR get yards after the catch (hopefully [...] "make a play"). Since a lot of the routes are downfield to vertically challenge the outside and seams, successful QBs can not only put up staggering numbers but it also allows them to put up very high yard per completion numbers.|$|E

5000|$|Moe used a run-and-gun offense {{which had}} his team shoot before the opponent's defense had set up. He ran almost no plays, instead relying on ball movement, screens and {{constant}} {{cuts to the}} basket. Players were not {{to hold onto the}} ball for longer than two seconds. The movement of the ball was predicated on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> allowed. [...] "You can't diagram it, you can't put a pencil and paper to it. If you do, you're doing an injustice to the system", said former Nuggets assistant Allan Bristow. Moe simply said, [...] "The passing game is basically doing whatever the hell you want." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{on a trip}} to Disneyland, {{the four}} men {{recorded}} a home video. The Justice Department believed that this recording was reconnaissance for a future terror attack. This video, combined with the testimony of self-described con-artist Youssef Hmimssa, and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> called doodles in a day planner, but the prosecution called terror plans, led to the conviction of Koubriti and Elmardoudi on June 3, 2003. The prosecution claimed the five were [...] "Takfiris" [...] - [...] followers of a radical Islamic sect that allowed mujahideen to drink alcohol, use narcotics, and refrain from praying, in order to blend into Western societies, so they could mount clandestine attacks on them.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor in}} this offense is the {{inclusion}} of the no huddle. The QB and the offense race up to the line of scrimmage, diagnose <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> is showing, and then snap the ball based on the QB's play call. This not only allows a team to come back if they are down a lot as seen in the 2006 Insight Bowl but it also allows them to tire out the defense and allow for bigger runs and bigger pass completions. The fast pace limits the defense's ability to substitute players and adjust their scheme. The hurried pace can cause defensive mental mistakes such as missed assignments or being out of position.|$|E
50|$|On passing plays, {{the offense}} always {{has at least}} five people blocking. From the quarterback's left to his right, they are: left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, right tackle. The Quarterback will throw the pass, and is not an {{available}} blocker. Any other player is available to block, or to be a target for a pass, depending on the play design and modification by the quarterback and center based on <b>what</b> they see <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> doing.The defense can bring all 11 players to blitz the quarterback. This would leave no one to follow and try to stop a target of a pass. So <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> chooses to bring {{a certain number of}} players to try to sack the quarterback, and leaves the rest to protect against a pass. Bringing 4 players or less is not considered a blitz. It is only considered a blitz when <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> rushes more than 4 players.|$|R
5000|$|On June 12, 1959, Betty Jean Owens testified on her {{own behalf}} in front of four hundred witnesses. She retold {{the events of the}} attack to the jury in detail. She told the jury, “I was so scared, but there was nothing I could do with four men, a knife, and a gun ... I couldn’t do {{anything}} but <b>what</b> they said.” <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> attorneys worked diligently to prove that Owens had consented to the attack and argued that if a rape did occur that she would have sustained more serious injuries. The doctors that treated Owens told the jury that her injuries resulted in a five-day hospital stay and that she was in a terrible condition. When the prosecution rested its case, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> attorneys claimed that the state had failed to do anything but prove sexual intercourse had occurred and called for an acquittal. Judge Walker denied the motion and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> was set to return the next day to present their case.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparing}} future budgets, {{the challenge}} {{would be to}} find the right mix between money for operation and maintenance accounts {{on the one hand and}} modernization procurement funds on the other, while facing the prospect of a flat DoD budget of about $250 billion annually for the next decade or so. A relatively new problem that could affect the DoD budget was vertical integration in <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> industry. It occurred on a large scale in the 1990s as mergers of major defense contractors created a few huge dominant companies, particularly in the aerospace industry. They were called vertical because they incorporated most of the elements of the production process, including parts and subcomponents. Cohen and other Pentagon leaders began to worry that vertical integration could reduce competition and in the long run increase <b>the</b> costs of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Department of <b>Defense</b> had to buy.|$|R
50|$|The {{point guard}} (PG), {{also called the}} one or point, {{is one of the}} five {{positions}} in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer). While the guard must understand and accept the coach's gameplan, he must also be able to adapt to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> is allowing, and he also must control the pace of the game.|$|E

50|$|While several NFL {{teams have}} begun using the offense in various ways, many college {{football}} programs {{have used the}} no-huddle or hurry-up {{as a way to}} gain an advantage when lacking talent in comparison to the teams they are playing. One twist on this approach is that often a college team will hurry-up to the line of scrimmage and line up in a set formation. Based on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> is showing in terms of alignment, the quarterback has the option of calling the determined play at the line of scrimmage or stepping back and looking towards the sidelines where the head coach or an assistant will relay a better play to attack the coverage the defense is showing. The Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL have also used this technique with a coach on the sideline telling their quarterback, via the radio receiver in his helmet, information on the defensive alignment; the radio is operative up until 15 seconds on the play clock and hence is only suitable for use when a fast hurry-up offense is used.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} 1-3-1 {{zone defense}} is to create turnovers. This defense focuses extra {{pressure}} on the ball handler and will exert more effort to force turnovers. Turnovers within this defense are created by a couple key features of this strategy. Two defensive players will try to trap the ball handler {{in one of the}} corners of the half court. In basketball the ball can only be held for five seconds before passing, shooting, or dribbling. If a player is trapped in the corner they tend to stop their dribble before making a decision to pass or shoot. This creates a problem for the offense but is exactly <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> wants to happen. When a player is double teamed without their dribble they tend to make poor decisions. Often bad passes and shots are forced out by the player just to get the ball out of the corner. It is vital for players not guarding the ball handler to anticipate a bad pass or shot {{in order to make a}} steal or get a rebound. This will help create the most turnovers.|$|E

Furthermore, Wang Zhi helped the Portuguese traders reach Tanegashima in 1543, where the Portuguese introduced the arquebus to the Japanese for the first time. This armed the Japanese, who already had a reputation for being fearsome swordsmen, with firearms more advanced than <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Chinese coastal <b>defense</b> forces had at the time.

40|$|<b>What</b> shaped <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> {{transformation}} {{policies of}} NATO member-states? And {{what does it}} mean for the future of the alliance? This dissertation explores the impact of the strategic cultures of the United States, the Netherlands and Germany on their efforts to adapt their defense policies and armed forces in light of significant changes in the security environment. Transformation was the central concept around which the Alliance was believed to find renewed cohesion. Instead, transformation in an era of expeditionary operations unearthed divergent views regarding the use of the military instrument. Each state pursued transformation differently and confronted different problems. These difficulties reflected the unique characteristics of their strategic culture. On the basis of the research it can be concluded that effective transformation can only take place when the characteristics of a state's strategic culture are taken into account. For NATO, it means that, unless the security environment changes substantially, friction within the alliance will persist and instead it will be necessary to work with these differences, rather than ignore them at its peril.
