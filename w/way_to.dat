5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E
