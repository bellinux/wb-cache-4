She later apologized for commenting on the presumptive Republican nominee calling her remarks [...] "ill advised"(sic).|$|E
500|$|A {{shortage}} of new {{material and the}} slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan's decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic Robert Shelton, [...] "Oh, I was really down. I mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song... It was the band. But you see, I didn't know that. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that".|$|E

In 2001, Ben and Virginia's son, Kamal, commented on the changes of what types of people were eating at the establishment: [...] "You hear comments. Even the white customers. They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they're the only whites who'd been hip {{enough to go to}} the Chili Bowl. Now they look around {{and there are a lot}} of other whites and they are not so happy about it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for the {{television}} pilot began {{on location in}} Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller's character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, [...] "All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it {{because we had a}} deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of people have seen it, which is embarrassing, because they're bad-quality tapes, too. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Melinda Newman of HitFix {{praised the}} concept of the video, writing: [...] " [...] when [...] busy showing off his dance moves, he is living the high life with his lady in their {{palatial}} estate. He sings to her, she wraps her legs around him, they pose in some awesome topiary gardens. It is not the most thrilling of videos, and he may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> twice about moonwalking in a video-- someone did it before him and better-- but it is a nice change of pace from some of his more hectic, gruffer clips." [...] Cameron Matthews of AOL Music commented that the video gives [...] "a kaleidoscopic view" [...] between Derulo's beachfront paradise, an assortment of [...] "edgy suits" [...] and [...] "a little bit of pillow talk with his new 'It Girl'." [...] According to Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV, [...] "the romance factor in Jason's full-length 'It Girl' video is very, very high." ...|$|E

500|$|Angel {{has said}} that, [...] "I {{stayed away from}} magicians when I was younger because I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> like them and wanted to create my own style." [...] His first {{television}} appearance was in 1994, where he performed {{as a part of}} a one-hour ABC primetime special entitled Secrets. One of the early supporters of Angel was horror director Clive Barker. In 1995, Barker asked Angel to work with him on his film Lord of Illusions. He also later recorded the intro to Angel's album World of Illusion: System One. Barker said of Angel in the mid-1990s that, [...] "Criss Angel is extraordinary, a spectacular mix of visionary magic. This is the future, and it can’t come quickly enough." [...] During that year, he collaborated with musician Klayton to form Angeldust, a show that combined magic with music. They released their first album Musical Conjurings from the World of Conjuring in 1998. Also that year, Angel performed a ten-minute show over the course of the [...] "World of Illusion" [...] conference in Madison Square Garden, performing sixty shows per day. However, by 2000, Klayton's name was removed from Angel's website.|$|E

Fortus said, [...] "I'm pretty much focused on GnR right now.

2500|$|However, {{after the}} war, Hitchens scolded those within the US who had {{opposed the war}} by observing that [...] "the peace {{movement}} {{in this country in}} my opinion acted in a very narrow, isolationist, and almost chauvinistic way. It said that a war was more or less alright with it as long as it could be guaranteed in advance that American casualties could be kept low... I thought that was a dishonourably narrow way of approaching the question. ... When large numbers of Iraqis were turned into soap...and many others, as we've since found out, were bulldozed and buried alive and in other ways done away with and people don't even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the body count ...because they’re afraid of what they might find out." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{controversy}} over who shot first, Greedo or Han Solo, in Episode IV, what I did was try {{to clean up}} the confusion, but obviously it upset people because they <b>wanted</b> Solo <b>to</b> be a cold-blooded killer, but he actually isn't. It had been done in all close-ups and it was confusing about who did what to whom. I put a little wider shot in there that made it clear that Greedo is the one who shot first, but everyone <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Han shot first, because they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that he actually just gunned him down.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial airing, reviews of the show were mostly negative. Matt Roush, writing in USA Today, {{characterized}} the show as [...] "painfully bogus," [...] and a cynical and exploitative new low in television, commenting, [...] "Watching The Real World, which fails as documentary (too phony) and as entertainment (too dull), it's hard to tell who's using who more." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales commented, [...] "Ah to be young, cute, and stupid, and to have too much free time...Such is the lot facing the wayward wastrels of The Real World, something new in excruciating torture from the busy minds at MTV." [...] Shales also remarked upon the cast members’ creative career choices, saying, [...] "You might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about getting a real job." ...|$|E
2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just {{understand}} that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. [...] And this is what I call having a mental image. When I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a chiliagon, I {{understand that it is}} a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura).

2500|$|The Harlem Globetrotters offered Alcindor $1 {{million to}} play for them, but he declined, and was picked first in the 1969 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks (who were in only their second season of existence). The Bucks won a coin-toss with the Phoenix Suns for first pick. He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 American Basketball Association draft by the New York Nets. The Nets {{believed}} {{that they had the}} upper hand in securing Alcindor's services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept one offer only from each team, the Nets bid too low. Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge. After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks' offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying, [...] "A bidding war degrades the people involved. It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Gordon scored {{his record}} 5th {{win in the}} Brickyard 400 after passing Kasey Kahne on a restart with 17 laps to go. The race was {{dominated}} {{by a variety of}} pit strategies. Kasey Kahne lead the most laps in the race with 70 as Hendrick powered cars led 127 of the 160 laps. [...] "Those emotions take over. There's nothing better, especially in a big race, coming to Victory Lane with your family here," [...] said an emotional Gordon. [...] "I was trying so hard with 10 to go not to focus on the crowd. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it too much, but you can't help it." [...] "Looking back, I should have chosen the (outside lane)," [...] Kahne said. [...] "They pretty much let Jeff control that restart.

But I didn't spin a tire and Jeff drove right by me before we were even got to the second (restart line)." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, she {{was listed}} by People {{as one of}} the [...] "50 most {{beautiful}} people in the world". In 1995, Empire chose her {{as one of the}} [...] "100 sexiest stars in film history", and in October 1997, she was ranked among the [...] "top 100 film stars of all time" [...] by the magazine. In 1999, she was rated among the [...] "25 sexiest stars of the century" [...] by Playboy. She {{has been the subject of}} four television documentary specials, and several biograhies have been written about her. On her sex symbol image, Stone told Oprah Winfrey on Oprah Prime in 2014: [...] "It's a pleasure for me now. I mean, I'm gonna be 56 years old. If people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I'm a sex symbol, it's, like, yeah. Think it up. You know. I mean, like, good for me". In 2015, Stone posed naked for the September issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine, in which she stated: [...] "At a certain point you start asking yourself, 'What really is sexy?' It’s not just the elevation of your boobs. It’s being present and having fun and liking yourself enough to like the person that's with you".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} they had been separated, the duo had already broken several records. When Dravid hit an {{exemplary}} cover-drive to bring up the 250 of the partnership, they became the first batting pair to put on two stands excess of 250 against Australia. After their stand ended, however, Dravid felt least unperturbed and forged a partnership of 59 with the young Parthiv Patel, who played well for a composed 31, which consisted of three successive fours off MacGill, but the partnership ended when Patel drove Katich to Ponting. At 447/6, the new man Ajit Agarkar came in and Dravid stitched a stand of 22 with him and then Agarkar too departed at 469/7. Finally, with the new man Kumble, Dravid added 8 runs before the play was finished for the day. He finished tantalizingly at 199 not out, an innings which was built slowly, yet steadily. This was his first test hundred in Australia, and this was an innings which [...] "laughed at the face of that innuendo". Sambit Bal, noted cricinfo author argued that Dravid could have completed any easy double hundred had he not refused easy runs in order to shield the lower-order batsmen. Bal also described Dravid's batting as being [...] "picture perfect. It describes balance, poise and symmetry". Laxman and Dravid had frustrated Australia so much on that day, that their partnership seemed to be an encore of that 376 that had put on together at Kolkata in 2000–01. Laxman had scored a double century back then, and Dravid seemed to be on the cusp of another one. in fact, when Ricky Ponting was asked {{at the end of the}} previous day whether Dravid and Laxman's partnership brought back memories of Kolkata 2000–01, Ponting was reported to have said, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of that." ...|$|E

I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that out; and moreover I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but thinking {{was out of the question}} in the circumstances.
