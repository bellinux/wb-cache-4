40|$|This {{technical}} memorandum (TM) {{documents the}} 1995 characterization of eight underground radioactive waste tanks at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). These tanks {{belong to the}} Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) operable unit, and the characterization {{is part of the}} ongoing GAAT remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) process. This TM reports both field observations and analytical results; analytical results are also available from the Oak Ridge Environmental Information System (OREIS) data base under the project name GAAT (PROJ-NAME = GAAT). This characterization effort (Phase II) was a follow-up to the {open_quotes}Phase I{close_quotes} sampling campaign reported in Results of Fall 1994 Sampling of Gunite and Associated Tanks at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, ORNL/ER/Sub/ 87 - 99053 / 74, June 1995. The information contained here should be used in conjunction with that in the previous TM. The sampling plan is documented in ORNL Inactive Waste Tanks Sampling and Analysis Plan, ORNL/RAP/LTR- 88 / 24, dated April 1988, as amended by Addendum 1, Revision 2 : ORNL Inactive Tanks Sampling and Analysis Plan, DOE/OR/ 02 - 1354 &D 2, dated February 1995.

40|$|Software {{maintenance}} {{is one of}} the most expensive phases in software en-gineering, as shown by studies from the 1970 s until today. Some practitioners consider operational and maintenance costs to require as much as 85 - 90 % of their project budgets [3]. Thus, making software maintenance more efficient has po-tential to considerably reduce overall development costs. Issue management is a central part of software maintenance, revolving around issue reports collected in a central repository. Large organizations receive 10, 000 s of issue reports yearly, resulting in challenging prioritization decisions and work allocation. Our work aims to support issue management by providing automated deci-sion support [2]. A fundamental approach in our work is to make use of the rich information in issue repositories, i. e., to let previous <b>work</b> <b>guide</b> future decisions in issue management. Issue reports typically contain both text describing the experienced problem and other pieces of (often nominal or ordinal) information such as the version of the faulty software, the severity of the issue, and details on the execution environment.

40|$|There is {{consensus}} of {{opinion of the}} value of critical reflective practice for student learning, professional development and employability. Yet, students are known to struggle with reflective practice. The purpose of this research is to describe a proposed design for an innovative multidisciplinary online program for Work Integrated Learning [WIL], which facilitates and guides reflective thinking while developing metacognitive awareness of employability skills and attributes. The paper discusses the theoretical framework and envisaged design of this online resource. Reflection and application is introduced in three stages. In stage 1, [Pre-Placement], the student reflects on their preparedness for WIL using the tool informed by the Work Skill Development Framework (WSD) [Bandaranaike & Willison, 2009]. Questioning techniques together with skill statements derived from the WSD six facets of <b>work,</b> <b>guide</b> students through the process of self-identifying current employability skill sets. This process is then elaborated by self-appraising the degree of autonomy across a continuum for each employability skill identified. In stage 2, [In- Placement], the student collects evidence of applying practice based work skills. The progressive development of skills and the acquisition of new skills are mapped to a WSD informed online template. In stage 3 [Post-Placement] the student re-identifies and re-appraises skill competencies by reflecting on the WSD's degrees of autonomy. Reflections submitted gradually compile a personalised employability skills profile of a student's WIL journey. The artefacts that will be produce will enhance student feedback, inform WIL discussions with stakeholders and empower students with the 'language' needed for future employment...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability {{science is}} {{difficult}} to conceptualise, plan and conduct, given {{the broad range of}} epistemological commitments, methodological practices, and approaches to problem-framing taken by its constituent disciplines. This special issue is based on the idea of place as a boundary device for the sustainability sciences, in the belief that it can foster integrative <b>work,</b> <b>guide</b> theoretical reflection, encourage methodological innovation, and inform empirical research. Here we reflect on place concepts, before developing a series of arguments on the relationship of place to sustainability science. We first emphasise that place is not solely an interpretivist or post-positivist perspective on sustainability, as it is also congenial to mechanistic or positivist ontologies. Secondly, we argue that place does not entail a retreat from theory into particularism or thick description; it is coherent with attempts to provide explanations. Thirdly, we claim that it does not imply a sedentary, parochial approach to sustainability science that neglects interactions across scale or location. Fourthly, we caution that public spheres for tackling environmental issues can act to close-down deliberation and marginalise informal knowledge, if institutions retain norms that emphasise abstract, placeless evidence. We highlight how these ideas have been cashed out in the collected papers in this special issue, in domains ranging from biofuels governance, to estuary management, to marine governance, to ecosystem stewardship, to community-led low energy transitions, and to climate change more broadly. We end by suggesting that a place-based approach to sustainability science entails a relentless focus on context. It takes the spatially patterned, heterogeneous, fluid, networked, and contextually moderated form of socio-environmental processes as central points of investigation, rather than as mere modifiers of more general mechanisms...|$|E
