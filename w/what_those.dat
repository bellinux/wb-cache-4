5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, <b>what</b> <b>those</b> pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, Hyman and Honorton {{published}} A Joint Communiqué which {{agreed on}} the methodological problems and on ways to fix them. They suggested a computer-automated control, where randomization and the other methodological problems identified were eliminated. Hyman and Honorton agreed that replication of the studies was necessary before final conclusions could be drawn. They also agreed that more stringent standards were necessary for ganzfeld experiments, and they jointly specified <b>what</b> <b>those</b> standards should be.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary mission}} of the Viking probes of the mid-1970s was to carry out {{experiments}} designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil because the favorable conditions {{for the evolution of}} multicellular organisms ceased some four billion years ago on Mars. The tests were formulated to look for microbial life similar to that found on Earth. Of the four experiments, only the Labeled Release (LR) experiment returned a positive result, showing increased 14CO2 production on first exposure of soil to water and nutrients. All scientists agree on two points from the Viking missions: that radiolabeled 14CO2 was evolved in the Labeled Release experiment, and that the GCMS detected no organic molecules. However, there are vastly different interpretations of <b>what</b> <b>those</b> results imply.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret <b>what</b> <b>those</b> observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E

25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to <b>what</b> <b>those</b> evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

500|$|In his memoirs, Ernst {{said he had}} {{difficulty}} persuading Elisabeth to visit her mother. Before one visit, he found the child [...] "whimpering under a sofa, full of despair." [...] He assured Elisabeth that her mother loved her too. [...] "Mama says she loves me, but you do love me," [...] Elisabeth replied. Margaret Eagar thought the child's eyes were the saddest she had ever seen. [...] "Looking at her I used to wonder <b>what</b> <b>those</b> wide grey-blue eyes saw, to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face," [...] she wrote. Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that [...] "I shall never see this again." [...] However, despite Elisabeth's sad eyes, she was generally a sweet, happy child who was a peacemaker when her cousins had a dispute.|$|E

That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{established}} transition {{headquarters in}} New York, but Agnew was {{not invited to}} meet with him there until November 27, when the two met for an hour. When Agnew spoke to reporters afterwards, he stated that he felt [...] "exhilarated" [...] with his new responsibilities, but did not explain <b>what</b> <b>those</b> were. During the transition period, Agnew traveled extensively, enjoying his new status. He vacationed on St. Croix, where he played a round of golf with Humphrey and Muskie. He went to Memphis for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, and to New York to attend the wedding of Nixon's daughter Julie to David Eisenhower. Agnew was a fan of the Baltimore Colts; in January, he was the guest of team owner Carroll Rosenbloom at Super Bowl III, and watched Joe Namath and the New York Jets upset the Colts, 16–7. There was as yet no official residence for the vice president, and Spiro and Judy Agnew secured a suite at the Sheraton Hotel in Washington formerly occupied by Johnson while vice president. Only one of their children, Kim, the youngest daughter, moved there with them, the others remaining in Maryland.|$|E

500|$|Technical {{accessibility}} and a Do {{it yourself}} (DIY) spirit are prized in punk rock. UK pub rock from 1972-1975 {{contributed to the}} emergence of punk rock by developing a network of small venues, such as pubs, where non-mainstream bands could play. Pub rock also introduced the idea of independent record labels, such as Stiff Records, which put out basic, low-cost records. Pub rock bands organized their own small venue tours and put out small pressings of their records. In the early days of punk rock, this DIY ethic stood in marked contrast to <b>what</b> <b>those</b> in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands. Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was [...] "rock and roll by people who didn't have very many skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music". In December 1976, the English fanzine Sideburns published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned [...] "This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band". The title of a 1980 single by the New York punk band Stimulators, [...] "Loud Fast Rules!", inscribed a catchphrase for punk's basic musical approach.|$|E
500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells us everything he wants us to know about him. The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. These are my roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly <b>what</b> <b>those</b> roots had yielded." ...|$|E
500|$|Preproduction for Deus Ex began around August 1997 {{and lasted}} roughly six months. The six-person team came from Looking Glass's Austin studio. Spector, the team's {{director}} and producer, saw {{their work as}} improving upon the game design ideas of Origin, Looking Glass, and Valve Corporation by doing <b>what</b> <b>those</b> companies did not. The game's [...] "ironic" [...] working title was Shooter: Majestic Revelations, and it was scheduled for release on Christmas 1998. The team developed the setting before the game mechanics. Noticing his wife's fascination with The X-Files, Spector connected the [...] "real world, millennial weirdness, [...] conspiracy" [...] topics on his mind and {{decided to make a}} game about them that would appeal to a wide audience. Shooters fiction was based in part on conspiracy theories related to Area 51, CIA drug trafficking, the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Majestic 12, and a Masonic bunker beneath Denver International Airport. The team designed over 200 characters without associated in-game roles, which was both helpful when designing missions and unhelpful as they attempted to reduce their scope. Later in 1997, Spector wrote a [...] "manifesto" [...] on his ideal game and the structure of role-playing video games. His principles included [...] "problems, not puzzles", [...] "no forced failure", [...] "players do; NPCs watch", and [...] "areas with multiple entrance and exit points". In retrospect, Spector believed that Deus Ex accomplished the intent of his manifesto.|$|E
