25|$|The {{external}} {{design of the}} Class 87 was clearly derived {{from that of the}} Class 86; the only major detail differences were two front cab windows on the 87 instead of the three of the 86, and also the lack of headcode indicator boxes; by 1973, visual recognition of train reporting numbers by signallers was no longer necessary. The power and speed of the Class 87 was increased over that of the Class 86. Power output was increased to 5000hp to deal with the more demanding gradients on the northern half of the WCML such as Shap Fell and Beattock Summit, and the top speed was raised to 110mph (180km/h). The 87s were also fitted with multiple <b>working</b> <b>equipment</b> which enabled locomotives to work {{with other members of the}} class (and some Class 86s) while controlled by one driver.|$|E
500|$|Originally TOPS {{numbered}} from 47001 to 47298, these locomotives {{were the}} [...] "basic" [...] Class 47 with steam heating equipment fitted. [...] In the 1970s and 1980s, with steam heating of trains gradually being phased out, all locomotives fitted {{with the equipment}} gradually had their steam heating boilers removed. [...] Some were fitted with ETH and became 47/4s, whilst the others remained with no train heating capability and were therefore used mainly on freight work. [...] In the 1990s, the class designation 47/2 was applied to some class 47/0s and class 47/3s after they were fitted with multiple <b>working</b> <b>equipment.</b> [...] The locomotives involved also had their vacuum braking systems removed or isolated, leaving them air braked only. This was mainly a paper exercise, however, and the locomotives were not renumbered; in this article they are included in Class 47/0.|$|E
500|$|The post quartermaster, Captain Thomas Swords, was {{in charge}} of {{building}} Fort Scott's structures, and {{had to deal with the}} problems of construction on the Kansas prairie, which had few trees. [...] He had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. [...] Wood was available, but the mill was built [...] away, making transport time consuming. [...] Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and <b>working</b> <b>equipment.</b> [...] Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort's construction. [...] As a result, only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters (four duplexes and post commandant's house) was built by 1844, and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed. [...] In his 1844 inspection of the fort, Colonel George Croghan reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott [...] "above average".|$|E

2500|$|Debate {{continues}} {{over the}} distinction between [...] "commodity" [...] and [...] "waste" [...] electronics definitions. Some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficult-to-recycle, obsolete, or non-repairable equipment mixed in loads of <b>working</b> <b>equipment</b> (though this may also come through ignorance, or to avoid more costly treatment processes). [...] Protectionists may broaden the definition of [...] "waste" [...] electronics {{in order to protect}} domestic markets from working secondary equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Special {{forms of}} dress for prostitutes and courtesans were {{introduced}} in the 13th century: in Marseilles a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on. [...] Over time, these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm. [...] Later restrictions specified various forms of finery that were forbidden, although there was also sometimes a recognition that finery represented <b>working</b> <b>equipment</b> (and capital) for a prostitute, {{and they could be}} exempted from laws applying to other non-noble women. [...] By the 15th century, no compulsory clothing seems to have been imposed on prostitutes in Florence, Venice (the European capital of courtesans) or Paris.|$|E
2500|$|The late 1960s saw a brief {{revival in}} the {{fortunes}} of the D800s. For a few months in late 1967 they moved on to the Paddington–Birmingham New Street route and then in early 1968 Paddington–Hereford. Rising traffic levels on the Paddington–Plymouth route meant the WR aspired to an hourly service interval for this route with standard 10 and 12 carriage trains. The maximum schedule was to be 4hours 15minutes for the , but the [...] "Cornish Riviera Express" [...] would be retimed for 3hours 45minutes with stops at Taunton and Exeter only. The Class 52 Westerns could only cope with these timings on seven carriage trains. The answer was to assemble pairs of D800s and reinstate the multiple <b>working</b> <b>equipment</b> on them, to allow the pair to be controlled by one driver. This was done with D819/22–24/27–29/31/32 and D866–69 and the acceleration in schedules did bring a further 7% increase in traffic levels. It was not, however, without its problems: a fault on one locomotive in a multiple-unit pair effectively disabled both and one alone could not keep to the schedules. By 1969 only two services were booked for a pair of D800s, albeit losing a further 15minutes off the schedule, and the timetable was largely recast into separate Torbay and Plymouth trains, instead of being split en route. This allowed the formations to revert to eight or nine carriages that a single Western could handle alone.|$|E

Data collection by audiometric  measurement, tension before and after working measurement also noise in working environment measurement. Univariat analysis, bivariat analysis. With chi-square test are used to analyzed the data. The results of the study showed that there was not significant affect of noise to hearing function (sig. α = 0, 401 > 0, 05), but there was significant affect of noise to sistole blood pressure (sig. α = 0, 039 < 0, 05) and diastole blood pressure (sig. α = 0, 019 < 0, 05). Suggestion for the company are necessary noise measurement in all working company area, maintenance activity must be done for periodically and all of broken equipment must be replaced, audiometric measurement every ones in a year, blood pressure measurement must be controlled, Safety sign compatible as safety and health risk, prepared APD like ear muff, training  and socialized about noise affect to the health and how to control them...|$|R
