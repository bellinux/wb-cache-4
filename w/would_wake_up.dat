5|$|Skelton was a {{prolific}} writer of both {{short stories and}} music. After sleeping only {{four or five hours}} a night, he <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> at 5a.m. and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies by the time of his death. He wrote commercials for Skoal tobacco and sold many of his compositions to Muzak, a company that specialized in providing background music to stores and other businesses. Skelton was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated bonsai trees at his home in Palm Springs, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship and admiration. Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to bed. The disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E

25|$|The last {{communication}} with the rover was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010) {{and there is a}} strong possibility the rover’s batteries lost so much energy at some point that the mission clock stopped. In previous winters the rover was able to park on a Sun-facing slope and keep its internal temperature above −40°C, but since the rover was stuck on flat ground it is estimated that its internal temperature dropped to −55°C. If Spirit had survived these conditions and there had been a cleaning event, there was a possibility that with the southern summer solstice in March 2011, solar energy would increase to a level that <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> the rover.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

500|$|The Just So Stories {{began as}} bedtime stories told to his {{daughter}} [...] "Effie" [...] when the first three were published in a children’s magazine, a year before her death, Kipling explained: [...] "in the evening there were stories meant to put Effie to sleep, and you {{were not allowed to}} alter those by one single little word. They had to be told just so; or Effie <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> and put back the missing sentence. So at last they came to be like charms, all three of them,—the whale tale, the camel tale, and the rhinoceros tale." ...|$|E
500|$|After the battle, {{the soul}} of the zduhać would return into his body, and he <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> weak and exhausted. If he was wounded, he would be sick for some time afterwards—before he recovered, or died if his wound was mortal. There are records of seriously ill men who claimed that they were wounded in zduhać battles. It was held in Montenegrin Littoral that a mortally wounded zduhać could still recuperate if he revenged himself on his wounder before the eighth day of his wound expired.

60|$|My dog knew as {{well when}} she was on the turn as I did. Before she broke out, he would give a howl, and bolt.

At such times I wished I was him.|$|R

500|$|... "Tik Tok" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha, {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and was co-produced by Luke and Blanco.

She would then write down {{a few words to}} a song, then the following morning she <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> with the story waiting to be told. The opening line came from an experience where she woke up surrounded by [...] "beautiful women", leading to her imagining P. Diddy being in a similar scenario. She then proceeded to bring the song to her producer Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and the song was written. Four hours later, Diddy called Luke and said that they should do a song together. Diddy came to the studio later that day to contribute his lines and the collaboration was completed.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Helmut F. Landsberg, {{a climate}} {{scientist}} {{with the federal}} Weather Bureau, predicted in 1963 that the Northeastern and Great Lakes regions could anticipate a major smog event every three years due to the confluence of weather events and trends like growing population, industrialization, and increased emissions from cars and central heating. In early 1966, Dr. Walter Orr Roberts—director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research—warned of the imminent threat of a smog event {{with the potential to}} kill as many as 10,000 people. Roberts identified Los Angeles or New York City as the cities most vulnerable to a large-scale lethal smog in the United States, and London, Hamburg, or Santiago as other the most vulnerable internationally. Asked if [...] "many" [...] American cities were vulnerable to a disaster smog event, Roberts replied, [...] "Yes. I have been worried that we <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> some morning to an unusual meteorological situation that prevented the air from circulating and that we might find thousands of people dead {{as the result of the}} air they were forced to breathe in that smog situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} preceded by a single, [...] "The Box", {{starring}} the actress Tilda Swinton in the singles video.
