5|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come by in the morning and Stuart <b>would</b> <b>answer</b> the door in his stocking feet– as he'd been up all night. I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had been seeking to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years reassembling the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, after breakfast, the family and guests would all gather in the drawing room, which was the only large room in the house, and Granville <b>would</b> <b>answer</b> government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E

Armstrong seems to have been tolerant towards various religions, but also found humor in them.|$|E
