This student had written a master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis of questionable merit, and we had rejected it in 1975 and had demanded a complete rewrite.

60|$|Now {{you must}} {{bear in mind}} that these Pharisees were not villains and profligates. Many people, feeling, perhaps, how much of what the Lord had said against the Pharisees would apply to them, have tried to escape from that ugly thought, by making out the Pharisees worse men than our Lord does. But the fact is, that they cannot be proved to be worse than too many {{religious}} people now-a-days. There were adulterers, secret loose-livers among them. Are there none now-a- days? They were covetous. Are no religious professors covetous now-a-days? They crept into widows' houses, and, for a pretence made long prayers. Does no one do so now? There would, of course, be among them, as there is among all large religious parties, as there is now, a great deal of inconsistent and bad conduct. But, on the whole, {{there is no reason to}} suppose that the greater number of them were what we should call ill-livers. In that terrible twenty- third chapter of St. Matthew, in which our Lord denounces the sins of the Scribes and Pharisees, he nowhere accuses them of profligate living; and the Pharisee of whom he tells us in his parable, who went into the Temple to pray, no doubt spoke truth when he boasted of not being as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers. He trusted in himself that he was righteous. True. But whatever that means, it means that he thought that he was righteous, after a fashion, though it proved to be a wrong one. What our Lord complains of in them is, first, their hardness of heart; their pride in themselves, and their contempt for their fellowmen. Their very name Pharisee meant that. It meant separate--they were separate from mankind; a peculiar people; who alone knew the law, with whom alone God was pleased: while the rest of mankind, even of their own countrymen, knew not the law, and were accursed, and doomed to hell. Ah God, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>to</b> cast stones at the Pharisees of old, when this is the very thing which you may hear said in England from hundreds of pulpits every Sunday, with the mere difference, that instead of the word law, men put the word gospel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Many major {{philosophers}} in {{the past}} have dealt with the question of the meaning of life, and the question has received renewed attention in the last decades. A common feature of all recent approaches, however, seems to be that none of them takes into account the relevance of knowledge {{to the question of the}} meaning of life. The main aim of this paper is to deal with this question. From Aristotle to Russell it has been widely held that knowledge is the ultimate purpose and meaning of life. In this paper I argue that this view is inadequate, because our life has no ultimate purpose or meaning from an outside or higher viewpoint, but only from an internal viewpoint. Its ultimate purpose and meaning is, as Aristotle states, happiness, which however, unlike what Aristotle claims, does not consist in knowledge. On the other hand, this does not mean the knowledge is irrelevant to happiness, on the contrary, in a sense it is a precondition for it. For it is through knowledge that life, from the first unicellular organisms to humans, has been able to exist and to preserve itself. Moreover, an essential condition for a happy life <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>we,</b> and <b>to</b> a large extent <b>we</b> <b>are</b> what <b>we</b> know. Furthermore, lack of knowledge generates prejudice and superstition, which have negative consequences even from a biological viewpoint...|$|R
