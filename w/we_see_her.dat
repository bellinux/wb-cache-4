5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{in a red}} dress moving across a screen of {{multiple}} changing colors and then moves to multiple shots of Elliott rapping in a white and red jersey and matching hat, Lyte in a blue dress, and a church choir group. Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. Shots are shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a party with a guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a room in a golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song then moves to a verse by Mc Lyte and <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> dancing {{in the middle of a}} semi-circle of men wearing orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E
25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|The play's [...] "greatest charm is the {{character}} of Imogen", writes Hazlitt. He observes how, in justifying her actions, [...] "she relies little on her personal charms" [...] or a prudish [...] "affected antipathy to vice" [...] but rather [...] "on her merit, and her merit is in the depth of her love, her truth and constancy." [...] Shakespeare's presentation is full and rounded. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> beauty as observed by others (as by the villain Iachimo), but more often <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> from the inside, and are touched when, after endless nights of crying herself awake {{over the loss of}} Posthumus, she is outraged to learn (as she is falsely informed) that Some Jay of Italy [...] hath betrayed him. And we witness a moment in the development of her character, as her resolve to disguise herself to seek out Posthumus grows firmer. [...] "Of all Shakespear's women she is perhaps the most tender and most artless." ...|$|E

500|$|Ling is {{not above}} using her {{ethnicity}} {{as a means}} of gaining advantage. [...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Henstridge {{described}} the episode as [...] "a coming-of-age story. I think we see Simmons at the start, and she’s {{never really been}} combat ready ... <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> have to survive, and just to see her go on this journey from complete despair". Henstridge also noted thriller elements in the episode. On the moment in [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] where Simmons loses hope, Henstridge explained, [...] "I never thought we'd see her get to that place ... It justifies her relationship with Will, too, because {{she was ready to}} end it all and {{he was the one who}} pulled her back from the brink." [...] Concerning that relationship with new character Will Daniels, the executive producers worked with Titley to try to make it feel earned in the episode, given the fan following of 'FitzSimmons' (the potential relationship between Simmons and Leo Fitz). Executive producer Jed Whedon also noted on this that the episode [...] "wasn’t a story about the two of them on this planet, but a story about Fitz hearing this and how he will respond. He breaks your heart, at the end, she breaks your heart, and hopefully, you’re feeling for all three involved." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was given}} a {{positive}} reception by many critics of the show. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly both considered {{it to be an}} improvement from the previous episode. Futterman wrote that it [...] "gave us the charm, wit and just-zany-enough-to-be-plausible plot lines we were sorely missing after last week's predictable" [...] episode, and added, [...] "Even better: the episode didn't feel as long as the 90 minutes it clocked in at." [...] IGN Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10. While he said the episode was entertaining, he felt that it {{did not need to be}} an hour and a half. Emily Yahr of The Washington Post agreed about the extended length, and did not like what she called [...] "lame attempts to fill time", which she said [...] "detracted from what started as a decent episode". She did, however, cite several [...] "promising storylines", including Rachel's, and noted, [...] "Usually, New Directions leader Rachel Berry is a caricature of all things annoying—but this episode, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> genuinely struggling with wanting to love herself the way she is". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson summed it up as follows: [...] "Not an epic episode, just sort of … meh." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times reacted more positively and wrote, [...] "The 90-minute episode had a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, some good lessons, character development, a few good numbers and more than a few surprises." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{published}} synopsis in The Nickelodeon {{reads as}} follows, [...] "The night before Christmas, Alice, {{a child of}} wealth, after going through the usual form of hanging up her stocking, is put to bed by her maid. Alice falls asleep and dreams. Enter Santa Claus and Gnomes who tell Alice to follow her and they will show her part of their Funnyland. Alice follows the little people under the special protection of a policeman two foot high. The little party are seen trotting through beautiful glens and dales until they reach Funnyland. Santa Claus tells {{her that if she}} is a good girl all the animals and toys here are hers; as Alice touches each one they come to life. The teddy bear steps out to dance with Alice. As Alice removes the cover from Doll's box the doll dances out, a little king gives a magical entertainment, a clown is very active and all the animals and dolls do some interesting act much to the surprise and delight of little Alice. At last, tired out, Alice falls asleep reclining upon the shoulders of Teddy bear. Then <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> again back in her own little bed. It is now Christmas morning. Her maid awakens and dresses her for the great event, takes her to the drawing room where she is welcomed by her parents to find that her dream has come true." [...] Originally the film was billed as being released for December 19, 1910 and then it was later claimed to be December 26, 1910. This release was attributed in an issue of The Nickelodeon. However, the film was not released on December 19 because an advertisement in Moving Picture World in January 1911 said that the release would be delayed for a [...] "few days". It is unknown, and unlikely, if the film actually was released because no other publications, ads or materials surrounding the Gnome Motion Picture Company followed.|$|E
2500|$|Anna is sexy, sultry and curvy, wearing stylish outfits in matches. Before the fight, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> flirting and teasing the enemy, {{and then}} to ridicule meeting ended with a coarse laugh and provocative moves; for her {{attitude}} and way of clothing {{can be considered as}} a [...] flapper [...] as well as a [...] femme fatale [...] character. Usually, she's shown wearing a modified silk qipao/cheongsam with floral pantyhose along with matching gloves and shoes, often high heels, and she keeps her hair well-coiffed and cut to the neckline. She is also seen a few times wearing a zebra printed jumpsuit with a matching zebra printed hat, a necklace, black gloves, and black heels. She is often among the few characters who are given a third outfit option, as opposed to the standard two. In Death by Degrees, Anna is wearing a more Nina-style high-tech combat outfit and has a different haircut. Her look was revamped once more for Tekken Tag Tournament 2. She is 18 in the first Tekken, 20 in Tekken 2, and 41 in Tekken 6; although she is in her 40s, cryosleep effects preserved her physical abilities of her 20s.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{television}} {{adaptation of the}} play was in 1960 when the BBC produced a serial entitled An Age of Kings. The show comprised fifteen sixty- and seventy-five-minute episodes which adapted all eight of Shakespeare's sequential history plays. Directed by Michael Hayes and produced by Peter Dews, with a script by Eric Crozier, the production featured Terry Scully as Henry, Mary Morris as Margaret, Julian Glover as Edward and Paul Daneman as Richard. The twelfth episode, [...] covers Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scenes 1 and 2, concluding with Richard's soliloquy wherein he vows to attain the crown. The thirteenth episode, , presents everything from Act 3, Scene 3 onwards, beginning with Margaret's visit to Louis XI in France. With each episode running one hour, {{a great deal of}} text was necessarily removed, but aside from truncation, only minor alterations were made to the original. For example, in [...] "The Morning's War", the character of Edmund, Earl of Rutland is played by an adult actor, whereas in the text, he is a child and Margaret is present during the murder of Rutland, and <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> wipe his blood on the handkerschief which she later gives to York. Additionally, Richard fights and kills Clifford during the Battle of [...] Towton. In the text, they fight, but Clifford flees and is mortally wounded off-stage when hit by an arrow. In [...] "The Sun in Splendour", Edward is rescued from his imprisonment by Richard and Lord Stafford, whereas in the play, he is rescued by Richard, Lord Hastings and William Stanley. Also, the end of the episode differs slightly {{from the end of the}} play. After Edward [...] expresses his wish that all conflict has ceased, a large celebration ensues. As the credits role, Richard and George stand to one side, and George almost slips into a barrel of wine, only to be saved by Richard. As George walks away, Richard thinks to himself and then smiles deviously at the camera.|$|E
