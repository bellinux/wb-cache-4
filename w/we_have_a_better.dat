5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{understanding}} of the signal transduction that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. Jasmonic acid is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to wild type plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which activates the H+ ATPase inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E

There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts {{that can be used}} to preserve our valuable marshes and put them back to their original state.|$|E

2500|$|Quantrill {{then joined}} {{a group of}} Missouri ruffians and became {{somewhat}} of a drifter. The group helped protect Missouri farmers from the Jayhawkers for pay and slept wherever they could find lodging. Quantrill traveled back to Utah and then to Colorado, but returned {{in less than a}} year to Lawrence, Kansas, in 1859. It was at this time that he began to formulate his political views, especially those regarding slavery. Initially, before 1860, Quantrill appeared to support the anti-slavery side. For instance, he wrote to his good friend W.W. Scott in January 1858 that the Lecompton Constitution was a [...] "swindle" [...] and that James H. Lane, a Northern sympathizer, was [...] "as good a man as we have here." [...] He also called the Democrats [...] "the worst men we have for they are all rascals, for no one can be a democrat here without being one." [...] However, in February 1860, Quantrill wrote a letter to his mother expressing his views on the anti-slavery supporters. He told her the pro-slavery movement was right and that he now detested Jim Lane. He said that the hanging of John Brown had been too good for him and that, [...] "the devil has got unlimited sway over this territory, and will hold it until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> set of man and society generally." ...|$|E

In ice {{or water}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{conductor}} than spermaceti, and the phenomena of induction and insulation therefore rapidly disappear, because conduction quickly follows upon {{the assumption of}} the inductive state. But let a plate of cold ice have metallic coatings on its sides, and connect one of these with a good electrical machine in work, {{and the other with}} the ground, and it then becomes easy to observe the phenomena of induction through the ice, by the electrical tension which can be obtained and continued on both the coatings (419. 426.). For although that portion of power which at one moment gave the inductive condition to the particles is at the next lowered by the consequent discharge due to the conductive act, it is succeeded by another portion of force from the machine to restore the inductive state. If the ice be converted into water the same succession of actions can be just as easily proved, provided the water be distilled, and (if the machine be not powerful enough) a voltaic battery be employed.|$|E

60|$|In the {{progress}} of geological speculation, the same laws of thought are displayed. We have dogmas that were more than half false, passing current for a time as universal truths. We have evidence collected in proof of these dogmas; by and by a colligation of facts in antagonism with them; and eventually a consequent modification. In conformity with this improved hypothesis, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> classification of facts; a greater power of arranging and interpreting the new facts now rapidly gathered together; and further resulting corrections of hypothesis. Being, as we are at present, {{in the midst of}} this process, it is not possible to give an adequate account of the development of geological science as thus regarded: the earlier stages are alone known to us. Not only, however, is it interesting to observe how the more advanced views now received respecting the Earth's history, have been evolved out of the crude views which preceded them; but we shall find it extremely instructive to observe this. We shall see how greatly the old ideas still sway both the general mind and the minds of geologists themselves. We shall see how the kind of evidence that has in part abolished these old ideas, is still daily accumulating, and threatens to make other like revolutions. In brief, we shall see whereabouts we are in the elaboration of a true theory of the Earth; and, seeing our whereabouts, shall be the better able to judge, among various conflicting opinions, which best conform to the ascertained direction of geological discovery.|$|E

6000|$|But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{means of}} getting this substance, and in greater quantity, {{so as to}} {{ascertain}} what its general characters are. We find this substance in very great abundance in a multitude of cases where you would least expect it. All limestones contain {{a great deal of}} this gas which issues from the candle, and which we call carbonic acid. All chalks, all shells, all corals contain a great quantity of this curious air. We find it fixed in these stones; for which reason Dr. Black called it [...] "fixed air"--finding it in these fixed things like marble and chalk. He called it fixed air, because it lost its quality of air, and assumed the condition of a solid body. We can easily get this air from marble. Here is a jar containing a little muriatic acid, and here is a taper which, if I put it into that jar, will shew only the presence of common air. There is, you see, pure air down to the bottom; the jar is full of it Here is a substance--marble[17], a very beautiful and superior marble--and if I put these pieces of marble into the jar, a great boiling apparently goes on. That, however, is not steam--it is a gas that is rising up; and if I now search the jar by a candle, I shall have exactly the same effect produced upon the taper as I had from the air which issued {{from the end of the}} chimney over the burning candle. It is exactly the same action, and caused by the very same substance that issued from the candle; and in this way we can get carbonic acid in great abundance--we have already nearly filled the jar. We also find that this gas is not merely contained in marble. Here is a vessel in which I have put some common whitening--chalk, which has been washed in water and deprived of its coarser particles, and so supplied to the plasterer as whitening. Here is a large jar containing this whitening and water, and I have here some strong sulphuric acid, which is the acid you might have to use if you were to make these experiments (only, in using this acid with limestone, the body that is produced is an insoluble substance, whereas the muriatic acid produces a soluble substance that does not so much thicken the water). And you will seek out a reason why I take this kind of apparatus for the purpose of shewing this experiment. I do it because you may repeat in a small way what I am about to do in a large one. You will have here just the same kind of action; and I am evolving in this large jar carbonic acid, exactly the same in its nature and properties as the gas which we obtained from the combustion of the candle in the atmosphere. And no matter how different the two methods by which we prepare this carbonic acid, you will see, when we get to the end of our subject, that it is all exactly the same, whether prepared in the one way or in the other.|$|E
