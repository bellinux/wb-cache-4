5|$|In 1992, theatre {{director}} Peter Sellars {{released his}} only feature film, The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez, an experimental film {{loosely based on}} Caligari. However, the storyline was created as the film <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made,</b> so it has few similarities with the original film. The film was screened only at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and never theatrically released.|$|E

The Nintendo 3DS version was eventually released in Japan on October 12, 2016, courtesy of Japanese publisher Pikii.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh {{were also}} early adopters of {{roasting}} cheese. An early incarnation of Welsh rarebit <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> in medieval times, {{and by the}} middle of the 15th century Rarebit was considered a national dish. The acid soil of Wales meant that the milk produced by their cattle created a soft cheese, which was not as good for roasting, so Welsh people would trade for harder cheeses such as Cheddar.|$|E

5|$|The grape was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC {{between the}} Black Sea and Persia; archaeological {{evidence}} shows that wine <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> there by 6,000 BC, reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC. Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC, and in France around 600 BC.|$|E

She was also awarded honorary doctorates by the Universities of Essex and Bristol, and the award of a Chevalier de l'Ordre du Mérite Agricole. In 1976 she was {{appointed}} as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and promoted to Commander of the Order (CBE) in 1986. The honour that most pleased her, however, <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1982 {{in recognition of}} her skills as a writer.|$|E
5|$|This ending was the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative ending was the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative ending was rejected and the writers favoured the ending that was eventually broadcast. It is believed that the alternative ending would have been broadcast if a third series <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made,</b> as that ending was much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still has something to say.|$|E

5|$|War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley {{reported}} to Congress that efforts at diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress declared war. By this time, McKinley {{had begun to}} rely on Assistant Secretary of State William R. Day for day-to-day management of the State Department, and was even inviting him to cabinet meetings, as Sherman had stopped attending them. Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as the real power in the State Department. Sherman, sensing that he <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.|$|E
5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made.</b> They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{widespread}} damage, 1,000personnel from the Canadian military were brought in for recovery efforts. The military operation, known as Operation Lama, was to last {{for the duration of}} the emergency phase in the immediate aftermath. An initial deployment of 120soldiers and 40vehicles arrived on September25 from the Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in Oromocto, New Brunswick arrived in Newfoundland. Three ships and a fleet of helicopters were called in for the distribution of emergency aid and the military set up temporary bridges while long-term plans for reconstruction were made. Operation Lama also enabled partial repairs of several buildings, and simultaneously, emergency personnel surveyed roughly 500mi (900km) of roads in Newfoundland. On September27, government officials stated that it would take months for cleanup efforts to finish. Ten days after the storm, six towns were still isolated as progress on temporary road reconstruction <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made</b> only slowly. Allocation of military aid continued through October6, though the number of on-scene personnel began to decrease two days earlier.|$|E

5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made.</b> A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E
5|$|With costs {{much higher}} than anticipated, work ceased in June 1811. After much deliberation, {{it was decided to}} {{continue}} construction, and to obtain a third Act of Parliament to authorise increased charges for carriage of goods. By 1812, progress <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made,</b> but was hampered by the need for rock cuttings at Holcombe Rogus. Leakage also meant that some sections needed to be lined with puddle clay. Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials, which can still be seen beside the canal, close to the Waytown Tunnel. Fenacre Bridge and Fossend Bridge were constructed at Burlescombe, where culverts were also needed to manage the streams. At a total cost of £244,505, the canal was opened on 25 August 1814, when the first boat travelled from Lowdwells to Tiverton, laden with coal.|$|E
5|$|After a month {{engaged in}} {{reorganisation}} and training at Sidi Azeiz, the New Zealanders re-entered {{the campaign in}} mid-December at El Agheila {{in an attempt to}} trap the Panzer Army Africa. On 11 December, the division carried out a flanking move to the south and west, led by the 6th Brigade with the 25th Battalion on the right of the advance. The move was unopposed for five days until the evening of 15 December, when a reconnaissance element that included the brigade's commander, Brigadier William Gentry, came under fire from a ridge. The 25th Battalion supported the 24th Battalion's subsequent attack on the ridge but {{it was found that the}} trap had failed, with the Germans slipping through the gap between the 5th and 6th Brigades. A second attempt to trap the Germans was made at Nofilia a few days later but this also failed when the rearguard prevented the 5th Brigade from closing the road along which the retreat <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>made.</b> The advance continued and on 23 January 1943, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered Tripoli. Shortly after reaching the city, Bonifant was given command of the New Zealand Divisional Cavalry with Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Morten taking over the 25th Battalion. Initially stationed outside of Tripoli, it moved into the city proper later in February with the rest of the 6th Brigade as part of the occupying force.|$|E
