40|$|Specimens {{from three}} pork {{producers}} {{were subjected to}} comparative investigations of slaughter pig, carcass and pork quality to characterise the quality of pork as a product. The starting materials used were eight genotypes bred and slaughtered un-der standardised conditions in the Land of Brandenburg. The following populations were tested: L x L; L x E; L x Du; L x Pi; L/E x Pi; E x Ha/Pi; S x S, and S x E. Data and specimen materials (M. long. dorsi) were studied {{for a total of}} 461 animals or carcasses considered suitable for the investigation. Data of official meat inspection, as well as carcass <b>warm</b> <b>weight,</b> muscle and backfat thickness (Fat-O-Meater) were considered for evaluation. The pork quality was tested 45 min p. m. assessing the criteria of pH 1 and Lf 1. Moreover pH 2, water-retention capacity (Beutling´s direct me-thod), remission (Spekol) and intramuscular fat content (Weibull/Stoldt disintegration method; Soxhlet fat extraction) were determined 24 hours p. m [...] Own studies revealed an affected respiratory system in 10 to 25 percent depen-ding on the producers. For conventional keeping with adequate range to move, endoparasitic invasion was found to be 38 percent. Evaluation of the overall material showed that, as the carcass <b>warm</b> <b>weight</b> in-creased, the thickness of backfat grew as well (r = 0. 42 *). For the populations of L x Du (r = 0. 61 *), L x Pi (r = 0. 69 *) and L/E x Pi (r = 0. 68 *), this correlation was en-hanced. For the overall material, the average amount of muscle determined was 54 per-cent and the backfat thickness averaged 18 mm. The L x Du population having a mean carcass <b>warm</b> <b>weight</b> of 96 kg and 54 percent muscle exhibited good or even very good results. The saddle-back populations achieved 45 percent mu-scle, with mean backfat thickness ranging from 27 to 29 mm. The antagonism of criteria, i. e. between backfat thickness and amount of muscle, was confirmed in particular for the Pietrain cross-breeds (r = 0. 90 *). For all other criteria studied and relating to the quality of carcasses, statistically significant differences were found {{as a function of the}} sex of the slaughter pigs. For the overall material, the mean pH 1 of 6. 41 and grading into the classes of "PSE" and "suspected PSE" each being as low as 4 percent yielded a good level. The L x Pi and L/E x Pi populations exhibited a proportion of 7 and 13 percent, re-spectively. The pH 1 measurement provided a high degree of certainty in assessing the quality of pork. The unbiasedness achieved was greater than that seen with Lf 1 measu-rements. Variations in pH 1 must be checked 24 hours p. m. In collecting the pH 2 data, the mean value determined for the overall material was 5. 61. A markedly high percentage of grading into the "PSE" class was noted for the saddle-back pig populations, being greater than 50 percent. For the material of the E x Ha/Pi population studied, the occurrence of the "Hampshire effect" was confirmed on the grounds of clearly low pH 2 values. Studying the water-retention capacity of pork for the overall material revealed a mean of 0. 26 mL/g, a finding within the normal range. An elevated proportion of "PSE pork" amounting to 7 percent was found for the L x Pi cross-breed. Very high proportions in the "PSE" range were noted for the S x S and the S x E popu-lations, being 19 and 27 percent, respectively. The remission levels for the overall material yielded a mean of 18. 08 percent, a finding within the normal range. The highest proportion in the "PSE" class was seen for the L x Du population being 5 percent, and in the "DFD" class the highest proportion was noted for the L x L breed which amounted to 7 percent. For the intramuscular fat content, the mean value of the overall material was 1. 71 percent, thus being less than the specified normal level of 2. 0 percent. In overall comparison, the heterogeneity for the markedness of this criterion was reflected by the means seen for the Pietrain cross-breeds in the area of 1. 50 percent. In contrast, the S x S; S x E, and L X Du populations attained levels above 2. 0 per-cent. The best quality finding in respect of marbling and amount of muscle was obtained for the L x Du population. Referring to the demands on product quality, the saddle-back pig populations have to be considered separately. With a view to quality meat schemes and quality assurance systems, the popula-tions studied offer a sound basis such that consumer demands and market requi-rements can be met by increasingly targeted approaches.

40|$|Many {{sweet corn}} hybrids {{germinate}} poorly and have low seedling vigor in cold soils. Sources of cold tolerance {{and an understanding}} of its inheritance would benefit sweet corn production. Our objective was to determine the genetics of cold tolerance among open-pollinated progenitors of modern sweet corn. Six open-pollinated sweet corn cultivars were used as parents of a diallel. The 15 crosses plus reciprocals, parents, and checks were evaluated in cold chambers. Growing conditions were 14 hours with light at 14 °C, and 10 hours without light at 10 °C. Days to emergence, percent emergence, shoot dry weight, and root dry weight were recorded. The experiment was repeated in the greenhouse under warm conditions. Variation for cold tolerance was present among the crosses and cultivars. The variation was primarily due to general combining ability (GCA) effects, with specific combining ability (SCA) effects and reciprocal effects being significant for seedling dry mater. `Howling Mob' had significant favorable GCAs for all cold tolerance traits and resulted in the most cold-tolerant hybrids. `Country Gentleman' and `Stowell's Evergreen' were the slowest emerging parents. Days to emergence under cold conditions was not correlated to days to emergence under warm conditions. The correlations between root weight (cold) and root <b>weight</b> (<b>warm)</b> and shoot <b>weight</b> (cold) and shoot <b>weight</b> (<b>warm)</b> were significant, positive, and relatively large.

BOHUSLÁVEK Czech University of Agriculture in Prague, Technical faculty, Czech Republic ABSTRACT: Using a device (based on a 4 -electrode method) for measuring the values of biological tissue impedance at 2 and 120 kHz, the impedance of 293 beef carcasses was identified during the current operation of a high-performance, modern abattoir line. An adapter with variable distance of needle electrodes and a computer-controlled measuring process enabled a fast impedance scanning process. The values recorded by measurements (impedance – imp 2, 120 (kHz); <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight</b> – CW; distance of measuring electrodes – D) and the values subsequently derived were estimated as inde-pendent variables, and subsequently their correlation to the estimated commercial classification values (conformation, fatness) was ascertained. The measurements revealed a relationship (r = 0. 8) between conformation and impedance at the frequency of 120 kHz; and a high correlation between “electric volume ” (D 2 /imp 120) at the frequency of 120 kHz and the <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight</b> (CW), expressed by the correlation coefficient r = 0. 827. Using a stepwise regression analysis, regression formulas for conformation estimation were sought for, and the best model with the coefficient of correlation/ determination (r = 0. 867 /r 2 = 0. 752) was found for the following independent variables: imp 2, D 2 /imp 120, CW and D.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{genotype}} and slaughter age on gonadal development, body {{development and the}} correlations between these measurements were studied in five pig genotypes (Genotype 1, Genotype 2, Genotype 3, Genotype 4 and Genotype 5) consisting of 112 gilts and 112 boars with initial live weights varying between 25 – 30 kg. The pigs were group-housed in commercial type grower houses and fed a diet consisting of 14 MJ/kg energy, 18 % CP and 1. 1 % lysine during the growth period up to a live weight of 65 kg, followed by a diet consisting 13. 5 MJ/kg, 16 % CP and 0. 9 % lysine from 65 kg to 90 kg and then a diet consisting of 13. 2 MJ/kg, 15 % CP and 0. 7 % lysine from 90 kg onwards. Pigs were slaughtered at 116, 130, 144, 158, 172, 186, 200 and 214 days of age. Gonadal growth and development were measured in gilts (ovary length, ovary width, ovary thickness, ovary weight, ovary volume, follicle number, {{and size of the}} largest follicle), boars (testis length, testis width, testis weight and testis volume) and body development parameters (slaughter <b>weight,</b> <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight,</b> carcass length, chest depth, dressing percentage and P 2 backfat thickness) were compared. Differences between means were tested using breed, sex and slaughter age as fixed effects, while the relationships between gonadal and body development parameters were evaluated by means of correlation analysis. Genotype 5 had a significantly shorter ovary length than Genotype 4 and Genotype 2. Genotype 2 gilts also had heavier ovaries and larger ovary volumes than Genotype 5 gilts. In boars, Genotype 2 had significantly heavier testes weights than Genotype 5 boars. Genotype 5 boars also tended to have smaller testis volumes than Genotype 2 boars. In body development, Genotype 2 gilts and boars were superior to the Genotype 5 in terms of slaughter and <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weights,</b> while Genotype 3 seconded Genotype 2. The average P 2 backfat thicknesses were 11. 88 mm and 13. 68 mm for boars and gilts respectively. Correlations between gonadal and body development parameters were low to moderate in the gilts (r = - 0. 305 to 0. 555) and moderate to high in boars (r = 0. 560 to 0. 871). However, dressing percentage, follicle number and size of the largest follicle correlated poorly with all other measurements. It is concluded from the study that although Genotype 5 do not grow to the same size and at the same rate compared to the other genotypes, they appear to be the most suitable for the production of top quality pork in terms of its low backfat thickness. Genotype 5 pigs were also characterized with a slower gonadal growth and body development compared to Genotype 2 pigs. Results from this study suggest that selecting against backfat may delay gonadal development and sexual maturation in pigs.

A {{brief history of}} the dairy industry in Ghana is provided. Traits reviewed for the breeds, maintained in the coastal savannah zone and humid forest zone, include milk production, reproduction, calf growth, carcass parameters and adaptive traits. Even though exotic dairy breeds initially had higher milk production in Ghana than the indigenous breeds, none of the exotic breed programmes could be sustained. Both additive and heterotic effects were important in improving lactation traits in the GSH. Crossbreeding improved reproductive traits. Total heritability figures for birth and weaning weights indicated that selection would be effective in improving the two traits. Carcass parameters showed that crossing Red Poll or Santa Gertrudis with N’Dama improved weight at slaughter and <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight.</b> Heat tolerance trials and mortality data indicated that while the Sokoto Gudali was the most adapted to heat stress, crossbred animals were better adapted than Holstein–Friesians in the hot humid coastal savannah zone.

40|$|European forests have a {{prominent}} role in the global carbon cycle and an increase in carbon storage has been consistently reported during the 20 th century. Any further increase in forest carbon storage, however, could be hampered by increases in aridity and extreme climatic events. Here we use forest inventory data to identify the relative importance of stand structure (stand basal area and mean d. b. h.), mean climate (water availability) and recent climate change (temperature and precipitation anomalies) on forest basal area change during the late 20 th century in three major European biomes. Using linear mixed-effects models we observed that stand structure, mean climate and recent climatic change strongly interact to modulate basal area change. Although we observed a net increment in stand basal area during the late 20 th century, we found the highest basal area increments in forests with medium stand basal areas and small to medium sized trees. Stand basal area increases correlated positively with water availability, and were enhanced in warmer areas. Recent climatic warming caused an increase in stand basal area, but this increase was offset by water availability. Based on recent trends in basal area change we conclude that the potential rate of aboveground carbon accumulation in European forests strongly depends on both stand structure and concomitant climate <b>warming,</b> adding <b>weight</b> to suggestions that European carbon stocks may saturate in the near future...|$|R

The first one (MP 1) is prescribed by current Croatian regulation (N. N. 119 / 1999) and the other five were developed on the basis of original data obtained by the experiment. The meat percentage estimated by equation MP 1 differed statistically (p< 0. 01) from mean meat percentage obtained by EU referent method; the current formula significantly overestimates the meatiness of pig carcasses from Croatian population. Original measures of fat and muscle measured for “ZP”- method were used as independent variables in equation MP 6. In order to improve the accuracy of estimation, transformed variables were used in equations MP 2 -MP 5. Additional measure of <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight</b> (T) was included as an independent variable to equations MP 4 and MP 5 but this did not improve their accuracy.

Recent studies using computer tasks have suggested that this overestimation is not completely overridden when adults reason about the knowledge other people gain from their physical interactions with the world. The aim of the current study was to characterize source of knowledge processing in adults when they have to reason about their own sources of knowledge during on-line physical interactions with the environment. Thirty right-handed healthy volunteers were asked to answer as quickly as possible questions regarding the characteristics of an object placed inside a box. The object changed from trial to trial, and could vary in color (white or green), temperature (cold or <b>warm),</b> and <b>weight</b> (heavy or light). To answer each question, participants could perform one of three actions: 1) looking at the object inside the box (opening the box from one side), 2) touching the object (through a hole {{on the front of the}} box), or 3) lifting the object (pulling a string on top of the box). Overt responses were recorded by the experimenter and showed that in the first block of trials, 30 % of the participants wrongly choose a looking action to verify non-visual object properties.

Thirty-eight male lambs {{with an average}} weight of 4. 44 ± 0. 48 were randomly divided into two groups. The lambs in one group were partially docked at 3 - 4 h after birth, using rubber rings, and the lambs in another group remained intact (control). After weaning, 20 male lambs from each group {{were divided into two}} subgroups; one subgroup was fed with a normal dietary energy level (2. 45 Mcal/kg ME) and the other subgroup received a high-energy diet (2. 73 Mcal/kg ME) for 84 days. The lambs were fed individually. At the end of the fattening period, the lambs were slaughtered for determination of carcass characteristics. <b>Warm</b> carcass <b>weight</b> (WCW) and fat depth at the 12 th rib was recorded. At 24 h postmortem, samples of omental fat (for chemical analysis), and caudal fat were taken from chilled (4 °C) carcasses for the determination of fatty acid (FA) composition. No significant difference was observed for the weight gain between docked and control lambs during the suckling period. During the fattening period, docked lambs as well as lambs on high level of energy diet showed better weight gain (P 0. 05) was observed for WCW and fat depth at the 12 th rib between docked and control lambs, but WCW was significantly affected by the diet energy density (P < 0. 05).

We examined fattening performances and the following carcass traits: dressing percentage, weight of valuable carcass cuts, percentage of valuable meat, bone to meat ratio, and as well as meat conformation and fat cover (S/EUROP grading). In the present investigation, the weight at slaughter was fixed between 31 – 32 kg approximately, thus ensuring, weight would not affect carcass composition. Standardizing carcass weight allowed us to spot differences due to genotype and gender. The best results of fattening performance showed the Hungarian Merino × Ile de France F 1 lambs (358 g/day).

The animals studied were random samples from groups, {{which had been}} fattened for 2 months on three different rations. They were about 14 months old at slaughter, and their weights at slaughter ranged from 25 to 52 kg. The average dressing percentage for rams and wethers was 53. 0 and 52. 2 % respectively. <b>Warm</b> carcass <b>weights</b> were 20. 22 kg for rams and 19. 64 kg for wethers, and these carcasses lost 4. 2 and 3. 1 % of their weight, respectively, after 48 h storage in the cold room at 0 °C. The bone content of carcasses of rams and wethers was 23. 4 and 21. 3 % respectively. The longissimus dorsi ‘loin eye’ area at the 12 th rib was 8. 6 sq. cm. for rams and wethers. The proportions of wholesale cuts in ram and wether carcasses were comparable, whereas the proportions of slaughter by-products varied between the two. Mean weight of kidney fat in wethers was 50 % greater than in intact rams, but the messentric and caul fat was heavier in rams than in wethers. Ram carcasses had higher specific gravity than those of wether carcasses. Specific gravity was negatively correlated with fat content and positively correlated with protein, moisture and ash content of the edible meat of the carcass. The regression equations relating specific gravity to the major chemical components of meat had too high standard errors to be of predictive value in practice...|$|R
40|$|In {{environmental}} {{systems analysis}} {{tools such as}} cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and life-cycle assessments (LCA), generic values for impacts {{on the environment and}} human health are frequently used. There are several sets of generic values, which are based on different valuation methods, e. g. willingness-to-pay, abatement costs, taxes or non-monetary assessments. This study attempts to derive a consistent set of damage-based values based on estimation of willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid damages. Where possible we compile existing damage cost estimates from different sources. Currently, there are no generic damage costs available for eutrophication and acidification. We derive damage values for eutrophying and acidifying substances using WTP estimates from available valuation studies. For eutrophication, we derive benefit transfer functions for eutrophication that allows calculation of site-specific values. We compare the derived ecosystem damage values to existing estimates of the cost for reducing nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to water. The analysis indicates that many abatement measures for nitrogen have a positive net benefit while most measures to reduce phosphorus cost more than the benefit achieved when estimated on a general level and should, instead, be assessed on a case-specific level. Moreover, a comparison of the existing environmental taxes on nitrogen, nitrogen oxides and phosphorus in Sweden show that the current tax rates do not reflect the externalities from these pollutants. Subsequently, we construct a weighting set by combining the derived values with existing generic damage values for human toxicity, photochemical oxidants and global <b>warming.</b> The <b>weighting</b> set - labelled Ecovalue 09 - is applied to three case studies and the outcome is compared to the results using other weighting sets.

The diets contained 0, 30, 35 and 40 % BDG in Treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The experiment was in a completely randomized design (CRD) with each treatment replicated three times. Live weight, weight gain, feed and protein intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) were measured. Other measurements were feed cost of weight gain, gross margin, <b>warm</b> dressed <b>weight,</b> carcass and organ characteristics. Results showed that weaner pigs fed 40 % BDG diet had significantly (P< 0. 05) higher protein intake (113. 65 g) than others, while increasing levels of BDG in the diets significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased feed cost at the weaner stage. At the grower stage, pigs fed 35 % BDG diet had weight gain, FCR and PER values similar to those fed control diet, while BDG diets significantly affected back fat (1 st rib) thickness, carcass length and percent spleen. It was concluded that weaner pigs could be fed 40 % BDG diet to reduce feed cost, without adverse effect on growth performance. At the grower stage, the optimum inclusion level of BDG in the pig`s diet should be 35 %, although 40 % BDG diet could be fed to reduce feed cost without adverse effect on carcass quality and organ characteristics of the pigs...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare slaughtering traits of two pig genotypes when reared in two different ways, and to determine the influence of pig housing on carcass characteristics and muscle tissue quality. The research was carried out on 68 fattening pigs of both sex, divided into two groups: the first group was kept on deep litter, and the second one was housed in flat deck pens without deep litter. Each group consisted of pigs of two genotypes, i. e. three-way crossbreeds of Large White and German Landrace (LW x GL) in the dam line and of German Landrace and Pietrain (P) in the sire line. At the end of the experiment, pigs were slaughtered and the following values were determined: the pH 45 and pH 24 values, electric conductivity values (EC 45, EC 24), the “a” and “b” carcass length, loin values and the values of backfat and muscle thickness, aiming to evaluate the share of muscular tissue in carcass by applying the two-points method. Pigs reared on deep litter had statistically significantly smaller live weights (P< 0. 05) and <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weights</b> in comparison to pigs reared on flat deck without deep litter. Pigs crossed with Pietrain, which were kept without deep litter had significantly thicker muscles than the ones crossed with German Landrace, kept on deep litter (P< 0. 05).

Ten healthy subjects performed pre- and posttraining tests with each leg. For ExRA, after subjects <b>warmed</b> up, a <b>weight</b> was added each minute {{until they were}} exhausted. ExIS was similar, but after warm-up, we inflated a thigh cuff to 150 mmHg instead of adding weights. One leg was chosen for TrIS+EX (cuff inflated to 150 mmHg during exercise) {{and the other for}} TrEX, both with a small weight on each leg, four to six times per daily session for 3 to 5 min each, 5 days per week for 6 weeks. ExIS duration increased 120 % more (p = 0. 002) in the TrIS+EX leg than in the contralateral TrEX leg, whereas ExRA duration increased only 16 % (nonsignificant). TrIS+EX and TrEX significantly attenuated the ventilation increase (ergoreflex) during ExIS. The O 2 debt for ExIS was sig-nificantly lower and systolic blood pressure recovery was faster after TrIS+EX than after TrEX. Heart rate recovery after ExRA and ExIS was faster after TrIS+EX.

40|$|Summary In Swiss mice {{sustained}} energy intake (SusEI) {{during peak}} lactation {{has been previously}} suggested to be constrained by {{the capacity of the}} mammary glands to produce milk, supporting the “peripheral limitation” hypothesis. Here we experimentally examined if SusEI in these mice was not only limited peripherally but also constrained by the ability to dissipate heat. Female Swiss mice were provided with additional offspring above their natural litter sizes and were maintained during lactation either in warm (23 °C) or cold (5 °C) conditions. Food intake, thermogenesis, litter size and mass, and the weight of the mammary glands were measured. No differences were observed in asymptotic food intake at peak lactation, litter mass and thermogenesis between females raising litters of different size. Cold-exposed females increased food intake and thermogenic capacity, but weaned significantly smaller and lighter litters with smaller pup sizes compared with females in <b>warm</b> conditions. The <b>weight</b> of the mammary glands did not differ between warm and cold-exposed females, but within temperatures was positively related to litter mass. These data suggested that cold exposure increased food intake, but had no effect on the capacity of the mammary glands to secret milk because they were already working maximally in the females raising larger litters. The factors causing this limit in the mammary capacity remain elusive...|$|R

The other two groups were kept in pens and fed freshly cut guinea grass and concentrate at an amount of 1. 5 % (GC 1. 5) and 2. 0 % (GC 2. 0) of body weight, respectively. The effect of the different feeding intensities on carcass characteristics and meat quality were assessed. The mean body weight at slaughter was 398 (± 16) kg. Average daily gain was higher in concentrate-supplemented groups (570 and 540 g/d in GC 1. 5 and GC 2. 0, respectively) when compared to GG (316 g/d) and GL (354 g/d) (p< 0. 01). Likewise, the <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight</b> was higher in GC 1. 5 and GC 2. 0 compared to GG and GL. Dressing percentage was 48. 1 % and 49. 5 % in GC 1. 5 and GC 2. 0 in comparison to 42. 9 % and 44. 8 % observed in GG and GL, respectively. Meat of Longissimus throracis from GC 1. 5 and GC 2. 0 was redder in color (p< 0. 01), while water holding capacity (drip and thawing loss) was improved in pasture-fed groups (p< 0. 05). Protein and fat content of Longissimus thoracis was higher in animals supplemented with concentrate (p< 0. 01), as was cholesterol content (p< 0. 05), whereas PUFA:SFA ratio was higher and n- 6 /n- 3 ratio lower (p< 0. 01) in pasture-fed buffaloes.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} study the importance of early rumen development and of the composition of solid feed intake on growth performance and abomasal health in milk-fed veal calves. One hundred and six Holstein-Friesian male calves {{were included in the}} experiment, and studied during 2 successive 12 -wk periods (period 1 and period 2). In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, effects of partially replacing milk replacer by solid feed during period 1 and partially replacing dry matter (DM) intake from maize silage and barley straw by concentrate during period 2 were tested. Solid feed during period 1 consisted of maize silage, barley straw, and concentrate (25 : 25 : 50 on a DM basis). Solid feed during period 2 consisted of maize silage and barley straw (50 : 50 ratio on DM basis) for the nonconcentrate groups, and maize silage, barley straw and concentrates (25 : 25 : 50 on a DM basis) for the concentrate groups. At the end of period 1 (n = 16) {{and at the end of}} period 2 (n = 90), parameters of animal performance, rumen development, rumen fermentation, ruminal drinking, and abomasal damage were examined. Partially replacing milk replacer by solid feed during period 1 resulted in early rumen development (ERD) at the end of period 1, characterized by increased rumen weight, and an increased epithelial and absorptive surface area. Both ERD and partially replacing roughage by concentrates in period 2 increased the rumen development score at the end of period 2. Although ERD calves consumed more solid feed and less milk replacer during period 1 and 2 than non-ERD calves, carcass weight gains at 25 wk were identical, and utilization of the solid feed provided appeared similar to that of milk replacer. Partially replacing roughage by concentrates in period 2 increased dressing percentage and <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight.</b> Plaque formation at the rumen mucosa was unaffected by ERD or partially replacing roughage by concentrates and generally low in all calves. The prevalence of large scars in the abomasum in ERD calves was decreased compared with non-ERD calves. This may indicate that ERD provided protection against abomasal lesions. In conclusion, early compared with late rumen development improves feed utilization and may be beneficial for abomasal healt...|$|R

Fattening animals started at body weight of about 30 kg and continued to the average body weight of about 115 kg. The body weight of animals and the quantity of the consumed feed mixtures were recorded during the fattening period. Meatiness of carcasses was evaluated according to the current classification of the EUROP apparatus IM- 03. The analysis has been subjected to the following features: total weight gain, fattening period, average daily weight gain, slaughter age and consumption of feed during the fattening and slaughter features: <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight,</b> slaughter efficiency, fat thickness, the depth of loin muscle and meat content in the carcass. The assessment also includes: the sales value of porker in accordance with the evaluation of their carcasses according to the EUROP and the cost of feeding porker during the whole period of fattening.

Such cultures were compared with kidney tissue cultures to which only G. A. was added with the concentrations of 0. 25 % and 0. 5 %, and tissue culture cells without any addition of the previously mentioned materials. The results demonstrated the best growth for cells to which metabolites were supplemented with G. A. In two separate experiments G. A. dust was used as a feed additive for sheep and goats. In the first experiment 28 sheep, 6 months of age were divided into four groups of the same age and weight, (seven VIII animals in each group). For the experimental groups G. A. was added to the rations as follows: group 1 received 10 % G. A., group 2 received 20 % G. A. and group 3 received 30 %, and accordingly the control group received no G. A. All rations were fed in a mesh form. In the second experiment 36 sheep were divided into four groups of the same age a nd weight, (9 animals in each group). The experimental design was performed as: group I received 5 % G. A., group 2 received 10 % G. A., group 3 received 20 % G. A. and group 4 received zero G. A., as control group. Also 16 goats were divided into 2 groups, the first group received a ration to which G. A. was supplemented at a rate of 10 % and the second group was left as the control group. The ration in the second experiment was prepared as pelleted ration. In both experiments parameters like body weight, blood urea, creatinine, haemoglobin, packed cell volume (PCV), total bacterial counts, and the isolation and identification of the isolated bacteria were determined. After two months from the initiation of the experiment, 3 sheep and 4 goats from each experimental group were slaughtered for the determination of <b>warm</b> carcass <b>weight,</b> chilled carcass weight and the net gross weight. IX In spite of that the results of the statistical analysis showed that differences of body weight gains were not significant, but noticeable differences between average weight gains between groups can be noticed mainly for the group with 10 % G.

The physical form of the ration showed no statistical differences between all treatments and all groups, but only slight variations within the groups. Only variation was noticed in the feed intake and the body weight gain. The corresponding carcasses were analyzed for standard chemical analysis parameters for meat. An in vitro experiment was conducted in the laboratory in which G.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Forecasts of {{the impacts}} of climate change have {{traditionally}} focused on individual species and their phenotypes, phenology, or distribution. However, shifts in species distributions and the resulting reorganization of community composition represent an important violation to the assumption of species acting in isolation. Whereas species may respond individualistically to climate change, the manifestations of their responses will be largely influenced by interactions with other organisms. Tractably dealing with complex interaction networks {{in the face of}} climate change will require an understanding of community dynamics {{and the degree to which}} biotic interactions influence species' behavior, physiology, and survival – and ultimately their footprint on the landscape. To improve our understanding of community-level responses to climate change, I explored amphibian response strategies from both a population- and community-level perspective and provided a critical evaluation of one of the primary methods for incorporating biotic interactions into predictive species distribution models. In Chapter 2, I evaluated amphibian species’ physiological constraints and the potential consequences of phenotypic plasticity as a first step to understanding their sensitivity, and ultimately, adaptive capacity to climate change. I experimentally quantified phenotypic plasticity in larval growth and development in three high elevation Anuran species (Anaxyrus boreas, Pseudacris regilla, and Rana cascadae) in response to projected climate warming scenarios for the Cascade Mountain Range. <b>Warming</b> initiated faster <b>weight</b> gain and accelerated larval growth rates in each of the species. However, any effort to achieve optimum body size (in both length and weight), while maintaining the necessary developmental trajectory under heat stress, was relatively unsuccessful. In Chapter 3, I tested the response strategies of the same three Anuran species to a different climate stressors, hydroperiod reduction (i. e. drought), and included the additional stress of interspecific competition. I found that competition exacerbated the effects of drying on competitively inferior species (Anaxyrus boreas and Pseudacris regilla) and that, in general, species responses were largely context-dependent. My results emphasize the importance of biotic interactions in predictions of species response to climate change. In Chapter 4, I provide a critical evaluation of standard methods for incorporating biotic interactions into predictive species distribution models. Most methods utilize observational data via species co-occurrences on the landscape to infer the role of biotic interactions in structuring species distributions. Results from a series of tests using two long-term amphibian co-occurrence datasets from Mt. Rainier National Park (Washington) and Mt. Hood (Oregon) show that the current best available methods are largely disconnected from community ecology theory and have yet to reconcile the complex dynamics within trophically-structured communities. My research aims to fill a critical knowledge gap in the connection between community dynamics and biogeography, with significant implications for conservation and management of a severely threatened taxonomic group. I highlight the significant challenges of estimating species response to climate change across multiple levels of taxonomic organization and spatio-temporal scales...|$|R

This work was prompted by original effort of developing low temperature SiGe BiCMOS modules for Martine and Lunar exploration. Current exploration vehicles use a "warm electronic box (WEB) " to maintain the electronics in an earth-like temperature environment. This results in increasing system complexity and <b>weight.</b> <b>Warm</b> boxes also consume power and are not practical for the ~ 330 hour lunar night. Furthermore, intelligent nodes in a distributed system must operate in an ambient environment to monitor the health and performance of a space craft or rover, to sense the environment for scientific exploration and {{to act on the}} environment, such as to use a drill to obtain a soil sample for analysis. Nevertheless, the reliability and life span of electronic devices systems without WEB can be significantly degraded by thermal fatigue damage as a result of wide daily temperature swings during their space exploration, when cryogenic temperatures (below - 55 oC) can be encountered. Attachment layer, such as die attach, solder joint and substrate attach are most inclined to fatigue damage due to the global CTE mismatch between packaging materials and their material properties at extreme cold temperatures. With the aim of enhancing the reliability of cryogenic electronic package, indium was selected as the attachment material due to its excellent wetting capability, greater ductility and high electrical conductivity, with respect to standard PbSn solders at cryogenic temperatures. However, information on the reliability of indium attach is sparse and only concerns isothermal fatigue conditions at room temperature. No investigation has been reported on its thermal fatigue ranging from cryogenic temperature to high homologous temperatures (above room temperature), or on its isothermal fatigue behavior at cryogenic temperatures, or of the effect of microstructure evolution, in terms of intermetallics, under isothermal fatigue conditions on joint lifetime. Current lack of these fundamental understanding inhibits the assessment of the reliability of indium attach. In this thesis, an efficient and systematic assessment was conducted to evaluate the reliability of indium attach. Constitutive properties of indium solder joint at extended low temperature were measured and the Anand constitutive model was validated for an extended temperature range, - 150 oC to 140 oC, including extreme cold temperature. This was used to assess thermal fatigue life of indium attach. The effect of intermetallics and surface finishes on the reliability of indium attach subjected to mechanical fatigue has also been investigated. In addition, fatigue failure site, modes and mechanisms in indium attach at low temperature were identified and correlated with microstructure evolution. A fatigue model was also calibrated for indium attach at cryogenic temperatures...|$|R
