5|$|President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{attended}} 10 official inaugural balls {{during the}} evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white <b>waistcoat</b> and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waistcoats</b> were high-waisted, and {{squared off}} at the bottom, but came in a broad variety of styles. They were often double-breasted, with wide lapels and stand collars. Around 1805 large lapels that {{overlapped}} those of the jacket began {{to fall out of}} fashion, as did the 18th century tradition of wearing the coat unbuttoned, and gradually <b>waistcoats</b> became less visible. Shortly before this time <b>waistcoats</b> were commonly vertically striped but by 1810 plain white <b>waistcoats</b> were increasingly fashionable, as did horizontally striped <b>waistcoats.</b> High-collared <b>waistcoats</b> were fashionable until 1815, then collars were gradually lowered as the shawl collar came into use toward the end of this period.|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the <b>waistcoat</b> was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E
