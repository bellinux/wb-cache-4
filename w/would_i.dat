5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> bless Him? Every {{fiber in}} me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves?

Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E

5|$|The sixth set of episodes also stayed {{below the}} 4 million mark, {{but in an}} evening that saw ITV beat BBC One's {{audience}} share in the evening by 19.6% to 19%, including the earlier episode of Red of Black? gaining 3.8m viewers, while the later show was viewed by slightly more with 3.9m. However, in direct competition with the later show was BBC One's <b>Would</b> <b>I</b> Lie to You? which had slightly more viewers, with 4m tuning in. On the return of Red or Black? to Saturday night, the show climbed above 4 million {{for the first time}} in three days, to 4.63m for the first show and then up to 5.67m for the second. This enabled ITV to beat BBC One in the primetime ratings overall, by 23.3% to 21%, even though the first episode of series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing was broadcast on BBC. However Red or Black? individually placed behind both Strictly and Doctor Who, with the overnights for the BBC shows being 7.6 and 6.0 million, respectively. Overall through the week the main ITV channel had a higher share of the ratings during primetime than BBC One on five out of the seven occasions, a turnaround from the previous week where it only won on a single evening.|$|E

25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took me almost seven hours. But neither <b>would</b> <b>I</b> pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E
