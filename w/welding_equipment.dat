5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and <b>welding</b> <b>equipment.</b> In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E

This work aimed to study the weldability of zinc coated and uncoated steel sheets for automotive industry, comparing the performance of two <b>welding</b> <b>equipments</b> with two current outputkinds: alternating current (AC) and medium frequency direct current (DC). The welding parameters were kept constant: 260 kgf (force), 150 ms (time) and 7. 0 kA (welding current), based upon an optimization parameters methodology. The joints were characterized using optical metallography (spot diameter, indentation depth and weld penetration depth), mechanical tensile-shear tests and electrical measurements: contact electrical resistance, dynamic resistance and dynamic energy. The results showed that welding in medium frequency direct current was more efficient in generating heat in zinc coated sheets and uncoated sheets than alternating current <b>equipment.</b> In <b>welding</b> using AC and DC equipments in zinc coated sheets, the spot weld time formation was 25 ms longer than uncoated steel sheets spot weld time. The burn of zinc during welding did not damage the spot weld formation with AC or DC equipments. The electrical contact resistance increased with the roughnessand also presented 52 % higher in uncoated sheets than in zinc coated sheets.

2500|$|For joining complex {{injection}} molded thermoplastic parts, ultrasonic <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> can {{be easily}} customized to fit the exact specifications of the parts being welded. The parts are sandwiched between a fixed shaped nest (anvil) and a sonotrode (horn) connected to a transducer, and a ~20 kHz low-amplitude acoustic vibration is emitted. (Note: Common frequencies used in ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics are 15kHz, 20kHz, 30kHz, 35kHz, 40kHz and 70kHz). When welding plastics, the interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the melting process. One of the materials usually has a spiked energy director which contacts the second plastic part. The ultrasonic energy melts the point contact between the parts, creating a joint. This process is a good automated alternative to glue, screws or snap-fit designs.

The development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> is quite versatile – {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E
