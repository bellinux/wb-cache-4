5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> {{of the few}} outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> <b>One</b> of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> of the fastest cars here. That’s what it takes to run at this level, {{to be a part of}} that Chase, if we can go and continue to have as much fun as we did this weekend. I know it’s the key, I know it is to my success." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{month in}} advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the {{captaincy}} after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that [...] "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly... It's rarely a job you will last long in... I also had a two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furtwängler's {{name was}} {{included}} on the Gottbegnadeten list ("God-gifted List") of September 1944, but was removed on December 7, 1944 because of his relationships with German resistance. Furtwängler had strong links to the German resistance which organized the 20 July plot. He stated during his denazification trial that he knew an attack was being organized against Hitler, {{although he did not}} participate in its organization. He knew Claus von Stauffenberg very well and his doctor, Johannes Ludwig Schmitt, who wrote him many false health prescriptions to bypass official requirements, {{was a member of the}} Kreisau Circle. Furtwängler's concerts were sometimes chosen by the members of the German resistance as a meeting point. Rudolf Pechel, a member of the resistance group which organized the 20 July plot said to Furtwängler after the war: [...] "In the circle of our resistance movement it was an accepted fact that you were the only one in the whole of our musical world who really resisted, and you were one of us." [...] Graf Kaunitz, also a member of that circle, stated: [...] "In Furtwängler's concerts <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> big family of the resistance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E
