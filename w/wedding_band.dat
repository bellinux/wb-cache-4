5|$|The {{wedding is}} deemed not in {{accordance}} to Hindu rituals. Banai and Khandoba marry in a simple, un-Brahmanical ceremony, where sheep droppings are showered on the couple, instead of rice as in the ritualistic weddings of classical (Brahmanical) Hinduism. The wedding is conducted without a Brahmin officiating priest. Shepherds read the mantras (the responsibility of the Brahmin in a normal wedding) and the bleating of sheep replaces the traditional <b>wedding</b> <b>band.</b> The wedding is sometimes described as a gandharva marriage. Due to the unceremonious nature of the wedding, she is sometimes considered as a rakh (concubine) of Khandoba.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold <b>wedding</b> <b>band</b> was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E

25|$|A single {{electronic}} kit can (via its module or software) {{simulate the}} sounds of countless acoustic kits and instruments/effects. A drummer in a cover band or <b>wedding</b> <b>band</b> can switch instantly, for instance, between a vintage jazz drum kit and a powerful maple rock kit. Other options include congas, piano, guitar, brushes, orchestral timpani, gongs or even add hand claps or sound effects such as a sirens. In the 2010s, many non-musical samples and effects are available. It is therefore possible to achieve much more than one can with an acoustic kit alone and one has to transport significantly less kit to play {{a wide variety of}} sounds and instruments.|$|E

25|$|After {{committing}} {{to build the}} statue, Blumberg was invited to Fort Campbell, where he met veterans of Task Force Dagger. He learned that his depiction of the Green Beret wasn't at all accurate. Blumberg invited them to his studio where they worked closely with him {{to be sure he}} got the horse and soldier precisely correct. Blumberg took six weeks to re-sculpt the piece until he was sure it was accurate in every detail. It depicts a Special Forces Green Beret on horseback leading the invasion into Afghanistan. He is holding field glasses in one hand. An M4 with an attached grenade launcher is slung under his shoulder. An outline of a <b>wedding</b> <b>band</b> is visible under the glove of the soldier's left hand. Blumberg said, “That’s my way of tipping my hat to wives, marriages and strain on families. It’s to acknowledge the stresses caused by multiple deployments.” Blumberg created the sculpture's face without using a model or photos. It does not represent the face of a specific individual.|$|E

The art historian Lorne Campbell has noted her facial similarity to the Virgin in Memling's panel at the National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon. In this work, Maria's frame is slightly undersized compared to her head, a common characteristic of contemporary northern portraiture, also found in similar works by Rogier van der Weyden and Petrus Christus. Her elbows rest on an unseen parapet that coincides with the lower edge of the painted stone [...] frame, acting as a trompe-l'œil which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer.

While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age, Moti made the decision that Este would be more suited to the bass, buying her a second hand Fender for $50. The siblings were encouraged to listen to their parents' 1970s classic rock and Americana records and, during their childhood, the family formed a band called Rockinhaim to play cover versions at local charity fairs, with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar.

According to John Updike, the work is painted without any painterly brushwork. According to Robert Scholes, the work shows audience members in rapt attention with a sort of admiration of this lone speaker.|$|E
