40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of x-ray beams typically take {{parameters of the}} electron beam in the accelerating waveguide to be free parameters. In this paper, a methodology is proposed and implemented to determine the energy, spectral width, and beam divergence of the electron source. All treatment head components {{were removed from the}} beam path, leaving only the <b>exit</b> <b>window.</b> With the x-ray target and flattener out of the beam, uncertainties in physical characteristics and relative position of the target and flattening filter, and in spot size, did not contribute to uncertainty in the energy. Beam current was lowered to reduce recombination effects. The measured dose distributions were compared with Monte Carlo simulation of the electron beam through the treatment head to extract the electron source characteristics. For the nominal 6 and 18 MV x-ray beams, the energies were 6. 51 ± 0. 15 and 13. 9 ± 0. 2 MeV, respectively, with the uncertainties resulting from uncertainties in the detector position in the measurement and in the stopping power in the simulations. Gaussian spectral distributions were used, with full widths at half maximum ranging from 20 ± 4 % at 6 MV to 13 ± 4 % at 18 MV required to match the fall-off portion of the percent-depth ionization curve. Profiles at the depth of maximum dose from simulations that used the manufacturer-specified <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> geometry and no beam divergence were 2 – 3 cm narrower than measured profiles. Two simulation configurations yielding the measured profile width were the manufacturer-specified <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> thickness with electron source divergences of 3. 3 ° at 6 MV and 1. 8 ° at 18 MV and an <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> 40 % thicker than the manufacturer’s specification with no beam divergence. With the x-ray target in place (and no flattener), comparison of measured to simulated profiles sets upper limits on the electron source divergences of 0. 2 ° at 6 MV and 0. 1 ° at 18 MV. A method of determining source characteristics without mechanical modification of the treatment head, and therefore feasible in clinics, is presented. The energies and spectral widths determined using this method agree with those determined with only the <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> in the beam path...|$|R

40|$|Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) is an {{ion beam}} {{analysis}} technique. In PIXE, {{atoms in the}} sample are excited when the sample is bombarded with protons, alpha particles, or heavy ions. X-rays are emitted when atoms in the sample de-excite. Each element has unique characteristic x-rays. In the spectrum, area of each peak {{is proportional to the}} elemental concentration in the sample. The existing PIXE set-up in the accelerator laboratory was upgraded to external beam PIXE to do in air measurements, because of need to analyse large amounts of archaeological samples. Different <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> set-ups were constructed and tested. The goal was to get maximum beam spot area with minimum beam energy loss in the <b>exit</b> <b>window.</b> The set-up enables the use of 100 nm thick Si 3 N 4 <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> membranes and 4 -mm-diameter beam spot area. For the measurements in the current work, a 500 nm thick Si 3 N 4 membrane was used due to its higher durability. Current measurement can be difficult when doing PIXE in air because of ionization of air molecules in the beam's path and charge collection differences at sample surface. The set-up utilizes a beam profile monitor (BPM), which measures the current in vacuum prior to the <b>exit</b> <b>window,</b> and therefore is not affected by the current measurement difficulties in air. Along with the BPM, a current integrator was also used in the current measurements. Current integrator was used to collect the charge from the sample holder. These two methods together provided reliable way of current measurement.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purposes}} of this study are to improve the accuracy of source and geometry parameters used in the simulation of large electron fields from a clinical linear accelerator and to evaluate improvement in the accuracy of the calculated dose distributions. Methods: The monitor chamber and scattering foils of a clinical machine not in clinical service were removed for direct measurement of component geometry. Dose distributions were measured at various stages of reassembly, reducing the number of geometry variables in the simulation. The measured spot position and beam angle were found to vary with the beam energy. A magnetic field from the bending magnet was found between the <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> and the secondary collimators of sufficient strength to deflect electrons 1 cm off the beam axis at 100 cm from the <b>exit</b> <b>window.</b> The <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> was 0. 05 cm thicker than manufacturer 2 ̆ 019 s specification, with over half of the increased thickness due to water pressure in the channel used to cool the window.

40|$|Journal articlePurpose: Monte Carlo (MC) {{simulation}} can be {{used for}} accurate electron beam treatment planning and modeling. Measurement of large electron fields, with the applicator removed and secondary collimator wide open, has been shown to provide accurate simulation parameters, including asymmetry in the measured dose, for the full range of clinical field sizes and patient positions. Recently, disassembly of the treatment head of a linear accelerator has been used to refine the simulation of the electron beam, setting tightly measured constraints on source and geometry parameters used in simulation. The simulation did not explicitly include the known deflection of the electron beam by a fringe magnetic field from the bending magnet, which extended into the treatment head. Instead, the secondary scattering foil and monitor chamber were unrealistically laterally offset to account for the beam deflection. This work is focused on accounting for this fringe magnetic field in treatment head simulation. Methods: The magnetic field below the <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> of a Siemens Oncor linear accelerator was measured with a Tesla-meter from 0 to 12 cm from the <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> and 1 - 3 cm off-axis. Treatment head simulation was performed with the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code, modified to incorporate the effect of the magnetic field on charged particle transport. Simulations were used to analyze the sensitivity of dose profiles to various sources of asymmetry in the treatment head. This included the lateral spot offset and beam angle at the <b>exit</b> <b>window,</b> the fringe magnetic field and independent lateral offsets of the secondary scattering foil and electron monitor chamber. Simulation parameters were selected within the limits imposed by measurement uncertainties. Calculated dose distributions were then compared with those measured in water. Results: The magnetic field was a maximum at the <b>exit</b> <b>window,</b> increasing from 0. 006 T at 6 MeV to 0. 020 T at 21 MeV and dropping to approximately 5 % of the maximum at the secondary scattering foil. It was up to three times higher in the bending plane, away from the electron gun, and symmetric within measurement uncertainty in the transverse plane. Simulations showed the magnetic field resulted in an offset of the electron beam of 0. 80 cm (mean) at the machine isocenter for the <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> only configuration. The fringe field resulted in a 3. 5 %- 7. 6 % symmetry and 0. 25 - 0. 35 cm offset of the clinical beam R-max profiles. With the magnetic field included in simulations, a single (realistic) position of the secondary scattering foil and monitor chamber was selected. Measured and simulated dose profiles showed agreement to an average of 2. 5 %/ 0. 16 cm (maximum: 3 %/ 0. 2 cm), which is a better match than previously achieved without incorporating the magnetic field in the simulation. The undulations from the 3 stepped layers of the secondary scattering foil, evident in the measured profiles of the higher energy beams, are now aligned with those in the simulated beam. The simulated fringe magnetic field had negligible effect on the central axis depth dose curves and cross-plane dose profiles. Conclusions: The fringe magnetic field is a significant contributor to the electron beam in-plane asymmetry. With the magnetic field included explicitly in the simulation, realistic monitor chamber and secondary scattering foil positions have been achieved, and the calculated fluence and dose distributions are more accurate.

This study presents a methodology for analysing the selectivity of fishing gears from unpaired test and control data. The uncertainty in the control and test population structures is accounted for by using a double bootstrapping procedure that takes into account both between-haul and within-haul variation.
