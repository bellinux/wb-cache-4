5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working <b>well</b> <b>without</b> music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks <b>well,</b> <b>without</b> waddling, {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups {{in the middle of the}} day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.|$|E

5000|$|The film's protagonist, Antun [...] "Nuno" [...] Gabajček is {{a master}} of a dying trade: he excavates <b>wells</b> <b>without</b> using machines, relying only on hand tools. This {{approach}} is not just highly demanding physically, but also requires well-thought-out methods and resourcefulness.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 {{there were}} 1,100 active {{production}} wells, along with 57 injection wells. Careful {{study of the}} fractured nature of the oil-bearing geologic units allowed operators to shut down almost 400 of the least efficient <b>wells</b> <b>without</b> diminishing the overall output of the field.|$|R

25|$|Built in Fishponds, Bristol by Brazil-Straker {{under the}} {{direction}} of Roy Fedden, the Mercury featured an unusual crankshaft and connecting rod arrangement that dispensed with the more normal design of a single master rod linking to individual rods for each cylinder. It was said to run <b>well</b> <b>without</b> vibration and set an unofficial time to climb record while fitted to the Bristol Scout F, the aircraft achieving 10,000ft (3,000 m) in 5.4 minutes and 20,000ft (6,000 m) in 16.25 minutes.|$|E

In June he finished strongly to take second place, a neck behind Sweep Tosho in the Takarazuka Kinen, beating major winners such as Zenno Rob Roy and Tap Dance City. He was then off the course for more than four months.|$|E

30|$|Dynamic data {{such as the}} {{injection}} pressure and {{the injection}} rate are indispensable to evaluate the resistance factor by both the Hall plot method and the RPI method during water flooding. However, for new wells or converted <b>wells</b> <b>without</b> water-flooding history, {{the rate of change}} of the RPI is the only effective way for injection effect evaluation.|$|R
30|$|The rate {{of change}} of the RPI can quantitatively {{describe}} the response rate of chemical flooding. The greater the {{rate of change}} of the RPI is, the faster the chemical flooding takes effect. Since only injection data of the chemical flooding stage is needed for evaluation, {{the rate of change}} of the RPI is most suitable for <b>wells</b> <b>without</b> water flooding history.|$|R
25|$|Irrigation in Guatemala is {{concentrated}} in three regions of the country. The Atlantic coast region has low humidity and high evapotranspiration so irrigation is needed for the cultivation of bananas, tomatoes, watermelon, and tobacco. The high plains region has very little rain {{for much of the}} year and with fertile volcanic soils that do not retain moisture very <b>well.</b> <b>Without</b> irrigation, there is only one harvest per year so crops such as basic grains require irrigation. The lower coastal zones have irrigated sugarcane and banana plantations.|$|E
25|$|England and Australia {{drew the}} match. England were happy {{that they had}} saved the Test, but their batting was still weak with only Graveney, May and Cowdrey capable of playing Benaud's leg-spin with any confidence. Trueman had bowled <b>well</b> <b>without</b> any luck and Laker and Lock had shown their {{spinning}} skills, but the English fielding needed to be improved. Benaud was criticised for his defensive tactics, but {{said he had a}} job to do and 2–0 up was good for him and his team.|$|E

Peter Acworth, the company's owner, has stated that the structure suits {{the needs of the}} company very <b>well</b> <b>without</b> need for significant structural modifications to the building, and that the company would begin repairs to the decaying structure. It was also announced that Kink.com planned {{at some point in the}} future to rent out studio space for film production of all kinds within The Armory.|$|E

25|$|The {{scarlet-chested parrot}} (Neophema splendida), known {{alternately}} as scarlet-breasted parrot, orange-throated parrot or splendid parrot, is a parrot endemic to central South Australia and inland southern Western Australia. The species is sexually dimorphic; the male has a bright blue face and scarlet chest and yellow underparts, amid overall green plumage, while the female is similar but lacks the red chest. These nomadic parakeets move readily from the Great Victoria Desert region into neighbouring areas. These interruptions are {{triggered by a}} search for more favourable conditions. They can survive quite <b>well</b> <b>without</b> access to drinking water, however, as succulent plants help meet much of their fluid requirement. They feed mainly on grass seeds and are most commonly sighted in spinifex.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, {{expanded}} polypropylene (EPP) foams {{have been}} gaining in popularity and in application as a structural material in hobbyist radio control model aircraft. Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is friable and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam {{is able to}} absorb kinetic impacts very <b>well</b> <b>without</b> breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in {{a short amount of}} time. In consequence, a radio-control model whose wings and fuselage are constructed from EPP foam is extremely resilient, and able to absorb impacts that would result in complete destruction of models made from lighter traditional materials, such as balsa or even EPS foams.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{depends on}} the amount of lung that is {{affected}} and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension. After a massive PE, the embolus must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In thrombotic PE, the blood clot may be broken down by fibrinolysis, or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day or two after a PE. Improvement slows thereafter and some deficits may be permanent. There is controversy over whether small subsegmental PEs need treatment at all and some evidence exists that patients with subsegmental PEs may do <b>well</b> <b>without</b> treatment.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand ran out easy {{winners in}} the First Test, winning inside two days by such a margin that it again called the Zimbabweans Test status into question. After the Zimbabwean seamers made early inroads to {{surprise}} both the New Zealand batsmen and neutral spectators, New Zealand got the match into their groove. Heath Streak, making his return to international cricket after a one-year self-imposed exile following a dispute with the national selectors, bowled <b>well</b> <b>without</b> much reward, while {{from the other end}} Blessing Mahwire removed both openers with three balls, as New Zealand wobbled to 24 for 2. Stephen Fleming and Hamish Marshall rebuilt quickly, punishing Streak in particular, and runs flowed - until Hamish Marshall was lbw to Chris Mpofu with a good in-cutter. New Zealand survived to lunch, but then Nathan Astle and Scott Styris fell, and suddenly the score was 113 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{medicine}} identifies many {{symptoms such as}} fever, pain, and sickness {{behavior as}} evolved responses to protect or enhance the recovery from infection and injury. Fever, for example, is an evolved self-treatment that removes bacteria or viruses through raised body temperature. These evolved responses, however, also have a cost that depending upon circumstances can outweigh their benefit (due to this, for example, there is a reduction in fever during malnutrition or late pregnancy). According to the health management system theory proposed by Nicholas Humphrey, the brain has been selected to ensure that evolved responses are deployed only when the cost benefit is biologically advantageous. To do this, the brain factors {{in a variety of}} information sources, including the likelihood derived from beliefs that the body will get <b>well</b> <b>without</b> deploying its costly evolved responses. One such source of information is the knowledge the body is receiving care and treatment. The placebo effect in this perspective arises when false information about medications misleads the health management system about the likelihood of getting well so that it selects not to deploy an evolved self-treatment.|$|E
25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically <b>well</b> <b>without</b> any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since exercise can cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist clenching can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other hand, processing of heparinised, unclot blood does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|E
