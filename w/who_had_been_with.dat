Offensive coordinator Rob Ambrose accepted the head coaching position at Towson, his alma mater; he would stay to coach UConn during the bowl game, however.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-five men (including replacements) {{formed the}} shore and ship's parties of the Terra Nova Expedition. They were chosen from 8,000applicants, and {{included}} seven Discovery veterans together with five <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> Shackleton on his 1907–09 expedition. Lieutenant Edward Evans, {{who had been the}} navigating officer on Morning, the Discovery expedition's relief ship in 1904, was appointed Scott's second-in-command. He abandoned plans to mount his own expedition, and transferred his financial backing to Scott.|$|E

Valente's goal was to retain {{the feeling of the}} original music while enhancing it for a modern platform. Most of the arrangements were created in the Impulse Tracker format, then converted to MIDI and enhanced with a number of tools.|$|E

5|$|After Dorothy's wedding {{much of the}} {{documentation}} of Olivia's life ceases. She moved out of Brunswick Gardens in 1924, throwing away personal correspondence and giving away hundreds of books. Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in West Kensington, taking with her two maids <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy {{gave birth to a}} son, Omar Pound, who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} {{in the latter}} half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run football operations for the first time in several decades. The Giants on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the hiring. In 1990, Jack Mara's son, Tim, who was struggling with cancer at the time, sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died. His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 2007, Schmid had rebuilt the roster, keeping only three players he had {{inherited}} and acquiring Argentine attacker Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Schmid cut the Crew's goalkeeper, Jon Busch, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> the team for five years. Schmid had concerns over Busch's playing style and fitness. Busch later criticized Schmid's management skills, {{and said he would}} never work for the coach again, but gave credit to Schmid's tactical approach. Scheletto's contributions were crucial to Columbus's improvement that season, but the team failed to make the playoffs. A writer for ESPN speculated that the Crew suffered because the team management would not spend more money, while Schmid lamented that he could not attract a foreign star to the little-known city of Columbus.|$|E

5|$|The Holy See {{also tried}} to reach a {{compromise}} on the Kraków bishopric, but Jan Zamoyski, who was {{in conflict with the}} king, persuaded Andrew to give up his claim in favor of Radziwiłł. Andrew withheld 20,000 gulden from the royal tax of Warmia, saying that the king owed him 40,000 gulden. He started negotiations with John George, Elector of Brandenburg, who promised him the hand of one of his daughters if he accepted the protection of Brandenburg over Warmia. Zamoyski, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> Sigismund III, also persuaded Andrew to make peace with the king in May 1593. Andrew renounced the see of Kraków in exchange for the Abbey of Czerwińsk nad Wisłą.|$|E
5|$|Already {{considered}} washed up, the Giants {{intended to}} have Tittle share quarterback duties with 40-year-old Charlie Conerly, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> the team since 1948. The players at first remained loyal to Conerly, and treated Tittle {{with the cold}} shoulder. Tittle missed the season opener due to a back injury sustained before the season. His first game with New York came in week two, against the Steelers, in which he and Conerly each threw a touchdown pass in the Giants' 17–14 win. He became the team's primary starter {{for the remainder of}} the season and led the revitalized Giants to first place in the Eastern Conference. The Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) awarded Tittle its Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL's players' choice of MVP. In the 1961 NFL Championship Game, the Giants were soundly defeated by Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers, as they were shut-out 0–37. Tittle completed six of twenty passes in the game and threw four interceptions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1940 Lindwall made his first grade rugby league debut in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the St. George club {{alongside}} his older brother Jack, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> the club since 1938. He played at fullback and assumed goal-kicking responsibilities. Lindwall's cricketing improved during the 1940–41 season, taking 34 wickets at 16.45, approximately doubling his wickets while halving their cost. By this time, {{many of his colleagues}} had enlisted in the armed services and the competition was beginning to thin out during World War II. Lindwall missed the 1941 NSWRFL season due to illness, and in doing so missed out on the team that won the premiership that season. In October 1941, Lindwall was selected to make his first-class cricket debut against Queensland in Brisbane, just after turning 20. Playing along his childhood hero McCabe, Lindwall put in a wayward performance. He conceded an expensive 81 runs in 15 wicketless overs and made just one run with the bat. The Sheffield Shield season was cancelled a month later after the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, that signalled the widening of the war into the Pacific arena. The Sydney grade cricket competition continued, and Lindwall helped St. George to a hat-trick of premierships with 27 wickets at 22.19 and 405 runs at 27.00.|$|E
