5|$|Emma Thompson (born 15 April 1959) is a British {{actress and}} screenwriter. She {{is known for}} her portrayals of reticent women, often in period dramas and {{literary}} adaptations, and playing haughty or matronly characters <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of irony. She {{is considered one of}} Britain's most accomplished actresses.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosed with acral lentiginous {{melanoma}} in 1977, Marley died on 11 May 1981 in Miami at age 36. He was {{a committed}} Rastafari who infused his music <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of spirituality. He is credited with popularising reggae music {{around the world and}} served as a symbol of Jamaican culture and identity. Marley has also evolved into a global symbol and inspired numerous items of merchandise.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the interaction of student learning style and presentation mode on student learning in an introduction to computer science class. The learning styles studied were sensing and intuiting, as identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The presentation mode was either traditional lecture or hypermedia. Research has suggested that multimedia methods enhance student learning and that multimedia methods particularly enhance student learning for students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sensing</b> cognitive style. Therefore, it was hypothesized that students who receive multimedia instruction would perform better on examinations than students who receive traditional instruction. It was further hypothesized that students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sensing</b> cognitive style would benefit more-from multimedia instruction than would students <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intuitive cognitive style. This study did not find a significant interaction between presentation mode (lecture or multimedia) and learning style (intuitive or sensing). Nor did i...|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through often <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor that bordered on the absurd.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of the events at Beaumont-Hamel {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme was perhaps most strongly felt by the Dominion of Newfoundland, as it was the first great conflict experienced by that dominion. Newfoundland was left <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of loss that marked an entire generation. The effects on the post-war generation were compounded by chronic financial problems caused both by Newfoundland's large debt from the war, and a prolonged post-war economic recession due to a decline in the fisheries.|$|E
5|$|This onomatopoeic singing {{undercuts}} {{the dangerous}} scene <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour. Tolkien achieves balance of humour and danger through other means as well, {{as seen in}} the foolishness and Cockney dialect of the trolls and in the drunkenness of the elven captors. The general form—that of a journey into strange lands, told in a light-hearted mood and interspersed with songs—may be following the model of The Icelandic Journals by William Morris, an important literary influence on Tolkien.|$|E

5|$|Writing in 2009, Biran {{suggests}} that De Stem des Bloeds was clearly written from an Indo {{point of view}} because of the positive roles of Indo children. He finds the film sympathetic to native culture, including the faithful njai. He notes with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children were faced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of disgust, in De Stem des Bloeds an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman.|$|E
5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of urgency, had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
40|$|A new joint {{random access}} scheme is {{proposed}} to enable effective uplink access when users are partially aware of channel conditions in multichannel wireless systems. The proposed scheme mitigates packet collisions with joint backoff {{control in the}} time and frequency domains, cooperating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sensing</b> method that exploits the channel conditions. The performance analysis of the joint access scheme is facilitated by a Markov model that provides a closed-form throughput expression. Simulation results show that this channel access scheme, working together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simple <b>sensing</b> method, offers significant improvements to system throughput.

5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} soft drugs and {{then moved on to}} using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says {{he has never seen}} video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E

5|$|Islam has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 {{to raise awareness of}} the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten, and other information some of which was found to be falsified.|$|E
5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E

Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of tradition and solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s {{with the addition of}} the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The front wall of the middle tier {{is one of the last}} surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing. The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.|$|E

5|$|Biko's banning {{order in}} 1973 {{prevented}} him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped {{to set up a}} new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, David Russell. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing black people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black people who would not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E
