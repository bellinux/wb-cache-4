Upon the announcement that the song and music video were going to be released, Burke included the song on her set list of the Jingle Bell Ball concerts around the country, where other artists including Nicole Scherzinger, Olly Murs and The Wanted also performed.

500|$|SFScope's Sarah Stegall {{praised the}} writers for {{showcasing}} Peter, believing Jackson gave [...] "a solid, convincing performance that teaches {{us more about}} Peter than we learned {{in the first half}} of this season". She also was pleased with Peter's reactions to the obstacles thrown in his path, but criticized the writing for having another man behind the murders ('Too much coincidence. <b>Way</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> coincidence. From a plotting standpoint, it was clumsy'). Stegall concluded her review by praising all of the actors' performances, explaining that other than the [...] "clumsy" [...] killer plot twist, [...] "I had no complaints at all about this episode. The supporting cast was top notch". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed how the episode mystery was processed from Peter's point of view, and loved the revelation at the end about Walternate. MTV columnist Josh Wigler praised the episode's [...] "pretty mature storytelling" [...] for not making Peter [...] "go on an angry rampage" [...] or become [...] "an angsty ball of self-loathing" [...] after the previous episode's events. He continued, [...] "You can see that he's hurting, but he's still not quite sure how to process everything. Excellent work from the writers and Joshua Jackson".|$|E

The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat.

Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> now. No more high-range.

[...] Referring to the love triangle between Chance, Chloe and Heather, Nekeeta Borden (also writing for Zap2it) said, [...] "All things considered, will Chance and Chloe survive Hurricane Heather?"

She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime.

[...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry.

500|$|Come What(ever) May was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive critical reviews. Several reviewers noted how it helped to further establish Stone Sour.

Megan Frye of Allmusic opened her review of the album by distinguishing what sets Stone Sour apart musically, writing [...] " [...] ability to create smooth, radio-friendly alternative metal songs while simultaneously not boring {{the people who have}} heard <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> from post-grunge groups." [...] On a similar note, Michael Melchor of 411mania said, [...] "The band is much better at the craft of songwriting than many of their peers." [...] In contrast, reviewer William Fry of IGN criticized the album, writing, [...] "Stone Sour doesn't do anything inspired, original, or fresh here," [...] even calling the album [...] "completely misdirected, and stonewalled". A particular point of interest for reviewers was how Come What(ever) May is more melodic than the band's previous album Stone Sour. Melchor of 411mania said the album is [...] "much more liberal with the balladry and acoustic sounds than its predecessor"; of the track [...] "Sillyworld" [...] he said, [...] "It sounds like what Nickelback could be if Chad Kroeger could write a good melody." [...] In his review, Chad Bower labeled Come What(ever) May as a [...] "very melodic and accessible album" [...] writing that [...] "it has a little something for everyone". Similarly, Megan Frye praised the album as an [...] "unyielding effort from a promising talent".|$|E
500|$|The {{conclusion}} to [...] "Trinity War" [...] received an 8 out of 10 from Richard Gray of Newsarama. He said, [...] "It {{was clear from}} the start of “Trinity War” that this would only ever be a bridge between one phase and the next. By the final page of Justice League #23, that bridge is not so much burned as left a bit smokey from the waves of revelations that come to light in the issue’s final pages. It’s a fitting conclusion, but one that will require additional reading when the dust has settled." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources was critical of the final issue, giving it 3.5 stars out of 5. He felt that while [...] "Justice League #23 is a loud, clanging final chapter to the crossover between Justice League books", there [...] "was <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> is left hanging out to be completed elsewhere." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN was highly critical of Justice League #23, giving it a 6.0 out of 10. Schedeen felt that the Trinity of Sin [...] "are practically non-entities in the story" [...] at the end, after being teased as the center of the event back in 2012. He also felt the splash pages were overused and did not like lack of conclusion. Finally, he felt it was [...] "refreshing to see that Johns has been executing a long-term plan for the past two years" [...] and [...] "the highlight of this issue, and probably the crossover as a whole, is the reveal of the Justice League traitor."

500|$|On October 19, 2010, Scribner {{published}} {{a collection of}} short stories, Palo Alto, by Franco. The book is named after the California city where Franco grew up and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories Palo Alto, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, consists of life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who {{spend most of their time}} indulging in driving drunk, smoking weed and taking part in unplanned acts of violence. Each passage is told by a young narrator. The book has received mixed reviews; Los Angeles Times called it [...] "the work of an ambitious young man who clearly loves to read, who has a good eye for detail, but who has spent <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time on style and virtually none on substance". The Guardian said that Franco's [...] "foray into the literary world may be met with cynicism in some quarters, but this is a promising debut from a most unlikely source". Writing in The New York Times, reviewer and fellow author Joshua Mohr praised Franco for how, in the story [...] "American History", he juxtaposed historical parts with a present-day social commentary that [...] "makes the we wonder how much we've actually evolved in post-bellum America". At least one editor of a literary journal testified he would not publish Franco's stories, claiming he has been published due to his star power, not literary talent. Publishers Weekly reviewed the collection, stating [...] "The author fails to find anything remotely insightful to say in these 11 amazingly underwhelming stories".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E

Cristina Gibson of E! described the video as [...] "edgy", similar to Cyrus' video for [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", but [...] "on steroids". Tina Warren of MTV News said the video was a good step toward ridding Cyrus of her good-girl image and gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "intriguing" [...] and stating, [...] "The video [...] is actually quite magnetic and you can’t look away".
