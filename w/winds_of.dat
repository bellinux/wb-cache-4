5|$|According to the JTWC, {{the storm}} quickly reached 1-minute {{sustained}} <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 85km/h (50mph). The secondary disturbance {{to the west}} weakened while approaching the storm. Manou also weakened due to ongoing shear, and the windspeeds dropped as the circulation became exposed from the convection. On May6, the storm re-intensified and the thunderstorms redeveloped while passing north of Mauritius and Réunion. On May8 while approaching Madagascar, Manou developed an eye, and as a result, MFR upgraded it to tropical cyclone status, with 10-minute <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 120km/h (75mph). The JTWC also upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Manou intensified further, although its forward motion slowed significantly. MFR estimated peak 10-minute <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 155km/h (95mph) on May8, and JTWC estimated peak 1-minute <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 140km/h (85mph), with gusts to 165km/h (105mph). This made Manou a rare May tropical cyclone in the basin; only four other storms that formed in the south-west Indian Ocean in May reached <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> over 140km/h (85mph) since satellite coverage began, most recently Cyclone Kesiny in the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Early on September1, Hurricane Luis {{strengthened}} into a Category3 hurricane with <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 115mph (185km/h); upper-level outflow {{continued to}} improve throughout the day, allowing further intensification. Maintaining its structure, Luis further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane with <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 135mph (215km/h). Subsequent to doing so, its intensity remained steady for 42hours while it tracked nearly due west.

When Luis was about 690mi (1,110km) east of the Lesser Antilles, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight into the storm confirmed satellite intensity estimates. Flight level winds around the eye of Luis were recorded at 165mph (270km/h), which corresponds to surface <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 944mbar (27.87inHg).|$|E

Prapiroon maintained this intensity for 12hours before weakening slightly as it made landfall near Shangyang at 12:00UTC.

5|$|Should the {{tropical}} system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured, as greater than 64kn (74mph; 119km/h), {{then it will}} be called a hurricane and classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The lowest classification on the SSHWS is a Category 1 hurricane, which has <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> between 64–82kn (74–95mph, 119–153km/h). Should the hurricane intensify further {{then it will be}} rated as a Category 2 hurricane, if it has <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> between 83–95kn (96–110mph, 154–177km/h). When a system becomes a Category 3 hurricane with <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> between 96–112kn (111–129mph, 178–208km/h), it {{is considered to be a}} major hurricane by the warning centers.

A post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened, into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage. However, advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone, poses a significant threat to life and property. They may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hours.|$|E

5|$|After an {{extended}} period with no activity {{across much of the}} Indian Ocean, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) rebuilt toward the end of February, and spawned an area of convection on March1 in the extreme eastern portion of the basin. The next day, a circulation was noted on satellite imagery to the northeast of the convection, which indicated that a tropical disturbance had developed. The influence of the monsoon trough steered the disturbance to the southeast into the Australian basin, where moderate wind shear prevented quick development. A building ridge to the south turned the system to the southwest, bringing it back into the south-west Indian on March3 as a tropical depression. With decreasing wind shear, the depression slowly intensified as convection increased, becoming Tropical Storm Davina on March4. An eye developed the next day, signaling Davina had intensified into a tropical cyclone, or reaching 10-minute <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> at least 120km/h (75mph). On March7, Davina became an intense tropical cyclone, with sustained 10-minute <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> 165km/h (105mph).
