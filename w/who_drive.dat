She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E

25|$|Malaysian expressways are {{potential}} sites of fatal highway accidents in Malaysia, especially during festive seasons.

25|$|Persons {{performing}} any safety-sensitive task {{should not}} use opioids. Health care providers should not recommend that workers <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> or use heavy equipment including cranes or forklifts treat chronic or acute pain with opioids.

25|$|As {{with other}} {{hypnotic}} drugs, nitrazepam {{is associated with}} an increased risk of traffic accidents. Nitrazepam is recommended to be avoided in patients <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> or operate machinery. A study assessing driving skills of sedative hypnotic users found the users of nitrazepam to be significantly impaired up to 17 hours after dosing, whereas users of temazepam did not show significant impairments of driving ability. These results reflect the long-acting nature of nitrazepam.|$|E

In good weather during the summer months many cars can be seen taking in the views of the river and the Hudson Highlands here (however, this section can be gated off and closed in times of high rockslide danger).|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone causes {{impaired}} driving skills {{similar to}} those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> motor vehicles should not take zopiclone unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand eye coordination.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{there is}} no {{corresponding}} body of regulations applicable to U.S. workers who operate motor vehicles other than large trucks or buses {{as part of their}} job duties: i.e., those who operate lighter vehicles that are employer-owned or leased, or those <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> personal vehicles for work purposes. It is true that at-work drivers are covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) “general duty clause”, which requires that an employer provide “employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees”.|$|E

Associating with Silver Millennium was against Earth law, and Endymion violated this law when {{he fell in love}} with Princess Serenity. In this version of events, Serenity and Endymion are outlaws (similar to Romeo and Juliet) <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> an otherwise innocent woman, Beryl, to evil by making her jealous. Sailor Pluto also reveals that she is in love with Endymion, though she has contented herself with watching from afar.|$|E
25|$|Lancaster also hosts other Plain Anabaptist groups. As of 2000, {{there are}} about 3,000 Old Order Mennonites of the Groffdale Conference <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> black top buggies instead of the grey top buggies of the Amish in Lancaster county. Other buggy-using Old Order Mennonites in Lancaster County are subgroups of the Stauffer Mennonites with 283 baptized members and the Reidenbach Mennonites with 232. There are about 4,000 members of the car-driving Weaverland Old Order Mennonite Conference. A {{congregation}} of 83 members of the Old Order River Brethren lives there as well as 84 members of the Reformed Mennonite Church who have retained the most conservative form of Plain dress of all Plain groups. There are 74 members of the Old German Baptist Brethren in Lancaster County. The Amish comprise around 5.7% of the total population.|$|E
25|$|Harry becomes {{convinced}} that Jim Coaver (William Hope), Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Harry's partner during 1982, {{is responsible for}} the attacks. Harry abducts and interrogates Coaver, who denies any knowledge of the attacks. Coaver is surrendered to a group posing as CIA personnel, <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> away with him moments before the actual CIA officers arrive. When the MI5 team realise their mistake, they give chase. Coaver is pushed out of the rear of the speeding van during the pursuit and subsequently dies on the street. The CIA applies pressure on Home Secretary William Towers (Simon Russell Beale), as they believe Harry to be directly responsible for Coaver's death. They demand Harry be handed over to CIA custody for extradition to the United States. Harry urgently requests that Towers bring the signing of the agreement forward as quickly as possible.|$|E
