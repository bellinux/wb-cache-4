Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin. Giles Martin, with Jeff Lynne also remixed [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] to accompany the music video for the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The remix of [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] cleans up Lennon's vocal further, and uses a different take of Harrison's vocal phrase, replacing the lyric [...] "whatever happened to the life that <b>we</b> <b>once</b> knew" [...] with [...] "whatever happened to love that <b>we</b> <b>once</b> knew". Towards {{the end of the}} track, this version also contains a clip of Lennon stating the phrase [...] "turned out nice again" [...] played forward—which was played backwards in the original mix of the song. McCartney's lead vocal, buried in the original mix to serve as a double-track for Lennon's own vocal, can now [...] be heard more prominently in the second verse.|$|E
500|$|In 1832, the {{exhibition}} of Etty's Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm {{had led to}} significant criticism {{in some parts of}} the press for its use of nude figures, with The Morning Chronicle condemning it as an [...] "indulgence of what <b>we</b> <b>once</b> hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind". When it was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1833, Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret received much more favourable treatment.|$|E

500|$|The {{greatest}} {{criticism of}} Youth and Pleasure came from The Morning Chronicle, a newspaper which had long disliked Etty's female nudes. It complained [...] "no decent family can hang such sights against their wall", and condemned the painting as an [...] "indulgence of what <b>we</b> <b>once</b> hoped a classical, but {{which are now}} convinced, is a lascivious mind", commenting [...] "the course of [...] studies should run in a purer channel, {{and that he should}} not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth." [...] The reviewer added [...] "we fear that Mr.E will never turn from his wicked ways, and make himself fit for decent company." ...|$|E
500|$|Walter Jackson Bate {{states that}} the poem has [...] "always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far better.

Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, <b>we</b> <b>once</b> more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{observed}} that Trott continually stood in one place, showing {{little interest in}} events around him. [...] A doctor noted on Trott's file: [...] "Refuses to converse not appearing {{to be able to}} follow what is said to him. Answers questions in monosyllables. Does not rouse up when subjects are spoken of that formerly he was interested in." [...] Attempting to reach him, doctors sent Trott to play cricket, which he did in a [...] "mechanical, indifferent fashion". In a departure from normal hospital procedure, he was allowed newspapers reporting the details of Darling's Australian side in England; this left him unmoved. Trott's friend Ben Wardill, the secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, visited in November 1899 but Trott did not recognise him. [...] A fellow patient, when released, wrote of Trott: [...] "Here is a well-known cricketer, whom <b>we</b> <b>once</b> treated as a hero. [...] But alas! Like everything else, times have changed and he is almost forgotten." ...|$|E

500|$|The Bard {{was about}} the English {{destruction}} of Welsh culture and the subsequent decline of the House of Plantagenet and its replacement by the Welsh House of Tudor, {{and there was a}} general feeling among critics that Etty had misunderstood the point of the metaphors used by Gray. Etty claimed that his unusual interpretation of the text was intended to create [...] "a general allegory of Human Life, its empty vain pleasures—if not founded on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages", and that the painting served as a moral warning about the pursuit of empty pleasure. This explanation appears to have left critics unconvinced. Even those critics most favourable towards Etty's technical accomplishments in creating the picture found it hard to ascertain what the painting was supposed to represent; other critics were more openly hostile, with The Morning Chronicle condemning it as [...] "indulgence of what <b>we</b> <b>once</b> hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind". Purchased for a huge sum by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, Youth and Pleasure remained controversial long after Etty's death, with Farr's 1958 biography describing it as [...] "singularly inept".|$|E
500|$|The Romanian writer {{also spent}} the Dada period issuing {{a long series}} of manifestos, which were often {{authored}} as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by [...] "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected [...] "the language of a sophisticated savage". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for [...] "compress what we think and feel", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre [...] "suited Tzara perfectly." [...] Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: [...] "Dada means nothing", adding [...] "Thought is produced in the mouth." [...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that [...] "as long as we do things the way we think <b>we</b> <b>once</b> did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society." ...|$|E

The similar point of view, in the same battle, is emphasized in the novel [...] "Corpse bearer" [...] (Finnish: Kylmien kyytimies) by Antti Tuuri from 2007. Jenni Linturi's multilayered Malmi 1917 (2013) describes contradictory emotions and attitudes in a village drifting to civil war. Väinö Linna's trilogy turned the general tide, and several books were written mainly {{from the point of view}} of the Red side in 1918: e.g. Tampere-trilogy by Erkki Lepokorpi in 1977, Juhani Syrjä's [...] "John" [...] (Finnish: Juho) in 1998, [...] "The Command" [...] (Finnish: Käsky) by Leena Lander in 2003 and Sandra by Heidi Köngäs 2017.

[...] On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral Simpsons characters, IGN's Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the Simpsons universe [...] "as the town's brilliant mad scientist." [...] They highlighted a scene from the episode [...] "The PTA Disbands", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children [...] "wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels" [...] as he did. Nick Griffiths of Radio Times named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has [...] "always loved Professor Frink", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word [...] "the", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly. The Sydney Morning Heralds David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of [...] "TV's great tech figures", writing that apart from being smart, the professor {{is best known for his}} [...] "rather idiosyncratic speech patterns— hmmguyvin-whey-hey."

500|$|Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan {{rated the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and applauded {{the return of}} Duchovny, writing, [...] "welcome back, [...] you {{magnificent}} bastard." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a mixed review of the episode. On one hand, he praised {{the feel of the}} episode, writing, [...] "in many ways, this was an episode that brought back the intensity, magic, and the power of The X-Files that I have been missing throughout this most mundane of seasons." [...] In this manner, Kessenich felt that Doggett became [...] "part of The X-Files for the first time." [...] However, Kessenich also felt that the plot involving Mulder's terminal brain disease was a mis-step, noting that Mulder would have never kept something so serious and personal from Scully. He wrote, [...] "a year ago, Mulder was not dying [...] what <b>we</b> <b>once</b> knew as truth has suddenly been replaced with a lie." [...] George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times called the entry [...] "one of the season's more engaging episodes" [...] and wrote positively of the [...] "intriguing possibilities" [...] that it set up for the final part of the season. They were also positive about the manner in which Doggett and Mulder were able to connect in [...] "some mystical way". However, Avalos and Liedtke were critical of the episode's placement, noting that it would have worked better had it been the [...] "fourth or fifth episode of the season", as opposed to the eighth. Furthermore, they negatively wrote about the revelation that Mulder was suffering from a terminal brain disease, calling it a [...] "monumental story" [...] curve that did not bother [...] "to connect all the dots behind" [...] it.|$|E

It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life.
