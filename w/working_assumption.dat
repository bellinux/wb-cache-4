They simply chose to believe this was the explanation for various anomalous, but mundane, conditions they were experiencing. Those who do have memories of alien abduction, Clancy found to have undergone either hypnosis or other kinds of processes known to distort memories or to create false memories.

5000|$|C. E. Nelson {{argued for}} a common {{archetype}} (from which all the ballads derive), composed around the year 1700 by [...] "a literate individual of antiquarian bent" [...] living in Berwickshire.

Localizing the archetype to Berwickshire is natural, since the Greenwood group of ballads that closely abide by the romance belong to this area, and it is the [...] "home area" [...] of the traditional hero, Thomas of Erceldoune.

In the future, the basis of competition for security products and services will be the ability to provide early warnings and execute countermeasures that minimize damage from cyber-attackers. The problem is not about single or even multiple independent security devices each providing some amount of absolute protection. Rather, information from all your security products and services need to be correlated, scrutinized and transformed into wide-angle actionable information in order to minimize the most likely threats of damage by cyber-attackers in your specific enterprise environment, see Figure 3. We call this approach the “Fabric of Security.” It is a layered model that easily accommodates distributed deployment of security in multi-vendor environments.|$|E

5000|$|His {{contributions}} {{to this area}} are numerous. The famous Riemann mapping theorem says that a simply connected domain in the complex plane is [...] "biholomorphically equivalent" [...] (i.e. there is a bijection between them that is holomorphic with a holomorphic inverse) to either [...] or to {{the interior of the}} unit circle. The generalization of the theorem to Riemann surfaces is the famous uniformization theorem, which was proved in the 19th century by Henri Poincaré and Felix Klein. Here, too, rigorous proofs were first given after the development of richer mathematical tools (in this case, topology). For the proof of the existence of functions on Riemann surfaces he used a minimality condition, which he called the Dirichlet principle. Weierstrass found a gap in the proof: Riemann had not noticed that his <b>working</b> <b>assumption</b> (that the minimum existed) might not work; the function space might not be complete, and therefore the existence of a minimum was not guaranteed. Through the work of David Hilbert in the Calculus of Variations, the Dirichlet principle was finally established. Otherwise, Weierstrass was very impressed with Riemann, especially with his theory of abelian functions. When Riemann's work appeared, Weierstrass withdrew his paper from Crelle's Journal and did not publish it. They had a good understanding when Riemann visited him in Berlin in 1859. Weierstrass encouraged his student Hermann Amandus Schwarz to find alternatives to the Dirichlet principle in complex analysis, in which he was successful. An anecdote from Arnold Sommerfeld shows the difficulties which contemporary mathematicians had with Riemann's new ideas. In 1870, Weierstrass had taken Riemann's dissertation with him on a holiday to Rigi and complained that it was hard to understand. The physicist Hermann von Helmholtz assisted him in the work over night and returned with the comment that it was [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "very understandable".|$|E
5000|$|Both Georgiev and Duridanov use the {{comparative}} linguistic method to decipher ancient Thracian and Dacian names, respectively. Georgiev (1977) {{argues that the}} meaning of an ancient placename in an unknown language can be deciphered by comparing it to its successor-names and to cognate placenames and words in other Indo-European languages, both ancient and modern. Georgiev considers decipherment by analysis of root-words alone to be devoid of scientific value. He gives several examples of his methodology, one of which refers to a town and river (a tributary of the Danube) in eastern Romania called Cernavodă, which in Slavic means [...] "black water". The same town in antiquity was known as Ἀξίοπα (Axiopa) or Ἀξιούπολις (Axioupolis) and its river as the Ἀξιός (Axios). The <b>working</b> <b>assumption</b> is that Axiopa meant [...] "black water" [...] in Dacian, {{on the basis that}} Cernavodă is probably a loan-translation of the ancient Dacian name. According to Georgiev, the likely IE root-word for Axios is *n̥-ks(e)y-no ("dark, black" [...] cf. Avestan axsaena). On the basis of the known rules of formation of IE composite words, Axiopa would break down as axi = [...] "black" [...] and opa or upa = [...] "water" [...] in Dacian; the -polis element is ignored, as it is a Greek suffix meaning [...] "city". The assumption is then validated by examining cognate placenames. There was another Balkan river also known in antiquity as Axios, whose source was in the Dacian-speaking region of Moesia: its modern Macedonian name is Crna reka (Slavic for [...] "black river"): although it was in Dardania (Rep. of Macedonia), a mainly Illyrian-speaking region. Georgiev considers this river-name to be of Daco-Moesian origin. The axi element is also validated by the older Greek name for the Black Sea, Ἄξεινος πόντος - Axeinos pontos, later altered to the euphemism Εὔξεινος πόντος Euxeinos pontos meaning [...] "Hospitable sea". The opa/upa element is validated by the Lithuanian cognate upė, or Romanian [...] "apa", meaning [...] "water"). The second component of the town's name *-upolis may be a diminutive of *upa cf. Lithuanian diminutive upelis.|$|E
5000|$|Hume is thus left {{endorsing}} a moral sentimentalism {{somewhat like}} that of Hutcheson: [...] "Morality... is more properly felt than judg'd of". The moral evaluations in our mind are impressions—"nothing but particular pains or pleasures"—and Hume's task is to explain how certain kinds of [...] "action, or sentiment, or character" [...] produce these special moral sentiments in us. But a problem arises: since pleasant or painful feelings can be produced by inanimate objects, why doesn't sentimentalism succumb to the same objection Hume has just raised against rationalism? First, he contends {{there are many different}} kinds of pleasure and pain, and that the moral sentiments (which arise [...] "only when a character is consider'd in general, without reference to our particular interest") have a distinctive feeling, noticeably different than the feelings called up by inanimate objects (or matters of self-interest). Second, he reminds us that the four indirect passions are produced by pleasant or unpleasant qualities in ourselves or other persons, not inanimate objects. This objection dispatched, Hume closes with two points about the psychological origin of moral sentiments. First, on the <b>working</b> <b>assumption</b> that nature tends to produce variety from [...] "a few principles", he hopes to find [...] "general principles" [...] underlying our moral psychology. Second, {{to the question of whether}} these principles are [...] "natural", he replies that it depends on the meaning of [...] "natural": they are not miraculous, nor are they rare, but they might sometimes draw on human artifice (his system will include both natural virtues and artificial virtues), adding that none of these meanings can sustain the popular view (defended by Butler) that [...] "virtue is the same with what is natural, and vice with what is unnatural". Before proceeding to his detailed examination of moral psychology, Hume takes a parting shot at moral rationalism and its [...] "incomprehensible relations and qualities, which never did exist in nature, nor even in our imagination, by any clear and distinct conception".|$|E
