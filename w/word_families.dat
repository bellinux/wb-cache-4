500|$|Greenlandic {{vocabulary}} {{is mostly}} inherited from Proto-Eskimo–Aleut, {{but it has}} also taken a large number of loans from other languages, especially from Danish. Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word palasi [...] "priest" [...] is a loan from the Danish [...] "præst". But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. qarasaasiaq [...] "computer" [...] which literally means [...] "artificial brain". This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large <b>word</b> <b>families.</b> For example the root for [...] "tongue" [...] oqaq is used to derive the following words: ...|$|E
2500|$|Leitner sabotages {{conventional}} ways {{of verse}} construction by a systematic {{usage of the}} enjambment, whereby he attains a multiple coding of his lines with meaning. , for example, highlighted this procedure during a discussion of Leitner's poem Abends, immer in Die Welt: [...] "Anton G. Leitner's poem Abends, immer offers interesting material exemplifying an extreme form of the enjambment: here the line breaks frequently give the poem an entirely new direction. In the beginning, Leitner's poem seems to bring us into a car: 'Preferably, // he lay / obliquely. She // stands up.' A dialog full of tensions may be implied here, but also a change of position – of the erotic type." [...] By dramatically [...] "shattering the relations of sentences and individual words" [...] in his poems, he creates the effect of estrangement, the conventional usage of language and images within everyday language is opened to new interpretations. In combination with an extremely condensed language, Leitner's poetic approach {{has proven to be}} exceptionally productive in bringing contemporary phenomena into the domains of verse: [...] "His verse mimics the high velocity of contemporary experience in the meters of a new age – no word, no syllable, no character too much." [...] "Leitner relentlessly works with chiastic and superimposed semantic vectors that are capable of producing paradoxical and bamboozling effects. He frequently mixes <b>word</b> <b>families,</b> crosses through boundaries of word fields, splices word compounds, contrives unusual sequences of associations, and shatters those which we might expect." ...|$|E

40|$|The article {{provides}} comprehensive justification {{of the principles}} and methods of the synchronic and diachronic research of word-formation subsystems of the Russian language. The authors also study the ways of analyzing historical dynamics of <b>word</b> <b>family</b> as the main macro-unit of word-formation system. In the field of analysis there is a <b>family</b> of <b>words</b> with the stem 'ход-' (the meaning of 'motion'), word-formation of which is investigated in different periods of the Russian literary language. Significance of motion-verbs {{in the process of}} forming a language picture of the world determined the character and the structure of this <b>word</b> <b>family</b> as one of the biggest {{in the history of the}} Russian language. In the article a structural and semantic dynamics of the <b>word</b> <b>family</b> 'ход-' is depicted. The results of the study show that in the ancient period the prefixes of verbal derivatives were formed, which became the apex-branched derivational paradigms existing in modern Russian. The old Russian period of language development is characterized by the appearance of words with connotative meaning (with suffixes -ishk-, -ichn-), as well as the words with possessive semantics (with suffixes –ev-, -sk-). In this period the verbs with the postfix -cz also supplement the analyzed <b>word</b> <b>family.</b> The period of formation of the National Russian language was marked by the loss of a large number of abstract nouns and the appearance of neologisms from some old Russian abstract nouns. The studied family in the modern Russian language is characterized by the following processes: the appearance of terms, the active semantic derivation, the weakening of word-formation variability, the semantic differentiation of duplicate units, the development of subsystem of words with connotative meanings, and the preservation of derivatives in all functional styles...|$|R
