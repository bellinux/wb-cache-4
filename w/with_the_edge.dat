5|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} Achtung Baby {{was marked by}} several {{releases}} in 2011. At the band's request, a documentary film about the album entitled From the Sky Down was produced. It was directed by Davis Guggenheim, who previously collaborated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> for the documentary It Might Get Loud in 2008. From the Sky Down documents the album's difficult recording period, the band members' relationships, and U2's creative process. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from Rattle and Hum. For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios and during rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, and in October, it was broadcast on multiple television networks worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The chapel is unrealistically small {{compared}} to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The panel {{is one of three}} surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate The Madonna Standing.|$|E

5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E

25|$|A {{rail spike}} is roughly chisel-shaped {{and with a}} flat edged point; the spike is driven <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> {{perpendicular}} to the grain, which gives greater resistance to loosening.

25|$|The rise in {{popularity}} of katana amongst samurai came about {{due to the}} changing nature of close-combat warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. The katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (obi) with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved tachi had been worn <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the blade facing down and suspended from a belt.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} the peace terms {{probably}} offered by the Frisians to the Danes, but the Frisians were very submissive in the deal.

The defenders are also to be given half of a new building, which, confusingly they are to share with Finn and the eotena sons (see below), and also to be given feasts and treasure by Finn. The concessions by Finn may reflect his remorse at the events, or it may have been seen as a suitable weregild for the defenders not avenging the killing of Hnæf. The Beowulf poet describes how Finn stuck to his oath by giving treasure.|$|E
25|$|In November 2015, {{two films}} about the tour were {{scheduled}} to air on American television network HBO, but both were postponed. The first was a concert film entitled Innocence + Experience: Live in Paris, originally planned for airing on 14 November to showcase a performance at AccorHotels Arena in Paris from earlier that day. However, the terrorist attacks in Paris the day prior forced U2's performance and the broadcast to be postponed until 7 December. The concert was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and via digital download on 10 June 2016. The second film, a behind-the-scenes tour documentary featuring interviews with the band and tour personnel, was originally scheduled to air on 7 November, a week prior to the original concert broadcast date, {{but it was also}} postponed. The documentary was slated to be directed by Davis Guggenheim, who previously worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> for the documentary It Might Get Loud (2008) and with U2 for From the Sky Down (2011).|$|E

25|$|In 1952, the OSUMB {{formally}} ended {{ties with}} the ROTC department. Around the same time, the Lily Ames Co., the last supplier of OSU-specific ROTC uniforms, closed its doors. OSU bought the remaining uniforms from Lily Ames. The band had custom patches sewn on to the jacket shoulders. Rank insignia was also removed from the band uniforms. The right shoulder held a gray circular patch with a red Buckeye leaf and {{around the edge of}} the patch read: The Ohio State University Buckeyes. The left shoulder patch was a miniature of The Ohio State University seal. The patch was red <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> reading: The Ohio State University -Columbus-. During this time, Tau Beta Sigma, the national honorary band sorority, became active in the OSUMB as well, even though women were not permitted to be in the band on the field. At this point, all of the sisters of the sorority were given unique uniforms. The sisters wore the same jacket, shirt, and tie as the band members. The sisters wore long military-style dress skirts, hose, and female style military dress shoes. The sisters wore their ΤΒΣ recognition bar (identical to the fraternity version) on their uniforms. Women could fulfill roles with the band as secretaries and librarians, but were not permitted to march.|$|E
25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E

500|$|With {{respect to}} infrageneric {{classification}} (i.e., taxonomic ranking {{below the level}} of genus) in Mycena, several characteristics suggest the mushroom fits best in Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus' section Fragilipedes: the ellipsoidal, amyloid spores; dextrinoid spore-bearing tissue; smooth cheilocystidia; gills <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> the same colour as the face; and the non-slimy, distinctly coloured cap. According to the 1986 infrageneric classification proposed by Rolf Singer, the mushroom would be classified in subgenus Mycena, subsection Ciliatae, [...] Alcalina (roughly equivalent to section Fragilipedes of Maas Geesteranus) because of the amyloid spores, smooth, elongated cheilocystidia, dull-coloured pigment, and stem without either latex or a slimy sheath. Grgurinovic erected the new section Nargan to accommodate M.nargan, because its scales, lack of coarse fibrils {{at the base of the}} stem, and lack of [...] coating meant it was not a good fit for section Fragilipedes.|$|E
