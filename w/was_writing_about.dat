While replicating the electrical experiments, some unanswered questions prompted Priestly to design additional experiments, leading to additional discoveries. In 1767 he published a 700-page book on his findings called The History and Present State of Electricity.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} novel has been {{acclaimed}} in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> a Brazilian theme.

25|$|In Book I Thomas {{addresses}} Froude's {{claims in}} the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping generalizations {{about the condition of}} blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about.</b> Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses as he rode past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.|$|E
25|$|In May 1926 Weston {{signed a}} {{contract}} with writer Anita Brenner for $1,000 to make photographs for a book she <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> Mexican folk art. In June he, Modotti and Brett started traveling around the country in search of lesser known native arts and crafts. His contract required him to give Brenner three finished prints from 400 8x10 negatives, and it took him until November of that year to complete the work. During their travels, Brett received a crash course in photography from his father, and he made more than two dozen prints that his father judged to be of exceptional quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{brochure}} {{was used}} as an advertising leaflet for the Boca Grande Hotel and was freely distributed to guests. In 1923, a Boston historian named Francis B. C. Bradlee received a copy of the brochure and, assuming that the story was true, included José Gaspar in a book that he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> piracy, Piracy In The West Indies And Its Suppression. His book {{was used as}} a source for later works such as Philip Gosse's Pirates' Who's Who and Frederick W. Dau's Florida Old and New, the authors of which also took Gaspar's authenticity for granted. Over the next few decades, several more books about pirates or Florida history erroneously included José Gaspar / Gasparilla as a real historical figure.|$|E

25|$|As a cricket writer, he {{generally}} concentrated on {{bringing out the}} character of the players that he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about,</b> and he made liberal use of humour. In these characteristics, and in that his cricket memories went back as far as {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, he might be compared with Neville Cardus, though Thomson was writing from a Yorkshire rather than a Lancashire perspective. He once said that cricket had given him more unalloyed pleasure over a longer period than anything else, and that pleasure was evident in his writing. Thomson saw cricket not only as the most pleasurable of pastimes but also quite like the Poet Laureate might see it—an eternally vibrant display of colour, spirit, humour and conflict.|$|E
25|$|Sima {{himself in}} the {{conclusion}} to chapter 110 of the Shiji declared {{that he was a}} writing in this tradition where he stated:“When Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, he was very open in treating the reigns of Yin and Huan, the early dukes of Lu; but {{when he came to the}} later period of Dukes Ding and Ai, his writing was much more covert. Because in the latter case he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> his own times, he did not express his judgements frankly, but used subtle and guarded language.” Bearing this in mind, not everything that Sima wrote should be understood as conveying didactical moral lessons. But several historians have suggested that parts of the Shiji, such as where Sima placed his section on Confucius’s use of indirect criticism in the part of the book dealing with the Xiongnu “barbarians” might indicate his disapproval of the foreign policy of the Emperor Wu.|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E

500|$|The writer Simon Winder {{believes}} that because Fleming <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> Jamaica, {{the result was}} [...] "perhaps the most attractive of all the Bond books—the most relaxed, the most fiendish, the most confident". According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th century British spy novels, Fleming knew his outdated view of Jamaica would soon be overtaken by events—as evidenced by the novel's description of how the Queen's Club would be lost during independence struggles. According to the cultural historian Michael Denning, this acknowledgement of the end-of-empire leads to a [...] "sense of doom" [...] that {{is the result of}} [...] "a shadow of real history hanging over the stories".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris claimed Kate Hudson's {{influence}} on his lyrics was subtle: [...] "More so than a literal reference to her, it's {{the vantage point}} from where I'm writing. [...] It's the reasons that I'm singing and it's the feeling. [...] That is an influence far greater than the literal influence." [...] He did grant, however, that [...] "Soul Singing" [...] and [...] "Miracle to Me" [...] were written with Hudson in mind, and explained that the album's track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own. [...] Producer Don Was said of Chris, [...] "I realized he was taking on something that was significant. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> becoming a man... There's {{a lot of old}} man/young man symbolism that's a self-conversation... I don't know that anyone has actually chronicled being 33 [...] as well as this album." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to {{the world in which we}} live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about,</b> {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Meyers {{writes that}} Hemingway {{was very clear}} about the husband's role, because in this story he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> a {{familiar}} subject—the experiences of his boyhood in Michigan. The young father's role is to [...] "deflate the doctor", who finds victory in slicing open the woman's belly to deliver the infant, {{and to provide a}} counterpoint to the mother's strength and resilience. The father's suicide serves as a symbolic rejection of the white doctor whose skill is necessary, but who brings with him destruction. In her paper [...] "Screaming Through Silence: The Violence of Race in 'Indian Camp'", Amy Strong writes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] is about domination; the husband kills himself at the moment his wife is cut open by a white doctor. She thinks the theme of domination exists on more than one level: Nick is dominated by his father; the white outsiders dominate in the Indian camp; and the white doctor [...] "has cut into the woman, like the early settlers leaving a gash in the tree." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the term}} {{alternative}} rock came into common usage around 1990, {{the sort of}} music to which it refers was known {{by a variety of}} terms. In 1979, Terry Tolkin used the term Alternative Music to describe the groups he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about.</b> In 1979 Dallas radio station KZEW had a late night new wave show entitled [...] "Rock and Roll Alternative". [...] "College rock" [...] was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the college radio circuit and the tastes of college students. In the United Kingdom, dozens of small do it yourself record labels emerged {{as a result of the}} punk subculture. According to the founder of one of these labels, Cherry Red, NME and Sounds magazines published charts based on small record stores called [...] "Alternative Charts". The first national chart based on distribution called the Indie Chart was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term indie was used literally to describe independently distributed records. By 1985, indie had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E
