5|$|Count Zrinski {{found himself}} besieged by a hostile army {{of at least}} 150,000 {{soldiers}} <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> artillery. Zrinski had assembled a force of around 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers prior to the siege. These consisted of his personal forces and those {{of his friends and}} allies. The majority of the defenders were Croatian, with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the men-at-arms and the leadership.|$|E
5|$|In April 1863, food {{shortages}} led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. Perhaps even more seriously, he clashed <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.|$|E

5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited a faint sodium tail, only visible <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Hale–Bopp's sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms (not ions), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.|$|E

5|$|The GDR {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} security measures along its Baltic coastline to hinder escape attempts. Camping and access to boats was severely limited and 27 watchtowers were built along the Baltic coastline. If a suspected escape attempt was spotted, high-speed patrol boats would be dispatched to intercept the fugitives. Armed patrols equipped <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> mobile searchlights monitored the beaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff was}} then hidden deep below the castle and inscribed <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> magical symbols to protect it. Before he died, Karnath broke the key into sixteen pieces and hid them {{throughout}} his castle. Centuries later, an aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, ventures inside the castle {{in order to}} defuse the orb before midnight. Should he fail, its power would be unleashed, and the resulting inter-dimensional rip would wipe out the human race.|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> {{cytotoxic}} venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} time of his union with Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. <b>With</b> <b>powerful</b> {{maritime}} forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly been regarded as an important potential ally. Clear evidence of an alliance between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such an alliance is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles at about the turn of the twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Rhine Campaign of 1796, Austria had two armies in Germany, the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. The left wing of the 80,000-man Army of the Upper Rhine guarded the Rhine River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé while its right wing was on the west bank around Kaiserslautern. The Army of the Lower Rhine had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The archduke's remaining 70,000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water <b>with</b> <b>powerful</b> thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
