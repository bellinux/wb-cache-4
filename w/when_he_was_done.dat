The Liberal Party leader {{tried to make}} an issue {{of the fact that}} Diefenbaker had called a winter election, {{generally}} disfavoured in Canada due to travel difficulties. Pearson's objection cut little ice with voters, and served only to remind the electorate that the Liberals, at their convention, had called for an election. Pearson mocked Diefenbaker's northern plans as [...] "igloo-to-igloo" [...] communications, and was assailed by the Prime Minister for being condescending. The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> By election day, Pearson had no illusions that he might win the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats. The Liberals would be limited to less than half of that.|$|E
