60|$|We {{have had}} {{a touch of the}} equinox, and the Leman has been in a foam, but its {{miniature}} anger, though terrible enough at times, to those who are embarked on its waters, can never rise to the dignity of a surf and a rolling sea. The rain kept me housed, and old John and I seized the occasion to convert a block of pine into a Leman bark, for P----. The next day proving fair, our vessel, fitted with two latine sails, and carrying a <b>weather</b> <b>helm,</b> was committed to the waves, and away she went, on a wind, toward the opposite shore. P----, of course, was delighted, and clapped his hands, until, perceiving that it was getting off the land, he compelled us to enter the boat and give chase. A chase it was, truly; for the little thing went skipping from wave, to wave, in such a business-like manner, that I once thought it would {{go all the way to}} Savoy. Luckily a flaw caused it to tack, when it soon became our prize. We were a long distance off when the boat was overtaken, and I thought the views behind the town finer, at that position, than when nearer in. I was particularly struck with the appearance of the little chateau of Blonay, which is still the residence of a family of the same name, that has been seated, for more than seven centuries, on the same rocky terrace. I was delighted to hear that its present owner is a liberal, as every ancient gentleman should be.

6000|$|In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco {{there are}} some crack sailors. I know, because I heard them pass {{judgment}} on the Snark {{during the process of}} her building. They found only one vital thing the matter with her, and on this they were all agreed, namely, that she could not run. She was all right in every particular, they said, except that I'd never be able to run her before it in a stiff wind and sea. [...] "Her lines," [...] they explained enigmatically, [...] "it is the fault of her lines. She simply cannot be made to run, that is all." [...] Well, I wish I'd only had those crack sailors of the Bohemian Club on board the Snark the other night for them to see for themselves their one, vital, unanimous judgment absolutely reversed. Run? It is the one thing the Snark does to perfection. Run? She ran with a sea-anchor fast for'ard and a full mizzen flattened down aft. Run? At the present moment, as I write this, we are bowling along before it, at a six-knot clip, in the north-east trades. Quite a tidy bit of sea is running. There is nobody at the wheel, the wheel is not even lashed and is set over a half-spoke <b>weather</b> <b>helm.</b> To be precise, the wind is north-east; the Snark's mizzen is furled, her mainsail is over to starboard, her head-sheets are hauled flat: and the Snark's course is south-south-west. And yet there are men who have sailed the seas for forty years and who hold that no boat can run before it without being steered. They'll call me a liar when they read this; it's what they called Captain Slocum when he said the same of his Spray.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Weather</b> <b>helm</b> is the {{tendency}} of sailing vessels to turn towards the source of wind, creating an unbalanced helm that requires pulling the tiller to windward (i.e. 'to weather') in order to counteract the effect. <b>Weather</b> <b>helm</b> {{is the opposite of}} lee helm.|$|E

50|$|Whilst reaching, the CE {{being set}} further back, will {{encourage}} a small craft to bear {{up into the}} wind, i.e. strong <b>weather</b> <b>helm.</b> The boat builder can compensate for this at design stage, e.g. by shifting the keel slightly aft, or having two jibs to counter the effect. The gaff-cutter {{is in fact a}} very popular sailplan for small craft. The helmsman can reduce <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> significantly, simply by sheeting out the mainsail. Sheeting out may appear to create an inefficient belly in the sail, but it is often a pragmatic alternative to having a heavy helm. A swing keel lifted halfway is the perfect treatment for <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> on a gaffer. The usual adjustments to mast rake, or even bowsprit length may be made to a gaffer with persistent heavy weather (or lee) helm.|$|E
5000|$|A slight {{amount of}} <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> is thought by some sailors to be a {{desirable}} situation, {{both from the}} standpoint of the [...] "feel" [...] of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm. <b>Weather</b> <b>helm</b> also provides a form of dead man's switch - the boat stops safely in irons if the helm is released for a length of time.|$|E
50|$|In some sailboats, the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} keel has a trim tab which is used to null out rudder forces (lee or <b>weather</b> <b>helm).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} of the aerodynamic center {{of pressure on the}} sails to the hydrodynamic center of pressure (referred to as the center of lateral resistance) on the hull determines the behavior of the boat in the wind. This behavior is known as the [...] "helm" [...] and is either a <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> or lee helm. A slight amount of <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both {{from the standpoint of the}} [...] "feel" [...] of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails.

50|$|The {{increasingly}} asymmetric underwater {{shape of}} the hull matching the increasing angle of heel may generate an increasing directional turning force into the wind. The sails' centre of effort will also increase this turning effect or force on the vessel's motion due to increasing lever effect with increased heeling which shows itself as increased human effort required to steer a straight course. Increased heeling reduces exposed sail area relative to the wind direction, so leading to an equilibrium state. As more heeling force causes more heel, <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> may be experienced. This condition has a braking effect on the vessel but has the safety effect in that an excessively hard pressed boat will try and turn into the wind, therefore, reducing the forces on the sail. Small amounts (≤5 degrees) of <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> are generally considered desirable because of the consequent aerofoil lift effect from the rudder. This aerofoil lift produces helpful motion to windward & the corollary {{of the reason why}} lee helm is dangerous. Lee helm, the opposite of <b>weather</b> <b>helm,</b> is generally considered to be dangerous because the vessel turns away from the wind when the helm is released, thus increasing forces on the sail {{at a time when the}} helmsperson is not in control.|$|E
50|$|Any {{action that}} reduces the angle of heel of a boat that is {{reaching}} or beating to windward will help reduce <b>weather</b> <b>helm.</b> Racing sailors use their body weight to bring the boat to a more upright position. Reducing or reefing the total sail area {{will have the same}} effect and, counter-intuitively, many boats will sail faster with less sail in a stiff breeze once heel and <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> have been reduced, due to the reduction in underwater drag (see Over-canvassed sailing). Easing the sheets on aft-most sails, such as the mainsail in a sloop or cutter can have an immediate effect, especially to help with manoeuvering. Moving or increasing sail area forward can also help, for example by raising the jib (and maybe lowering the staysail) on a cutter.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a vessel}} is heeling, the lee {{side of the}} hull is more under water than the weather side. The {{resulting}} shape of the submerged part of the hull in this condition usually creates a force (a turning moment) that pushes the bow to weather {{so that it is}} necessary to pull the tiller to weather to counteract this force. Since a <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> requires pulling the rudder through the water at an angle to the intended course, it produces drag and retards the boat's progress through the water. In the book [...] "Sailing Illustrated", Patrick M. Royce defines <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> as simply a [...] "heeling sailboat wanting to come head to wind." [...] The principle is the same whether the vessel is steered by tiller or wheel; turning the wheel leeward gives the same rudder effect as pulling a tiller windward.|$|E
5000|$|Lee helm is the {{tendency}} of a sailboat {{to turn away from}} the wind while under sail. It is the opposite of <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> which is {{the tendency}} of a sailboat to [...] "round up" [...] into the wind. A boat with lee helm will be difficult to sail Close Hauled and tacking may be difficult.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{cause of}} [...] "helm", be it weather or lee, {{is the relationship}} of the center of pressure of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull.

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{cause of}} [...] "helm", be it weather or lee, {{is the relationship}} of the center of pressure of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull. If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, a <b>weather</b> <b>helm,</b> the tendency of the vessel to want to turn into the wind, or to weather-vane, will result.|$|E
5000|$|The two cruisers {{were good}} sea boats, and were very maneuverable.

50|$|Sail twist is a {{phenomenon}} in sailing where {{the head of the}} sail is at a different angle of incidence from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. Twist is measured by comparing the angle of a straight line between the leading edge (luff) and trailing edge (leech) with that of the boom. Some twist is desirable, but too much can induce <b>weather</b> <b>helm</b> or ruin the slot between the mainsail and jib.|$|E
