5|$|This line of {{occupation}} of Britain was consolidated {{as one of}} the limites (defensible frontiers) of the empire by its construction. It is a stone fortification built across the width of what is now northern England. The <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 80 Roman miles (73.5 statute miles or 117 kilometres) long, its width and height dependent on the construction materials which were available nearby. East of the River Irthing the <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> made from squared stone and measured 3metres (9.7ft) wide and 5–6 metres (16–20ft) high, while west of the river the <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> originally made from turf and measured 6metres (20ft) wide and 3.5metres (11.5ft) high; it was subsequently rebuilt in stone. The <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> augmented by various ditches, berms, and forts.|$|E
5|$|A {{new city}} <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> built around Cairo on {{the orders of}} the vizier Badr al-Jamali (r. 1074–1094).|$|E
5|$|A new weir <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} between 1992 and 2000 due {{to safety}} concerns {{with the original}} wall. Construction was planned to limit negative affects on scenery and wildlife. To this end, natural stones {{were used for the}} exterior and fishways were included in the design.|$|E
50|$|The area {{within the}} now ruined ramparts is 1560 m2. Most of the {{buildings}} are ruined. The only partially standing building is a three-story donjon. The length of the eastern <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 9.60 m and its height is 12 m. The northern <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 11.5 m long and 13 m high. The width of the outer <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 1.50 m. The masonry of the inner <b>walls</b> <b>is</b> of ashlar blocks and the outer <b>walls</b> <b>is</b> of bossage blocks.|$|R
50|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{through the}} <b>wall</b> can <b>be</b> specified {{or if the}} <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> considered adiabatic, then heat transfer across the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> set to zero.|$|R
50|$|A {{partition}} <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> a <b>wall</b> {{that separates}} rooms, or divides a room. Partition <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> usually not load-bearing. Partition <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> constructed of many materials, including steel panels, bricks, blocks of clay, terra-cotta, concrete, or glass blocks.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{defensive}} <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> never fully completed, many bunkers still exist near Ostend, Channel Islands, Scheveningen, Den Haag, Katwijk, and in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{was seriously}} {{affected}} by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, and various flood defences have been installed since then. In 1911, a concrete sea <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> built, and after World War II further additions to the defences were made using {{the remains of a}} Mulberry harbour.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{immediately}} {{south of}} the south range uncovered part of a substructure consisting of a well-preserved stucco-covered talud wall and a stairway, these {{are thought to be}} the remains of a terrace platform. A portion of a second terrace talud <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> also uncovered.|$|E
50|$|The <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> single-skin with exposed studs to {{the east}} and west verandahs. The west <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> lined with 140mm {{horizontal}} beaded tongue and groove boards. The south <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> clad to the exterior with rough sawn beaded tongue and groove boards with joins at the junctions of the stud framing and the internal partitions. The north <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> clad with horizontal beaded tongue and groove boards.|$|R
50|$|The south <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 923 {{feet long}} and the east <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 817 feet long, {{ignoring}} breaks for entrances.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{magnetic}} field on fluid flow and heat transfer in two-dimensional square cavity is analyzed numerically. The vertical <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> insulated; the top <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> maintained at cold temperature, Tc while the bottom <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> maintained at hot temperature, Th where Th>Tc. The dimensionless governing equations are solved using finite volume method and SIMPLE algorithm. The streamlines and isotherm plots and the variation of Nusselt numbers on {{hot and cold}} <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> presented...|$|R
5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out {{beginning}} in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. The roof was rebuilt, the south <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt using the original materials, and the main features of the 12th-century chancel arch were discarded.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it is {{unwise to}} dismiss it {{altogether}} {{as it is}} also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as Praetorian Prefect in 193. Likewise, the information that Hadrian's <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> constructed during Hadrian's reign and that the Antonine <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> built during the reign of Antoninus Pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the Historia Augusta, the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Several fatal {{incidents}} {{combined with}} general passenger concern caused the canal company to improve passenger safety; in 1802 a <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{built at the}} wharf at Oldfield Lane in Salford and in 1833 a gas lamp was installed at Ringley Wharf.|$|E
50|$|If {{the barbarians}} pillage your city, then the city <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> also {{destroyed}} and the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> {{removed from the}} board.|$|R
5000|$|A {{second type}} of archaeal cell <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> found in Methanosarcina and Halococcus. This type of cell <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} entirely of {{a thick layer of}} polysaccharides, which may be sulfated in the case of Halococcus. [...] Structure in this type of <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> complex and not fully investigated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> {{constructed}} of squared rubble, approximately 45 cm thick, rendered and scribed externally to imitate ashlar. A stone chimney {{remains at the}} northern end. The front (eastern) <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> of unrendered stone with irregular pointing. The window, doors and corners of this <b>wall</b> <b>are</b> rendered to resemble stone quoins.|$|R
5|$|Several months later, the {{pavement}} {{close to the}} <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> excavated {{to a depth of}} two and half metres, exposing an additional two courses of large stones.|$|E
5|$|The double album The <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> written {{almost entirely}} by Waters and is largely based on his life story, and having sold over 23million RIAA {{certified}} units in the US as of 2013, {{is one of the}} top three best-selling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA. Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album, and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the album's sleeve art. The band embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of The <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.|$|E
5|$|The project {{lowered the}} height of the castle considerably, {{destroying}} much of the fortification in the process. The upper storeys of the keep, the towers, the covered passageways and the gatehouse were all demolished, along with some of the buildings in the inner ward. The resulting rubble was used to backfill the outer ward, raising its height and effectively turning the inner ward into a dry moat. The inner curtain <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> reduced to one storey in height, and the outer curtain <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> refaced. An esplanade and wall-walk were built around the remaining outer walls, which supported at least eight gun emplacements.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> built {{during the}} 12th century. In the 17th century the <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt and {{reinforced}} by bastions, ravelins and artillery batteries.|$|R
50|$|When a box {{is slowly}} expanded, the {{frequency}} of the light recoiling from thewall can be computed from the Doppler shift. If the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> not moving,the light recoils at the same frequency. If the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> moving slowly, the recoil frequency is only equal in the frame where the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> stationary. In the frame where the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> moving away from the light, the light coming in is bluer than the light coming out by twice the Doppler shift factor v/c.|$|R

5|$|The {{second phase}} of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, each of which were over {{twice the size of}} the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders in the second phase also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> elevated and the southwestern curtain <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E
5|$|The town <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> kept in good repair whilst {{there was}} a threat of {{invasion}} from the Scots. In 1342, David II of Scotland invaded Northumberland and laid siege to Newcastle, without success. In 1388, another Scottish army under the Earl of Douglas assaulted the town, but was repulsed. As the border wars between England and Scotland became less frequent, and in particular following the union of the two crowns in 1603, the <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> allowed to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several town walls around Edinburgh, Scotland, since the 12th century. Some form of wall {{probably}} existed from {{the foundation of the}} royal burgh in around 1125, though the first building is recorded in the mid-15th century, when the King's <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> constructed. In the 16th century the more extensive Flodden <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> erected, following the Scots' defeat at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. This was extended by the Telfer Wall in the early 17th century. The walls had a number of gates, known as ports, the most important being the Netherbow Port, which stood halfway down the Royal Mile. This gave access from the Canongate which was, at that time, a separate burgh.|$|E
50|$|The <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> {{horizontally}} divided: the <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> {{perpendicular to}} {{a height of}} approximately 2.3 meters, then, on a small ledge the walls slope slightly inwards. On a higher cornice rectangular strip, almost covering the entire upper third of the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> a recess with a niche frieze depicting a “sky full of stars".|$|R
5000|$|Tzaraath only affects {{houses that}} are built {{entirely out of}} stones, wood and clay plaster. If {{any of the four}} <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> built or {{internally}} overlaid with marble, natural outcropping of rock, brick or earthen soil, that <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> insusceptible to tzaraath, and a house cannot be rendered impure unless all four <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> susceptible.|$|R
40|$|A {{theory for}} the spin wave {{eigenmodes}} of a Dzyaloshinskii domain <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> presented. These <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> Néel-type domain <b>walls</b> that can appear in perpendicularly-magnetized ultrathin ferromagnets {{in the presence}} of a sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The mode frequencies for spin waves propagating parallel and perpendicular to the domain <b>wall</b> <b>are</b> computed using a continuum approximation. In contrast to Bloch-type <b>walls,</b> it <b>is</b> found that the spin wave potential associated with Dzyaloshinskii domain <b>walls</b> <b>is</b> not reflectionless, which leads to a finite scattering cross-section for interactions between spin waves and domain walls. A gap produced by the Dzyaloshinskii interaction emerges, and consequences for spin wave driven domain wall motion and band structures arising from periodic <b>wall</b> arrays <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R

5|$|A second {{documentary}} titled Behind the <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> first {{broadcast on}} 12 November 2010, {{and looks at}} the case of another similar detainee, while probing more closely at a four-month period in Ashley Smith's detention while at the Regional Psychiatric Centre, Prairies, Saskatoon. The program also depicts the two-year conflict between The Fifth Estate and CSC to broadcast more footage of the last days of Ashley Smith.|$|E
5|$|A <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{built around}} the monastery in 1803 and, {{fourteen}} years later, the Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross) was completely renovated and converted into a depository of manuscripts by archbishop Galust. In 1832, Tamur pasha of Van robbed the monastery's treasures and strangled the father Mktrich vardapet Gaghatatsi to death. In 1849, Gabriel vardapet Shiroyan restored the Church of Sion, which had been destroyed by an earthquake, and converted it into a wheat warehouse.|$|E
50|$|The central tumulus {{is built}} from smaller rocks, and {{is thought to}} have been {{constructed}} after the surrounding <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> constructed. Connecting to it are four main stone walls. The first wall, shaped like a semicircle, is 50m in diameter and 1.5m wide. That <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> connected to a second one, an almost complete circle 90m in diameter. The third <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> a full circle, 110m in diameter and 2.6m wide.
