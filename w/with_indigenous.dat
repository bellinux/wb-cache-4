5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations <b>with</b> <b>Indigenous</b> peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E

5|$|Cannibal Holocaust is a 1980 Italian cannibal horror film {{directed}} by Ruggero Deodato from a screenplay by Gianfranco Clerici. It stars Carl Gabriel Yorke, Robert Kerman, Francesca Ciardi, Perry Pirkanen, and Luca Barbareschi. Influenced by {{the works of}} Mondo director Gualtiero Jacopetti, the film was inspired by Italian media reporting of Red Brigade terrorism. The coverage included news reports Deodato believed to be staged, an idea which became an integral aspect of the film's story. Cannibal Holocaust was filmed primarily in the Amazon rainforest of Colombia <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> tribes interacting with American and Italian actors.|$|E
5|$|Christianity is the {{official}} religion in Zambia according to the Constitution of Zambia. Christians belonging to various denominations formed a majority, while many other religious traditions were also present in the country. In 2010, according to World Christian Trends, 85.5 per cent of the population were identified as Christian, 11.2 per cent <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> religions, 1.8 per cent as Bahá'í, 1.1 per cent as Muslim, 0.2 per cent as agnostic, 0.1 per cent as Hindu, and all other groups accounted for less than 0.1 per cent. The 2010 Zambian census found that 75.3 per cent of Zambians were Protestant, 20.2 per cent were Catholic, 0.5 per cent were Muslim, 2.0 per cent followed other religions, and 1.8 per cent had no religion.|$|E
5|$|Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes {{was brought}} about by a {{combination}} of Han imperial military power, regular Han Chinese settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees. The military invasions and an influx Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> elements. Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors, stoves, wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured {{in the style of the}} Han.|$|E

A travelogue of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|The mallard is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Unlike many waterfowl, mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The non-migratory mallard interbreeds <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted by the domesticated and feral mallard populations.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs <b>with</b> <b>Indigenous</b> communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> groups, who often {{practice}} traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many waterfowl, mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much {{so that they are}} now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E

5|$|Having {{secured the}} Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula of Matabeleland on 30 October 1888, Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889. Under this charter, the Company was {{empowered}} to trade <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise {{and run a}} police force. In return for these rights, the British South Africa Company would administer and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders. Though the Company made good on most of these pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Lobengula reacted by making war on the new arrivals, their Tswana allies and the local Mashona people in 1893. The resulting conflict ended with Lobengula's torching of his own capital at Bulawayo, his death from smallpox in early 1894, and the subsequent submission of his izinDuna (advisors) to the Company. Violent rebellion to the north-east, in neighbouring Mashonaland, was forcibly put down by the Company during 1897.|$|E
5|$|The Russian system {{differed}} from the British and American systems in its relationship <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> peoples. Using the same method they had used in Siberia, the Russians employed or enserfed Aleut and Alutiiq people, the latter being a subgroup of the Yupik Eskimo people. The Aleut and Alutiiq people were expert sea otter hunters, noted for their use of kayaks and baidarkas. Russian ships were mainly used for transporting and assisting native hunting parties. This {{differed from}} the British and American system, where the natives hunted sea otters and prepared the furs on their own, and were essentially independent agents of the fur trade. The Russians did not trade freely with the native Alaskans; rather, they imposed a fur tribute known as yasak. The yasak system, which was widely used in Siberia, essentially enslaved the natives. In 1788, it was banned in Russian America, only {{to be replaced by}} compulsory labor.|$|E
5|$|The local {{population}} in Soviet occupied eastern Poland prior to German Operation Barbarossa of 1941, had witnessed the repressions and mass deportation {{of up to}} 1.5 million ethnic Poles to Siberia, conducted by the NKVD, The Anti-Semitic attitudes had been exploited by the Nazi Einsatzgruppen who induced anti-Jewish pogroms {{on the order of}} Reinhard Heydrich. A total of 31 deadly pogroms were carried out throughout the region in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> auxiliary police. The Ukrainian People's Militia spread terror across dozens of cities with the blessings of the SS, including Lwów (Lemberg), Tarnopol, Stanisławów, Łuck, Drohobycz, as well as Dubno, Kołomyja, Kostopol, Sarny, Złoczów and numerous other towns. Further north-west, during the massacre in Jedwabne, a group of ethnic Poles in the presence of German gendarmerie and the SS men of Einsatzgruppe B under Schaper set fire to a barn with over 300 Jews burned to death.|$|E

5|$|The {{river is}} known for its once {{prolific}} runs of anadromous fish, notably Chinook salmon and steelhead, which sustained Native American tribes for thousands of years. Due to its remoteness, the Trinity did not feature prominently in the early European colonization of California, but the gold rush in the mid-1800s brought thousands of gold seekers to the area. The river was named by Major Pierson B. Reading who, upon reaching the river in 1848, mistakenly believed it to flow into the Pacific Ocean at Trinidad Bay. During and after the gold rush, the influx of settlers and miners into the Trinity River country led to conflict <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> tribes, many of which saw severe depopulation due to fighting and foreign diseases. In the following decades logging and ranching, combined with mining runoff, significantly changed the river's ecology and led to the decline of its fish populations.|$|E
5|$|To {{facilitate}} the colonial expeditions, the Brandenburg African Company {{was founded on}} 7 March 1682, initially with its headquarters in Berlin and its shipyards in Pillau, since 1683 in Emden. Throughout its existence, the company was underfunded, and expeditions were financed also by private capital, including payments by Raule and Frederick William. In July 1682, an expedition under East Prussian Otto Friedrich von der Groeben was sent to Guinea to erect the fortress Großfriedrichsburg. On 24 February 1684, another treaty <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> chiefs was signed that allowed the erection of a second fort in nearby Accada (now Akwida), named Dorotheenschanze after Frederick William's second wife. On 4 February 1685, a treaty was signed with the chiefs of Taccararay (now Takoradi), some 30 kilometers east of Großfriedrichsburg. A fourth fort was built at a spring {{near the village of}} Taccrama, between Großfriedrichsburg and Dorotheenschanze, named Loge or Sophie-Louise-Schanze. Overall, the colony comprised roughly 50 kilometers of coastline, and did not extend into the hinterland.|$|E
5|$|The churches {{had three}} aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting {{resembling}} those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, {{there were no}} pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn {{the inside of the}} churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together <b>with</b> <b>indigenous</b> peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands. The tradition of figure carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, finials and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area. In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.|$|E
