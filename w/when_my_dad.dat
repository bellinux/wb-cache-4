500|$|Villa {{was born}} in Tuilla, a small parish in Langreo, Asturias, a region in {{northern}} Spain, the son of José Manuel Villa, a miner. When Villa was four, his chances of becoming a footballer were put in jeopardy when he suffered a fracture to the femur in his right leg, but he made a complete recovery. Due to the injury, {{he and his father}} worked on strengthening his left leg and Villa ultimately became ambidextrous. He recalls his father being consistently supportive: [...] "He would be there throwing me the ball over and over, making me kick it with my left leg when my right was in plaster after breaking it, I was four. I can barely remember a single training session <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> wasn't there. I have never been alone on a football pitch." ...|$|E

[...] "Gig" [...] is Morton's given name and, {{when asked about}} where the name {{originated}} during an interview with Celebuzz, Morton explained - [...] "It’s actually my real name that’s on my birth certificate. It’s a funny story: <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> was little — my dad’s name is Gary — his little brother couldn’t say Gary, so he called him ‘Gig’ and that became his nickname.

But in the end, it came down to 'forgiveness' in the end <b>when</b> I forgave <b>my</b> <b>Dad</b> there was a real healing that came in my life and the song The Older I Get was about that and saying I wish I could go back... {{do it all over again}} and I would probably make that step earlier towards forgiving him because my life got so much better when I did." ...|$|R

In a 2012 interview, Adams recalled: <b>When</b> I lost <b>my</b> <b>dad,</b> that was a big hit for me. I didn't have that parental guidance, and I kind of took advantage of it because I was a stupid idiot. I decided not to go to school a couple of times, go when I felt like it. I always lied to my brothers and sisters. They'd ask: 'Are you going to school?' I'd say 'yeah'. They eventually found out.|$|R
50|$|The {{adoption}} {{of rock and}} roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes. As Billy Burnette said about his father Dorsey Burnette and uncle Johnny Burnette:They'd buy their clothes on Beale Street, at Lansky Brothers, where all the black people shopped. Right outside Memphis, there was a voodoo village, all black-real mystic kind of people... A lot of real old line southern people called my dad and my uncle white nigger.

5000|$|I {{never had}} much of a family experience. Most of my {{relatives}} have passed away, and I have no contact with the other ones I know of. My father didn’t help us out when I was growing up. We were so poor. And his family had money. Plenty of money. But he was the wandering addict fuck-up, so they distanced themselves from my family. My grandmother once told my mother, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> had disappeared and we were starving, “You guys aren’t my problem anymore.” And my sister and I were told that we had grown up to be huge disappointments to them ...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} braids {{together two}} narratives. One is about my immediate family: {{my father had}} three boys—my older brothers—with his first wife, who died, {{after two years of}} illness, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> brothers were young. I am his only child with my mother, who was twenty-six <b>when</b> she married <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and took on the role of parenting the boys. The second narrative traces my fixation, as a young, single woman, on romantic love: I write a blog about relationships, and have long been consumed by a search for connection shaped by the isolation I’ve felt within my family. The arc of the second narrative ties into the first as the narrator, after years of feeling afraid to write about the family and focusing on relationships instead, finally begins to tell the family's story—to her surprise, engaging them in that process.

25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old <b>when</b> I heard <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|R

5000|$|In 1999, {{he began}} writing Rap songs and started {{performing}} them at social events held at his school. It {{was not until}} 2001 that he began going to studios to record. In 2002, he got together {{with a couple of}} friends and formed a group called the [...] "Ecomog Squad". They had few performances as a group and split a year later. In 2004, he connected with M.I, Jesse Jagz, Ruby, Lindsey, Eve, Taz, and together they became what is now known today as the [...] "Loopy Crew". During an interview with Adeola Adeyemo, Ice Prince was asked to summarise his story. He said [...] "I started out in Jos in a group called ECOMOG squad. We used to rap and sing together. The group split up after a few years and after that, I joined the choir in my church and started singing Tenor. That was about the time MI moved back to Nigeria and we became friends, we became family, we started living together, started making music together. I had a song that made it to Number 1 in Jos, that was when I started getting more attention. Then I got admitted into University of Jos to study Zoology but then I couldn't really continue because of some financial constraint at the time." [...] Ice Prince also opened up about the passing of his parents and the challenges he faced early on. He said: [...] "Life was not that rosy. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> was alive, life was pretty much rosy but I lost my Dad in 1999 and it was my Mum that was taking care of me up until she died too. So it was kinda hard to get by, really. I dropped out of school in my 100Level to focus on my music.I moved to Abuja and started living with MI and Jesse Jagz. We were making music, doing some small small shows just to get money. Then we moved to Lagos, we got a chance to chill at Djinee’s house. Djinee gave us some space in his house to sleep. Djinee is like my Jesus. He came through for us. We lived in his house and made it very uncomfortable for him but he took all the pain and accommodated us. This was in 2008. Gradually, there was steady growth. We got our own place, started making music. In 2008, I hosted Sprite Triple Slam. We did 30 shows, 15 in Lagos, 15 in the East. I got some small money off that to buy some new jeans and shoes so that girls would, you know, say hi to me when they see me." ...|$|E
40|$|When I was {{six years}} old my dad told me he grew up in a {{religious}} cult called Wisdom Knowledge Faith Love Fountain of the World, where a man he called “the master” said he was the second coming of Christ- turns out he wasn’t. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> was twelve, two disgruntled members, blew up the building my grandparents and uncle were sleeping in and they died. I had a lot of questions, but my dad didn’t have many answers because he blocked much of the experience out – as many survivors of trauma do. This half-hour film documents my quest for the truth of my dad’s mysterious childhood. Why did my grandparents join a cult? How did my dad and uncle cope growing up barefoot with long braids in LA public schools during an era of crew cuts? How did they cope with the loss of their parents and assimilation back into mainstream culture? In order to tell the story I travel with my dad and uncle to the places of their childhood, all the time trying to get my dad to answer questions he couldn’t in the past. This story of a daughter probing into family history touches on the early days of a counter culture movement and the effects on one family involved. Even though I set out to understand my grandparents in the end I learned more about my dad and uncle’s survival as our relationship deepened through the filmmaking process...|$|E
40|$|First I {{would like}} to thank my family: my wife, Thuy, for her forever love, {{companionship}} and years long support and encouragement throughout the best and hardest times; my two sons Khoa (7 yrd) and Khiem (4 yrd) for their being good boys and understanding that dad is busy on his research and not having enough time to play with them.
