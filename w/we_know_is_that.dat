25|$|Juego del Palo is a Canarian martial art which {{literally}} {{translates as}} {{game of the}} stick. It is played by two players both armed with sticks. They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it is based on}} a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is." [...] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: [...] "Well, honey, one thing <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she's been poaching on my literary preserves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they went}} under {{the names of}} Leeds and Cross,” {{answered}} Dave. “But those are not their right names.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could make}} no {{satisfactory}} reply to this question, and plainly told him so. We {{had nothing to}} guide us on the search. The old man had given us no idea of where he might go, and all <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he disappeared beyond the burning tavern.|$|R
5000|$|With {{some fans}} {{reportedly}} detecting [...] "something romantic" [...] between the characters early on, Evans {{stated that he}} and Claywell were initially unsure of their characters' mutual history, saying, [...] "All <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> something had happened, but we weren't necessarily sure what it was. We had our different ideas. It's funny to see people say, 'I knew it! I knew it!.'" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{all came}} like a thunderclap on Gil's friends here at Greendale, because we hadn't ever {{suspected}} {{things were going}} wrong. The first thing <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Anne had gone up west to teach school again at St. Mary's, eighty miles away, and Gilbert, {{he went out to}} Manitoba on a harvest excursion and stayed there. It just about broke his parents' hearts. He was their only child and they just worshipped him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Virginia, quickly. [...] "All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Lyon {{has left}} Springfield {{to meet our}} troops, and that a great battle is coming, Perhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} glad, sir, {{if you will}} tell us what has been {{happening}} here. All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the fort of Coomassie is surrounded, {{and that we have}} come up to relieve it." ...|$|E
60|$|So all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> William {{fell upon}} Morcar's men at Stafford, and smote {{them with a}} great destruction; rolling the fugitives west and east, toward Edwin, perhaps, at Chester, {{certainly}} toward Hereward in the fens.|$|E
6000|$|... "The king will {{be pleased}} when I return with you, for we all feared <b>that</b> you might <b>be</b> very badly hurt. All <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some of your men had seen you cut down. After the battle was over, a search was made for your body. When {{it could not be}} found, {{questions}} were asked of some of our own men, and some wounded Russians, who were lying near the spot where you had been seen to fall.|$|R
5000|$|Designer Randy Breen recounted, [...] "Initially all <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wanted Road Rash {{to be more}} of an {{entertaining}} game than a pure driving simulation. I'd been into motorcycles for a long time, and we quickly realized bikes gave us lots of technical advantages. For instance, we could put more bikes than cars onscreen at once, and the bikers were more visible than car drivers, so they could be more expressive." [...] The fighting element of the game was inspired by the behavior of Grand Prix motorcyclists, who Breen noticed would sometimes shove and kick each other during races.|$|R
60|$|About a {{week later}} {{the rest of us}} started from Marais's camp, a place that, {{notwithstanding}} the sadness of many of its associations, I confess I left with some regret. The trek before us, although not so very long, was of an extremely perilous nature. We had to pass through about two hundred miles of country of which all <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> its inhabitants <b>were</b> the Amatonga and other savage tribes. Here I should explain that after much discussion we had abandoned the idea of retracing the route followed by Marais on his ill-fated journey towards Delagoa.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But no searching {{finds out}} all about God!' said Felix reverently. 'All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> He is so {{infinitely}} great and wise, {{that of course}} we cannot understand why all He does is right, {{any more than a}} private soldier understands his general's orders.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “If {{you could}} manage to {{remember}} where you did leave her, {{it would be more}} to the point than these negative assurances,” said Lady Beanford; “so far, all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she is not at the Carrywoods’, or Ada Spelvexit’s, or Westminster Abbey.” ...|$|E
60|$|We cannot {{state with}} {{certainty}} {{what were the}} motives which induced Pungarin to spare the lives of Mr Hazlit and his family; all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> he transferred them to his junk. After taking everything of value out of the schooner, he scuttled her.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she went}} to a low place in the wall and stood there as though she were {{considering}} the scene beyond. It seemed to us, indeed, that she saw what she had not expected and was thereby perplexed or angered. Presently she appeared to make up her mind, for again she motioned to us to remain where we were, enjoining silence upon us by placing her swathed hand upon the mask that hid her face. Next moment she was gone. How she went, or whither, I cannot say; all <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> no longer there.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were all}} in the procession, dressed up in all sorts of ragged finery, until the last moment," [...] {{explained}} Lord Tony to Marguerite as the entire party now quickly made its way to the harbour. [...] "We did not <b>know</b> what <b>was</b> going to happen.... All <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> wanted about this time--the hour when the duel was to have been fought--and somewhere near here on the southern ramparts... and we always have strict orders to mix with the crowd if there happens to be one. When we saw Blakeney raise the candlesticks we guessed what was coming, and we each went to our respective posts. It was all quite simple." ...|$|R
50|$|Nate {{is another}} Ely brother. All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about him <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he rides a horse named Digger.|$|R
60|$|But {{day after}} day dragged by and no ransom was offered! It seems incredible, but it is true. Was that reptile Tremouille busy at the King's ear? All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the King was silent, and made no offer and no effort in behalf of this poor girl who had done so much for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps not," [...] {{admitted}} the dressmaker. [...] "Joselyn {{is gone and}} no one'll ever get the truth out of Cragg. But--I'd like to know, myself, not only how the story ends but {{what it was all}} about. Just now all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there was a story, of some sort or other, and perhaps is yet." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{admits that}} she had a {{conversation}} with Mrs. Eustace Macallan, in which that lady questioned her on the subject of cosmetic applications to the complexion. Did nothing else take place at that interview? Did Mrs. Beauly make no discoveries (afterward turned to fatal account) of the dangerous experiment which her hostess was then trying to improve her ugly complexion? All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Beauly said nothing about it.|$|E
40|$|What <b>we</b> now <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the most}} {{effective}} local communities are those where neighborhoods and citizens have reclaimed their traditional roles.

6000|$|Without {{pausing to}} make any closer {{examination}} of these crumbled carvings, we entered the yawning mouth of that great place, following and indeed walking in the deep grooves that I have mentioned. Presently it seemed to open out as a courtyard might {{at the end of}} a passage; yes, to open on to some vast place whereof in that gloom we could not see the roof or the limits. All <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it must <b>be</b> enormous--the echoes of our voices and footsteps told us as much, for these seemed to come back to us from high, high above and from far, far away. Bickley and I said nothing; we were too overcome. But Bastin remarked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{we see a}} monk {{going about}} with a lion and looking up into heaven, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> St. Mark. When we see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, {{trying to think of}} a word, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> St. Matthew. When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other baggage, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> St. Jerome. Because <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage. When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are. We do this because we humbly wish to learn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{wonderful}} girl, Neale. We're all in {{love with}} her," [...] declared the chief. [...] "She dropped down on us one night--asked for protection and you. She does not talk much. All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she is the girl you saved back in the hills and has been kept a prisoner. Here she hides, by day and night. She will not talk. But we know she fears some one." ...|$|E
60|$|What eloquence he {{had used}} with his father, to {{convince}} him of the innocence, the honour, and the high descent of the alchymist, and of the exalted worth of his daughter, does not appear. All that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the father, though a very passionate, was a very reasonable man, as appears by his consenting that his son should return to Granada, and conduct Inez as his affianced bride to Valentia.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Founder was {{an obscure}} person {{from a small}} town in the American Middle West. We don't even know his name. All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one day he appeared, preaching a {{doctrine}} of non-violence, non-resistance; no fighting, no paying taxes for guns, no research except for medicine. Live out your life quietly, tending your garden, staying out of public affairs; mind your own business. Be obscure, unknown, poor. Give away most of your possessions, leave the city. At least that was what developed from what he told the people." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{we started}} from Esquimain River. The best joke, however, of all <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> neither I nor my man had ever {{travelled}} that way before! All <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had to walk}} fifty miles through an uninhabited country, and that then we should, or at least ought to, reach Isle Jeremie. There were two solitary houses, however, {{that we had to}} pass on the way; the one an outpost of the Hudson Bay Company, the other a saw-mill belonging to one of the lumber companies (or timber-traders) in Quebec. In fact, the best idea of our situation may be had from the following lines, which may be supposed to have been uttered by the establishment to which we were bound:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are merely}} a few {{references}} {{to the life of}} Theagenes of Megara (Θεαγένης ὁ Μεγαρεύς) amongst the ancient authors, which makes outlining a vague biography almost impossible. What <b>we</b> do <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Theagenes of Megara was among the first of Greek tyrants, possibly inspired by Cypselus of neighbouring Corinth.|$|R
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{the climate}} <b>is</b> changing, and <b>that</b> the trend <b>is</b> towards a warmer, wetter Fennoscandian Arctic. <b>We</b> also <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> some {{uncertainties}} about how climate change will impact {{different aspects of}} our physical, socio-economicand spiritual environments. What <b>we</b> do <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need to plan for change,and for uncertainty. Mistra Arcti...|$|R
60|$|The room is so dark that {{we cannot}} see her. All <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{she is one}} of four shapes {{gathered}} round a small table. Beyond the darkness is a great ingle-nook, in which is seated on a settle a man of fifty. Him we can discern fitfully {{by the light of the}} fire. It is not sufficiently bright to enable him to read, but an evening paper lies on his knee. He seems wistful and meek. He is paying no attention to the party round the table. When he hears their voices it is only as empty sounds.|$|E
60|$|Moreover, had Cardinal Roderigo {{desired to}} fasten the {{paternity}} of Cesare on another, there {{was ready to}} his hand Vannozza's actual husband, Giorgio della Croce.(2) When exactly this man became her husband {{is not to be}} ascertained. All that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was so in 1480, and that she was living with him in that year in a house in Piazza Pizzo di Merlo (now Piazza Sforza Cesarini) not far from the house on Banchi Vecchi which Cardinal Roderigo, as Vice-Chancellor, had converted into a palace for himself, and a palace so sumptuous as to excite the wonder of that magnificent age.|$|E
60|$|How {{these two}} {{came to be}} together, and to be there, {{it is not our}} {{business}} to say. Authors are fortunately not bound to account for everything they relate. All that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> Mr Queeker was there in the furtherance, probably, of his secret mission, and that Mr Larks' missions appeared to be always more or less secret. At all events, there they were together; fellow-students, apparently, of the geology or conchology of that region, if one might judge from the earnest manner in which they stooped and gazed at the sands, and picked up bits of flint or small shells, over which they held frequent, and, no doubt, learned discussions of an intensely engrossing nature.|$|E
