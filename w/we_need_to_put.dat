Learners’ behaviours are changing because of the unprecedented growth in the use of computer-based technologies in everyday life; education must follow. In this paper I would like <b>to</b> argue that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> look beyond that surface understanding. Twentieth century debates on the about the future of computer assisted learning were accompanied by the health warning that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> pedagogy before technology. Today <b>we</b> still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> think about what we learn, how we learn and how we are motivated to learn. We should beware of becoming obsessed with the leisure habits of young people. We should instead look to see how those leisure habits can act as vehicles to develop skills, knowledge and understanding necessary for a success. In today’s world information is our most valuable commodity whose half-life is rapidly decreasing. We have the opportunity to develop self-sustaining educational approaches which prepare learners for a future where they may take on roles and careers which are not yet imagined or created...|$|R

They form an associative algebra A, {{which is also}} the commutant of the holonomy group of g. As any associative algebra, A is the sum of its radical and of a semi-simple algebra S. Here we study S: it may be of eight different types, including the generic type S=R. Id, and the Kähler and hyperkähler types 'S isomorphic to C' and 'S isomorphic to the quaternions'. This is a result on real, semi-simple algebras with involution. For each type, the corresponding set of germs of metrics is non-empty; we parametrise it.

40|$|Abstract—Applying network coding on {{broadcasting}} service {{is known to}} reduce times of transmission {{in the process of}} recovering the loss packets. In previous design, coding coefficients are put in the packet headers so that MSs can decode the coded packets. However, it causes extra overhead. Moreover, since many mechanisms depend on feedback information to encode packets, they may cease operating once they are out of feedback support. To address these problems, we propose a codebook-based network coding scheme, Pseudo Random Network Coding (PRNC). The codebook defines the coding coefficients of the transmission packets; therefore, <b>we</b> only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the index of the codebook in the packet header to decode packets. The simulation result shows that PRNC decodes more packets and has higher all-perfect decoding ratio compared with other network coding schemes...|$|R
5000|$|Expanding on {{this notion}} {{a year later}} in Migrations of the Real and the Ideal: Exploring a Nomadic Criticism, (published in the premiere issue of Trans>Arts, Culture, Media), Denson writes: [...] "Because {{there are so many}} models of reality and {{identity}} existing simultaneously, {{because there are so many}} societies and cultures converging in a global community, because discourse is being negotiated among them, and because we are recognizing multiple histories of the world, we require a critical attitude that rides with the shifts in civilization's discourse. The best of today's critics are ready to visit the models of any given community—ideological, spiritual, political, economic, technological, scientific, aesthetic—at any given time without obstructing communication and insinuating personal models on them. This does not mean that we must have expertise in those models or even accept them personally, but we must be ready to defer and then adapt all personal criteria responsively in acknowledgement of the world's diversity. ...When two or more ideas conflict, the temptation often is to reconcile them. Nomadic criticism doesn’t require this. We needn’t reconcile an idea to any other, including the model of nomadism. We can just move among them, using them when <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to,</b> <b>putting</b> them on hold when we don’t. The nomadic ideal also doesn’t position two or more models in opposition. We think only of two or more ideas as being opposed if we think we hold a more comprehensive, singular, or foundational truth; nomadism holds that there are only shifting and contingent models that are as temporally relative as the condition among individuals, communities, and environments that produce them." ...|$|R

40|$|Not so long ago, we policymakers {{thought we}} knew just what {{challenges}} we were facing for Europe to better {{take advantage of}} globalisation through a more sustainable model: these were climate change and a rapidly ageing society.

What started in 2007 as a credit crisis in the US market for subprime mortgages turned into a full-blown global fi nancial crisis in 2008, following Lehman’s default and has taken us near to a sovereign debt crisis as countries face the fiscal consequences of financial instability, on top of large public indebtedness.

40|$|Software {{reliability}} growth {{model is}} one of the fundamental techniques to assess software reliability quantitatively. A number of testing-effort functions for modeling software reliability based on the non- homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) have been proposed in the past decades. Although these models are quite helpful for the software testing, <b>we</b> still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> more testing-effort into software reliability modeling. This paper develops a software reliability growth model based on the non-homogeneous Poisson process which incorporates the Burr Type III testing-effort. This scheme has a flexible structure and may cover many of the earlier results on software reliability growth modeling. Models parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation and the least square estimation methods, and software reliability measures are investigated through numerical experiments on actual data from three software projects. Results are compared with other existing models which reveal that the proposed software reliability growth model has a fairly better prediction capability and it depicts the real-life situation more faithfully. Also, these results can provide a flexible tool on the decision making for software engineers, software scientists, and software managers in the development company. Furthermore, the optimal software release policy for this model based on cost- reliability criteria has been discussed...|$|R
