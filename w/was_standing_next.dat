25|$|An {{eyewitness}} who {{was injured}} called Shaker Mohammed Abdulhussain told Al Wasat that police cars were parked near Salmaniya Medical Complex gates where the funeral {{was supposed to}} move out from. To prevent clashes between mourners and riot police, mourners formed a human chain in which Shaker <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to Al-Matrook. There were two people speaking to riot police telling them that the youth will ensure that nothing would go wrong. Then a man wearing full black came from outside the funeral and threw a stone at riot police, who then started firing rubber bullets and bird pellet gunshot indiscriminately. While Shaker and Al-Matrook were trying to help {{a man who was}} injured by rubber bullets to his leg, they were shot with bird pellet gunshot. Shaker was injured in his chest and other parts in the body, while Al-Matrook was injured in his back and died in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Casey joined the Australian Imperial Force as a lieutenant, {{was a member of the}} first convoy on board the Orvieto, was the responsible officer looking after the German prisoners from the SMS Emden following the Battle of Cocos until the ship reached Colombo, and served at Gallipoli as aide-de-camp to Major General Sir William Bridges. Casey <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to Bridges when Bridges was shot by a sniper (he died three days later). A statue of Casey being rescued by a Turkish soldier has pride of place in the Gallipoli battlefields. Later he served in France, where he observed operations and sifted information, earning the Military Cross and promotion to brigade major of the 8th Brigade. This position involved dangerous visits to the front line and he received a Distinguished Service Order in 1918. He resigned his commission in June 1919 and transferred to the Reserve of Officers, serving as a part-time intelligence officer in Melbourne.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Knopfler {{appeared}} on Parkinson on BBC One and explained again where the lyrics originated. According to Knopfler, {{he was in}} New York and stopped by an appliance store. At {{the back of the}} store, they had a wall of TVs which were all tuned to MTV. Knopfler said there was a man working there dressed in a baseball cap, work boots, and a checkered shirt delivering boxes who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to him watching. As they were standing there watching MTV, Knopfler remembers the man coming up with lines such as [...] "what are those, Hawaiian noises?...that ain't workin'," [...] etc. Knopfler asked for a pen to write some of these lines down and then eventually put those words to music.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958 {{one of his}} {{mechanical}} assemblages [...] "attacked" [...] a {{woman at}} the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's annual Christmas party and holiday exhibition. His [...] "Xmas Tree" [...] was [...] "sort of the pinnacle of the kinetic junk sculptures because I'd never attempted anything so complicated", built out of [...] "two radios, two phonographs, flashing lights, electric fans, saw motor--all controlled by timers, hooked so [...] would cycle all these things." [...] One of the record players played [...] "I Hate to See Christmas Come Around". At the opening, which Hedrick refused to attend, he set a timer so that the piece [...] "suddenly began flashing its lights, honking its horns, and playing its records." [...] One woman who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to the piece when it suddenly turned on found her fur coat tangled in it and then received an electrical shock.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{broadside}} sent splinters {{flying in}} the President's spar deck where Decatur was standing. A large splinter {{hit him in the}} chest knocked him over while another cut his forehead. His first Lieutenant who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to him had his leg cut off by a splinter and was knocked down and through the wardroom hatch. Another splinter fatally fractured the skull of a Lieutenant next to him too. Before that point it may well have been believed that Endymion was a standard 18-pounder frigate as she was firing at president with only her brass 18-pounder long bow chaser. It was clear that 24-pounder shot form Endymion's broadside was much more effective than the 18-pounder shot that Decatur had experienced from the HMS Macedonian while he was aboard the United States. Such 18-pounder shot from the HMS Guerriere was unable to pierce the USS Constitution which was built to the same design as President giving the Constitution the nickname of [...] "Old Ironsides" [...] It was clear that the British had learned from their losses early in the war.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E

60|$|A cheer {{broke from}} the {{passengers}} {{as they saw}} the movement of retreat. It was no longer necessary for any to reserve their fire, and this was redoubled. The natives were discouraged by the want of leaders; their principal chiefs had all been killed on the poop, and any other who attempted to rally them and lead them again to an attack was instantly shot down by Mr. Atherton, who, as Wilfrid, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to him observed, never once failed {{to bring down the}} man he aimed at.|$|E
60|$|As Mr. Trevor continued, {{his voice}} became firmer and his manner more majestic. It was a task {{distinctly}} to his taste, and {{one might have}} thought he was reading the sentence of a Hastings. I <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to his daughter. The look of astonishment, perhaps of horror, which I had seen on her face when her father first began to read had now faded into something akin to wickedness. Did she wink? I can't say, never before having had a young woman wink at me. But the next moment her vinaigrette was rolling down the bank towards the brook, and I was after it. I heard her close behind me. She must have read my intentions {{by a kind of}} mental telepathy.|$|E
60|$|All {{night the}} galley swept on before the storm. The {{light on the}} other boat had {{disappeared}} soon after darkness had set in. Half the soldiers and crew by turns were kept at work baling out the water which found its way over the sides, and several times so heavily did the seas break into her that all {{thought that she was}} lost. However, when morning broke she was still afloat. The wind had hardly shifted a point since it had begun to blow, and the pilot told Malchus that they must be very near to the coast of Sardinia. As the light brightened every eye was fixed ahead over the waste of angry foaming water. Presently the pilot, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to Malchus, grasped his arm.|$|E

6000|$|We {{were passing}} {{the corner of}} Bow-street, on our return from a {{lounging}} excursion the other afternoon, when a crowd, assembled round {{the door of the}} Police-office, attracted our attention. We turned up the street accordingly. There were thirty or forty people, standing on the pavement and half across the road; and a few stragglers were patiently stationed {{on the opposite side of}} the way—all evidently waiting in expectation of some arrival. We waited too, a few minutes, but nothing occurred; so, we turned round to an unshorn, sallow-looking cobbler, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> us with his hands under the bib of his apron, and put the usual question of ‘What’s the matter?’ The cobbler eyed us from head to foot, with superlative contempt, and laconically replied ‘Nuffin.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{it is our}} turn!" [...] {{the young}} officer cried. [...] "Follow me, my men; we will teach the dogs a lesson." [...] As he spoke he sprang from the bulwark down upon {{the deck of the}} corsair. Geoffrey, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> to him, {{followed}} his example, as did five or six soldiers. They were instantly engaged in a hand to hand fight with the Moors. In the din and confusion they heard not the shouts of their comrades. After a minute's fierce fighting, Geoffrey, finding that he and his companions were being pressed back, glanced round to see why support did not arrive, and saw that there were already thirty feet of water between the two vessels. He was about to spring overboard, when the Moors made a desperate rush, his guard was beaten down, a blow from a Moorish scimitar fell on his head, and he lost consciousness.|$|E

Besides, had you been {{detained}} for a month or six weeks, it is as likely as not that, what with the heat and what with the annoyance, your wound would have taken a bad turn. Now, you must let me exercise my authority and order you to your berth immediately. You ought not to have been out of it. Of the two evils, getting up and detention, I chose the least; but I should be glad now if you would go off at once.
