40|$|A well‐prepared index {{can greatly}} enhance a book’s {{usefulness}} to readers and researchers. An index should be {{considerably more than}} an outline or an expanded table of contents and considerably less than a concordance of words and phrases. A good index records every pertinent statement made within {{the body of the}} text. Making an index consists of assembling, analyzing, and arranging into entries all items pointing to the page numbers in the book where detailed information on all aspects of the subject may be found. For further information about the process of indexing, see The Chicago Manual of Style. If you {{do not have access to}} Chicago, we will be happy to lend you an offprint of the chapter on indexing. Please prepare your index on computer and send a copy on disk or by e‐mail. A note about software: The automated indexing feature that your word processor might contain will not create an index; it will create a concordance—a word list with page numbers that will not match the book’s <b>pagination</b> <b>without</b> extra work on your part. Indexing software, designed for professional indexers, costs several hundred dollars and takes a long time to learn. Professional indexers use such software t...|$|R
40|$|Author for {{correspondence}} In {{the course}} of investigating limestone plants in south-western Guangxi, China in 2011, we discovered an unusual Aspidistra Ker Gawler (1822 : <b>without</b> <b>pagination)</b> in Jinxi Xian, Guangxi, the leaf blade usually narrowly long to ribbon-shaped, its flower was dark purple, emitting unique flavor, the stamens were inserted {{on the bottom of}} perigone tube, closely attached to the pistil base. The plant was brought to the Guangxi Institute of Botany, Guilin. In the following year it flowered regularly, making possible a detailed description based on living plant material. Consultation of herbarium material and careful comparison with all Aspidistra species hitherto known fro...|$|E
40|$|During {{systematic}} {{studies on}} Polygonatum Miller (1754 : <b>without</b> <b>pagination),</b> {{the examination of}} type specimens and protologues revealed several nomenclature issues with regards to typification and priority of two species native to China. Polygonatum tsinlingense Tsui (1949 : 135), lacking type designation, was discovered to be an earlier name for P. gracile Li (1966 : 252). In addition P. franchetii Hua (1892 : 392), also lacking type designation, was described {{on the basis of}} a series of three different Farges collections from eastern Sichuan. For both species lectotypes are here selected. Herbarium acronyms follow Thiers (2015). Polygonatum tsinlingense The name Polygonatum tsinlingense has not been treated at species level or even as a synonym in any recent floristic works (Jeffrey 1980, Chen & Tamura 2000). Morphological comparisons of type specimens revealed that P. tsinlingense and P. gracile are heterotypic synonyms. Thus, the earlier validly published name, P. tsinlingense, has priority (Art. 11. 4 of ICN, McNeill et al. 2012). In the protologue of P. tsinlingense two gatherings were cited by Tsui (1949) without designation of a type. The first, T. N. Liou 10910, has not been located and was not cited by Li (1966), which suggests that it was probably already lost at that time. The second is still extant, W. Y. Hsia 4238 (PE 00223893, PE 01432739), and was also cited by Li (1966), which substantiates my own morphological comparisons that these two names are to be referred to the same species. Thus, the specimen PE 00223893 is here selected to serve as the lectotype (Arts. 9. ...|$|E
