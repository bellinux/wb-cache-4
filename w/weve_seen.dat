5000|$|On October 22, 2015, a {{black-and-white}} music video for [...] "Waitin for You" [...] directed by Black Coffee was released through Lovatos official Vevo channel on YouTube. As she is seen wearing no make {{up and a}} black bomber jacket with her album title printed in the back, the singer revisits her former middle school Cross Timbers Middle School in Grapevine, Texas, where she used to suffer from intense bullying experiences in the past, and struts around the schoolyard confidently while ready to fight. Sirah joins in later during her guest rap verse. Teen Vogues Hannah Weintraub called the video [...] "one of Demis most emotional performances <b>weve</b> ever <b>seen</b> and fitting for the personal song about her past". Writing for MTV, Madeline Roth remarked that the clip [...] "is refreshingly raw and understated" [...] {{in comparison to the}} [...] "big, glitzy productions" [...] of the first two music videos from the Confident era. She praised it as Lovatos [...] "most powerful" [...] video yet.|$|R
5000|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Jerrys {{presentation}} [...] "one of {{the most}} amazing scenes in Parks & Rec history". Heisler also praised Pratts performance and felt Ann was unusually sympathetic in [...] "Park Safety", but felt Samberg was poorly used and his loud talking quickly grew tiresome. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said [...] "Park Safety" [...] continued an ongoing development of the mythology of the Pawnee community, comparing it to [...] "a live-action Springfield", the setting of the animated comedy series The Simpsons. Kandell said Sambergs character [...] "could have been irritating but somehow wasnt". Matt Fowler of IGN called Jerrys presentation [...] "one of the best, most pointed moments of crude humor that <b>weve</b> ever <b>seen</b> on the show". Fowler also said Swansons expertise in self-defense [...] "fits perfectly" [...] to his character. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said the constant mocking of Jerry made him feel uncomfortable, and that Samberg [...] "just seemed like the personification of an SNL skit instead of a real character". But Gallagher praised Ron Swansons role in the episode, as well as the apparent rekindling of Anns feelings for Andy.|$|R

[...] A later CNET.com interview in April 2008 reported that [...] "For now, Miyamoto looks ahead to other projects for the Wii, mentioning his desire to continue the Pikmin series." ...|$|E
5000|$|Spaders acting {{had been}} {{particularly}} lauded by his fellow Office cast members. In {{an interview with}} Huffington Post, Brian Baumgartner stated that [...] "The energy Spader has is so totally different. The writers have done really a great job. He has these demented arguments that on the surface make no sense, but hes talking, and suddenly and youre like, Oh yeah, thats right! Thats right!". In the same interview, Kate Flannery commented that Spader [...] "has this grounded intensity that <b>weve</b> never <b>seen</b> on our show before that makes these kind of little Scranton peons stand at attention". In an interview with NBC Chicago.com, Angela Kinsey praised Spaders portrayal of California, stating “He is amazing. Our first table read with him was a week before we went back {{and at that moment}} I was like, Oh, were going to be just fine. He crushed the table read. He brings such a cool, amazing, intensity as Robert California thats so different from Michael Scott. Michael wanted everyone to love him. Robert California wants to run the best company in the world, and to see him turn that kind of intensity onto Kevin Malone was cracking me up. I just love him as this character. And its been really fun to watch Dwight and Robert California act". Paul Lieberstein was pleased that Spader would be joining the cast in the eighth season, stating that [...] "James has an energy that is completely his own, and The Office has no tools for dealing with this guy. Were thrilled hes joining our cast". On July 28, 2011, Rainn Wilson favorably tweeted, when referring to Spaders acting on the series, [...] "hes Killing it!!!!". Former leading actor Steve Carell was also impressed by the decision to hire Spader, stating in an interview with Access Hollywood, [...] "I think its an excellent choice. I think its great and he will infuse all this new energy into the show".|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reactions}} for ERs {{first season}} were very favorable. Alan Rich, writing for Variety, praised {{the direction and}} editing of the pilot while Eric Mink, writing for the New York Daily News, said that the pilot of ER [...] "was urban, emergency room chaos and young, committed doctors." [...] However some reviewers felt the episodes following the pilot didnt live up to it with Mink commenting that [...] "...the great promise of the [...] "E.R." [...] pilot dissolves {{into the kind of}} routine, predictable, sloppily detailed medical drama <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> many times before." ...|$|E
5000|$|On the {{subsequent}} success of L.A. Noire and Team Bondis relationship with Rockstar, Heironymus said:"L.A. Noire {{is the biggest}} game ever made in Australia... While we were making L.A. Noire <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> the game development community in Australia dwindle {{with the likes of}} Pandemic, Krome, Ratbag and Transmission closing their doors during our tenure. We could have gone the same way, and Im sure we came close to being cancelled several times. Having Rockstar as the publisher of L.A. Noire was a blessing, because their focus is on developing extremely high quality games. Rockstar kept faith with L.A. Noire and Team Bondi throughout the hard times because they could see the game L.A. Noire would eventually become." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics were {{generally}} unimpressed with Benefit upon its release. Rolling Stone reviewer called the album [...] "lame and dumb". Disc and Music Echo was also unimpressed but recognized the bands quality: [...] "This album doesnt advance {{by such a}} drastic leap as Stand Up did from This Was. Its more like the Jethro Tull <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> and heard for the past year. It {{seems to be a}} remarkably long album, and shows what an exciting group this is. Exciting because they can have quite long guitar breaks and still retain a very tight and together sound". The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau appreciated the riffs around which all the songs were constructed, but was taken away by the lyrics that he judged hard to recall.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reviews for}} this episode mainly {{concerned}} the seasons plot. Troy Rogers of UGO gave [...] "The Message" [...] a B+, stating, [...] "This week, Prison Break went the distance in connecting as many dots as possible, while catching {{us up to}} speed on a few long lost players, including Haywire, Sara, and Sucre." [...] Similarly, John Keegan of MediaBlvd muses that, [...] "Theres plenty of time left in the season to bring those to conclusion, but its also possible that they will remain open-ended. Only time will reveal these intentions." [...] A critic from Tv Fodder remarks that, [...] "Peeking ahead to the preview for next week, it should be more action packed than anything <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> in a while. Which will be a nice change of pace." ...|$|E
5000|$|GamePro {{gave the}} Jaguar version a {{positive}} review, {{saying that the}} varied abilities of the playable characters [...] "push this game {{to the top of}} the Jaguar hop-n-bop ranks." [...] GamePro also praised the graphics, stating that [...] "Zools Nth Dimension is a shiny, inventive world thats equal parts candy shop and toy store", and that the Jaguar version is sharper and brighter than previous versions of the game. Next Generation called it [...] "still a basic platform game, but one of the best <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> a while." [...] Like GamePro, they praised the quality of the graphics, and additionally the large number of interesting powerups and stages. Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly assessed it as [...] "a pretty good version of the pint-sized ninja character", particularly noting the large levels, though he felt the graphics were sometimes [...] "visual overkill." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rick Cole (born 1953) is {{the city}} manager of Santa Monica, California. Cole {{previously}} served as city manager of the City of Azusa, which was cited by {{an editorial in the}} San Gabriel Valley Tribune as the [...] "most improved City in the San Gabriel Valley" [...] during his tenure. He later served as city manager of Ventura, California from 2004 to 2012. On his resignation, the Ventura County Star editorialized: [...] "The Star hopes at least one thing wont change after Mr. Coles last day on the job: The high level of professionalism and integrity <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> in the city under his management and leadership." [...] The Star said Cole [...] "led a downtown revitalization, guided Ventura through daunting budget challenges and oversaw important but unsexy work such as improving public works, water and sewer operations." ...|$|E
5000|$|James Poniewozik of Time reacted {{positively}} to the episode, exclaiming that it [...] "paints a thoroughly convincing postapocalyptic world, both visually and emotionally." [...] Variety Brian Lowry avouched that [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] was [...] "surprisingly fresh", despite having initial thoughts of a stale premise. He wrote: [...] "The Walking Dead draws {{the audience in}} almost instantly with its cinematic 90-minute pilot, then incorporates tasty soap-like elements meant to animate the ensuing episodes. Although <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> no shortage of zombies and post-apocalyptic stories, producer-writer-director Frank Darabont has deftly tackled the seemingly perilous task of adapting a comic book about zombies into a viable episodic series." [...] In a {{three out of four}} star review, Linda Stasi of New York Post summarized, [...] "The zombies are truly scary and disgusting. The survivors are terrific characters, and the gore is enough for any lunatic to love." ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon release, Strangers Wrath {{received}} highly positive reviews with {{an average}} critic score of 87% at GameRankings and 88 out of 100 at Metacritic. It later was nominated for and won numerous awards for multiple media outlets.

Game Informers Andrew Reiner gave Strangers Wrath a 9/10, calling it [...] "A stunning and exquisitely realized masterpiece that delivers a gaming experience unlike any that <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> before....and is truly visionary in its delivery of gameplay." ...|$|E
5000|$|Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B, scoring lower than American Dad!s [...] "Bully for Steve". He stated, [...] "I {{thought it was}} a really well done version of a story <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> a number of times, where Lisa becomes {{involved}} with some sort of improbable cause, finds herself disappointed, and is only brought out of her bad mood when her family rallies around her." [...] but also remarked that the episode [...] "tried too hard to push for a happy ending." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad who is usually critical of the show gave the episode a positive review as well saying [...] "Finally, a good -- maybe even great -- episode. The Squirt and the Whale packed more laughs in the first few minutes Alternative Energy Expo than the entire running time of most recent eps." ...|$|E
5000|$|Not all reviews were favorable: James Poniewozik of Time stated [...] "You get {{the sense}} that the show ... is vacillating. Maybe it wants {{to be the kind of}} raw indictment/worship of {{reckless}} masculinity <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> on cable. Or maybe it wants to be a more picaresque version of House, with a little less genius and a little more self-degradation." [...] The Huffington Posts Maureen Ryan said [...] "Part of the problem is Rakes diffidence about how bad a guy Keane is supposed to be. Hes clearly a raging narcissist, yet the show deflects that aspect of his personality and tries to make him seem a little bit adorable. If were supposed to fear that the worst aspects of his personality will land him in serious trouble, the tidy resolutions of various story points in the pilot seem to preclude that possibility ... Rake isnt a bad show, it just doesnt appear to have the courage of its convictions." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on March 18, 2014, journalists Farah Ahmed and Ahmed Naif of the Maldivian Newspaper Haveeru wrote: [...] "...several residents of Kuda Huvadhoo told Haveeru on Tuesday that they saw a low flying jumbo jet at around 06:15 on March 8. They {{said that it was}} a white aircraft, with red stripes across it - which is what the Malaysia Airlines flights typically look like. Eyewitnesses from the Kuda Huvadhoo concurred that the jet was travelling North to South-East, towards the Southern tip of the Maldives - Addu. They also noted the incredibly loud noise that the flight made when it flew over the island. [...] "Ive never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. <b>Weve</b> <b>seen</b> seaplanes, but Im sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly." [...] said an eyewitness. [...] "Its not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too." [...] Mohamed Zaheem, the Island Councilor of Kuda Huvadhoo, said that the residents of the island had spoken about the incident.|$|E
5000|$|Like the manga, the anime {{has been}} well {{received}} but does not avoid criticism; in particular {{the quality of the}} animation for both seasons, including the OVAs, has attracted mixed reviews. Some of the humor and romantic elements have been derided while the English dubbing and soundtrack have been universally praised. Most reviewers took the position that, even if they dislike certain elements, the series as a whole contains something that makes them want to see more; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, who writes: The stories are really quite simple as well as being things <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> done dozens of times before. Yet it manages to infuse it {{with a great deal of}} fun and humor even if it is familiar. Theres a certain energy here that works in the shows [...] favor as well as bringing in some different elements in terms of the characters. It also doesnt hurt that several of the characters really are quite dim which is a nice contrast from the usual kind of leads. Beveridge cautioned that because the anime was designed around the non-linear format of the manga, its transitions might at first be troublesome for the viewer, but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewers largely {{praised the}} {{inclusion}} of the four Sonic the Hedgehog Mega Drive titles. Nutter acknowledged that the compilation [...] "may not be everyones cup of tea" [...] and recommended that Sonic Jam was not worth purchasing if the player already owned the included games, although he praised its value for money. Rubenstein criticised the fact that the game did not include Sonic CD or Sonic Spinball, stating that [...] "Sega could have made a far more complete Sonic collection" [...] by including more derivative titles that were released. He summarised that Sonic Jam was not a definitive Sonic experience, asserting that it had only been six years since the original Sonic the Hedgehog was released and [...] "perhaps most of us arent quite nostalgic about it yet". Game Revolutions reviewer echoed that the compilation was merely a [...] "solid set of games that <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> before", saying that the game was not recommended if the consumer was [...] "tired of rehashes", but [...] "well worth thirty or forty bucks." [...] Although Williamson noted {{that there was a lot}} of exploring for the player to do in Sonic Jam, he expressed scepticism that the majority of the game was from [...] "yesterday" [...] and there were not enough new innovations. OLearly praised the faithful and accurate replication of the four original titles, though he felt they were [...] "dated". By contrast, Ed Lomas of Computer and Video Games considered it [...] "amazing how well the games have aged". In a 2014 retrospective, the staff of GamesRadar praised Sonic Jams [...] "loving" [...] presentation, noting [...] "this was back before classic Sonic games appeared on every device known to man." ...|$|E
5000|$|Geoff Berkshire of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Repping {{a major step}} forward for Dallas-based Reel FX Animation Studios (after their anemic feature bow on last years Free Birds), the beautifully rendered CG animation brings an unusually warm and heartfelt quality to the high-tech medium and emerges as the films true calling card." [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The Book of Life is a visually stunning effort that makes up for its formulaic storyline with an enchanting atmosphere that sweeps you into its fantastical world, or in this case, three worlds." [...] Simon Abrams of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The Book of Lifes hackneyed stock plot preaches tolerance while lamely reinforcing the status quo." [...] Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, saying [...] "Overflowing with hyperactive charm and a spectacular sea of colors, it showcases some of the most breathtaking animation <b>weve</b> <b>seen</b> this decade." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "The dizzying, intricate imagery is so beautiful, and the Latin-inspired songs catchy enough that the overall effect is often enchanting." [...] Sara Stewart of The New York Post gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "Just in time for Mexicos Day of the Dead holiday comes this gloriously colorful animated musical, which almost (but not quite) makes up in visuals what it lacks in snappy dialogue." [...] Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the film a B-, saying [...] "Ultimately, what drags The Book Of Life down is its insistence on trying to update an (original) folkloric story for a contemporary audience. In practice, this means adding some pop-cultural touches that only serve to take the viewer out of the fantastic setting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Corinne Heller of E! Online dubbed [...] "Sorry" [...] as the [...] "most {{controversial}} song" [...] on Lemonade due to {{the alleged}} infidelity and [...] "Becky with the good hair" [...] mistress discussed in the lyrics. Amy Zimmerman, writing for The Daily Beast deemed [...] "Sorry" [...] {{by far the most}} iconic single and coined it as the song which [...] "introduced the world to Jay Zs most infamous alleged mistress, Becky with the good hair". She also felt that the [...] "incredibly shade-laden line" [...] was similar to [...] "Drakes iconic Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree reference". Spin journalist Greg Tate credited the line mentioning Becky for [...] "breaking the Internet" [...] and praised {{the fact that it was}} potent enough to promote the new material by the singer with [...] "few dollops of viral poesy and self-inflicted gossip-mongering". Comparing [...] "Sorry" [...] to Beyoncés own [...] "style-banger" [...] "7/11", Jillian Mapes in a review for Pitchfork noted how [...] "she turns his side-chicks into memes, which will inevitably become better call Becky with the good hair sweatshirts that Beyoncé can sell for $60 a pop".

PopMatters writer Evan Sawdey opined that [...] "the middle-finger anthem Sorry... comes from a new place, one that is distinct, palpable, and yes, relatable". NME writer Larry Bartleet wrote that the singer expresses a [...] "sorry, not sorry" [...] stance in the song and noted how in the lyrics [...] "suck on my balls", [...] "the sense of release is palpable".

This was a decrease from the previous episode, [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope", which was watched by 6.9 million American viewers. [...] "Floyd" [...] has received mixed reception from television critics. [...] "There are episodes of 30 Rock that manage to blend quasi-human plots about Liz or Jack with the zany antics of everyone else at TGS and make them all feel like {{part of the same}} show, but Floyd never quite pulled it off." [...] Alan Sepinwall, The Star-Ledger IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasnt nearly as fun as I had hoped it would be. I mean, {{if you were going to}} bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have been nice to give and Floyd a little spark."
