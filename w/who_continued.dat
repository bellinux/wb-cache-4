5|$|Abaqa died in 1282 and {{was briefly}} {{replaced}} {{by his brother}} Tekuder, who had converted to Islam. Tekuder reversed Abaqa's policy of seeking an alliance with the Franks, offering instead an alliance to the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, <b>who</b> <b>continued</b> his own advance, capturing the Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and the County of Tripoli in 1289. However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed. Arghun then revived the idea of an alliance with the West, and sent multiple envoys to Europe.|$|E

5|$|After the Declaration of Independence, Congress {{continued}} {{to manage the}} war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the Board of War in 1777. He advocated paying bonuses to Continental Army soldiers {{to encourage them to}} reenlist {{for the duration of the}} war. He called for harsh state legislation to punish Loyalists—Americans <b>who</b> <b>continued</b> to support the British crown—who Adams believed were as dangerous to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated. After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government.|$|E
5|$|Although Oriental was short-lived, {{several of}} the actors and crew it hired went on to lengthy careers. Njoo, after {{handling}} two films for Majestic in 1941, {{spent much of the}} decade in theatre before returning to directing in the mid-1950s. Fifi Young, <b>who</b> <b>continued</b> acting for Njoo until their divorce in 1945, appeared in more than eighty films before her death in 1975.

5|$|Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen {{continued}} to paint in Skagen {{until well into}} the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Two core members of the group, Drachmann and Krøyer, died in 1908 and 1909, bringing the traditional gatherings of the group to an end. There were nevertheless other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, <b>who</b> <b>continued</b> to visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Ludvig Karsten, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later.

5|$|Aside from Ariffien, <b>who</b> <b>continued</b> {{directing}} {{into the}} 1960s, none of Union's directors or producers {{returned to the}} film industry after {{the conclusion of the}} Japanese occupation in 1945. Several actors, however, continued their careers. Djoewariah, for instance, made her first film after leaving Union, Sehidup Semati (One Life, One Death), in 1949, and continued acting until the mid-1950s. The career of Soekarno, meanwhile, lasted through the 1970s; he was mostly credited as Rendra Karno after changing his name in the 1950s. Others had careers behind the screen; Kedok Ketawa star Basoeki Resobowo, for instance, became art director on films such as Darah dan Doa (The Long March; 1950).|$|E
5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, <b>who</b> <b>continued</b> {{to attack}} the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise.

Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E

Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory.
