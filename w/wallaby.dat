5|$|The swamp <b>wallaby</b> (Wallabia bicolor) {{feeds on}} the fallen fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E
5|$|The tammar <b>wallaby</b> {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the IUCN, because of its {{abundance}} and presumably stable population. However, the fragmentation of its range has led to high amounts of inbreeding and morphological abnormalities in some populations.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and <b>wallaby,</b> and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more <b>wallaby</b> or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wallabies</b> face several threats. Wild dogs, foxes, and feral {{cats are}} among their predators. Humans also pose a {{significant}} threat to <b>wallabies</b> {{due to increased}} interaction (<b>wallabies</b> can defend themselves with hard kicks, and biting). Many <b>wallabies</b> {{have been involved in}} vehicular accidents as they often feed near roads and urban areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wallabies</b> are herbivores whose diet {{consists}} {{of a wide range}} of grasses, vegetables, leaves and other foliage. Due to recent urbanization, many <b>wallabies</b> now feed in rural and urban areas. <b>Wallabies</b> cover vast distances for food and water, which is often scarce in their environment. Mobs of <b>wallabies</b> often congregate around the same water hole during the dry season.|$|R
50|$|In Ewen McKenzie's {{second year}} in charge as <b>Wallabies</b> coach, McKenzie named Ashley-Cooper as <b>Wallabies</b> vice-captain with Waratahs team-mate Michael Hooper and hooker Stephen Moore as <b>Wallabies</b> captain for the 2014 three-test June series against France.|$|R
5|$|No {{land mammals}} {{are known to}} be native to North Island, but the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) {{occasionally}} hauls out on the island's beaches, and {{it has been suggested that}} the island once had a native population of tammar <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus eugenii).|$|E
5|$|The area {{comprises}} semi-arid stony ridges, claypans and a stony plateau, {{and experiences}} a sub-tropical climate, {{with a wet}} season between January and March. The vegetation is mostly scrubland, including spinifex grasslands. The fauna is generally typical of Australian desert environments, and includes the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo, the northern nail-tail <b>wallaby,</b> and the spinifex hopping mouse.|$|E
5|$|The tammar <b>wallaby</b> {{was seen}} in the Houtman Abrolhos off Western Australia by {{survivors}} of the 1628 Batavia shipwreck, and recorded by François Pelsaert in his 1629 Ongeluckige Voyagie. It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest, who gave it the name eugenii based on where it was found; an island he knew as Ile Eugene in the Nuyts Archipelago off South Australia which is now known as St Peter Island. The island's French name was given in honour of Eugene Hamelin, commander of the ship Naturaliste; whose name is now the specific name of the tammar. The common name of the animal is derived from the thickets of the shrub locally known as tamma (Allocasuarina campestris) that sheltered it in Western Australia. The tammar is classified together with the kangaroos, wallaroos and several species of <b>wallaby</b> in the genus Macropus, and in the subgenus Notamacropus with the other wallabies, all of which have a facial stripe.|$|E

50|$|Seven {{members of}} the McLean family have {{represented}} Australia in rugby union or rugby league. His grandfather Doug McLean, Sr. and uncle Doug McLean, Jr. were dual code internationals who played for the <b>Wallabies</b> and Kangaroos. His uncle Bill captained the <b>Wallabies</b> {{in the wake of}} World War II and his uncle Jack toured with the <b>Wallabies</b> in 1946. His brother Jeff and cousin Peter also played for the <b>Wallabies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pademelons, <b>wallabies,</b> and {{kangaroos}} {{are very}} alike in body structure, {{and the three}} names refer to the three different size groups. Besides their smaller size, pademelons can be distinguished from <b>wallabies</b> by their shorter, thicker, and sparsely haired tails. Like <b>wallabies,</b> they ambulate by hopping.|$|R
5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar <b>wallaby</b> called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species that}} have been {{observed}} foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-plumed honeyeater (L.penicillatus), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus), noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants. The swamp <b>wallaby</b> (Wallabia bicolor) eats new shoots that grow from lignotubers after bushfire.|$|E
5|$|North Island is {{the northernmost}} {{island in the}} Houtman Abrolhos, a coral reef {{archipelago}} in the Indian Ocean {{off the coast of}} Mid West Western Australia. Located about 14km (9mi) from the nearest island group, {{it is one of the}} largest islands in the Houtman Abrolhos, and one of the few to support dune systems. It has relatively diverse flora dominated by chenopod shrubs and fauna that includes the introduced tammar <b>wallaby,</b> around seven species of reptile, and about 15 resident bird species.|$|E
40|$|Dama <b>wallabies</b> (Macropus eugenii) are an {{introduced}} pest in New Zealand requiring control. Historically, {{sodium fluoroacetate}} (1080) {{has been used}} to control <b>wallabies</b> but there is increasing resistance to this method of pest control. Pen trials have shown that Feratox® cyanide pellets are an effective and humane toxin for use on dama <b>wallabies.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effectiveness of these cyanide pellets in field trials for controlling dama <b>wallabies.</b> Twenty-four dama <b>wallabies</b> were captured, radio-collared, and released in a 32 -ha block of degraded native forest south-east of Rotorua. Twelve of the <b>wallabies</b> left the study area within 3 days of being released and were subsequently located at least 3 km from the area during the trial. Two weeks of prefeeding was carried out with non-toxic baits that consisted of 213 paste bait (Connovation, Auckland, NZ) mixed with a molasses powder with a single placebo Feratox-sized pellet inside; this was followed by the presentation of Feratox pellets in the same bait formulation. Of the 12 collared <b>wallabies</b> that were at the study site when toxic baits were laid, 11 were killed with Feratox; 20 uncollared resident <b>wallabies</b> were also killed. These results support the use of Feratox cyanide pellets for control of dama <b>wallabies...</b>|$|R

50|$|Sio {{made his}} run-on debut at loosehead prop against the All Blacks during the winning final of the 2015 Rugby Championship, after {{a pair of}} {{impressive}} cameos from the reserves bench against South Africa and Argentina. Sio was named in the <b>Wallabies</b> 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where he supplanted most-capped <b>Wallabies</b> prop James Slipper as the <b>Wallabies</b> first choice loosehead. He currently is now a regular in the <b>Wallabies</b> starting XV at loosehead prop.|$|R
5|$|The foregut of the tammar <b>wallaby</b> {{contains}} {{species of}} bacteria {{belonging to the}} phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, species of the family Succinivibrionaceae are the most abundant and a new species named WG–1 was discovered. WG–1 is a capnophilic bacterium. This has important environmental implications as the bacteria produces less methane than others and does not require CO2 to survive. Research suggests that this information {{could be used to}} reduce carbon production in livestock.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can {{regenerate}} through a ground-stored seed bank. Seedlings mostly germinate {{within two years}} of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers. Swamp wallabies are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds are spread in <b>wallaby</b> faeces. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.|$|E
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered <b>wallaby</b> grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E
50|$|Others {{are skeptical}} that the <b>wallabies</b> even {{pose a threat}} to the capercaillies, as they have lived {{together}} for at least 60 years, with no obvious harm done by the <b>wallabies.</b> They also argue that the capercaillies could fly to another island if the <b>wallabies</b> were creating too many problems.|$|R
5000|$|Bledisloe Glacier (...) is {{a glacier}} flowing north west between All-Blacks Nunataks and <b>Wallabies</b> Nunataks, {{west of the}} Churchill Mountains. It was named in {{association}} with the adjacent All-Blacks and <b>Wallabies</b> Nunataks, and specifically named after the Bledisloe Cup, which is contested between the New Zealand and Australian rugby union teams, the All-Blacks and the <b>Wallabies.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2017, Jones took up an {{invitation}} to coach the Barbarians against the Classic <b>Wallabies</b> in Lismore and the <b>Wallabies</b> in Sydney during the 2017 end-of-year rugby union internationals.|$|R
5|$|Most of the region's fauna {{is typical}} of desert environments. Species include the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo (also known as the euro), the {{northern}} nail-tail <b>wallaby,</b> and the spinifex hopping mouse. The central pebble-mound mouse also occurs in the region, and other mammal species including the Forrest's mouse, desert mouse and short-beaked echidna have been predicted by biologists to occur on the station. The station may lie {{within the range of}} the critically endangered night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis). There is relatively high diversity and abundance of reptiles, including the military dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis gularis) and the sand goanna (Varanus gouldii flavirufus).|$|E
5|$|Stokes {{explicitly}} {{stated the}} tammar <b>wallaby</b> to be absent from North Island in 1840, {{and it was}} not recorded by the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition in 1913. It was apparently introduced to the island in the 1920s, as early fishermen reported seeing it between 1928 and 1930. This introduction failed, possibly due to overgrazing. The species was not found by Serventy during his 1945 visit, nor by Storr in 1959, but the latter found plenty of remains, mostly mandibles. Storr interpreted these remains as predating the 1920s introduction, suggesting that a native population of tammars became extinct on the island before 1840. Albert Russell Main agreed, but the theory has not been accepted by later researchers.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this central}} motif are {{arranged}} elements of eight other stories, {{all of them}} represented {{at least in part}} by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock <b>wallaby,</b> or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of the tammar <b>wallaby</b> exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains {{were found in the}} Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population. A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population. The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a <b>Wallaby</b> jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cultivars {{brought into}} {{cultivation}} in Australia {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century are perennials. 'Dargan Hill Monarch' was the first of these, and many more have followed. Profusely flowering, these grow in many colours including white, yellow, orange, bronze, pink, and red. Their commercial lifespans are generally around three years. Queensland-based company Aussie Winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as Sundaze. Plants of this series usually have larger leaves. This range won the Gran premio d'oro at the Euroflora exposition in Geneva in 2001, for the best new plant series in the previous three years. 'Florabella Gold', a member of the Florabella series, won the award for best new pot plant (vegetative) in the Society of American Florists' competition of 1999. The <b>Wallaby</b> cultivars are range of taller forms with narrow leaves and white, yellow or pink flowers. Other commercial ranges include the Nullarbor series, and Queensland Federation daisies, including 'Wanetta Sunshine' and 'Golden Nuggets'.|$|E

50|$|He next {{played for}} the <b>Wallabies</b> in a Bledisloe Cup match against the All Blacks in Sydney in 1992. Australia lost 23-26, though Herbert scored one of the Wallabies' two tries. He also played in the 1993 Bledisloe match at Carisbrook, Dunedin, which the <b>Wallabies</b> lost 25-10. His last match for the <b>Wallabies</b> was the 28-20 victory over South Africa in 1993 at Ballymore, Brisbane.|$|R
50|$|The banded {{hare-wallaby}} (Lagostrophus fasciatus) {{is thought to}} be the last remaining member of the once-numerous subfamily Sthenurinae, and although once common across southern Australia, is now restricted to two islands off the Western Australian coast which are free of introduced predators. It is not as closely related to the other hare <b>wallabies</b> (genus Lagorchestes) as the hare <b>wallabies</b> are to the other <b>wallabies.</b>|$|R
