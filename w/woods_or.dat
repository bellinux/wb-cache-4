5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E
5|$|The common stinkhorn can {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of Europe and North America, and {{it has also been}} collected in Asia (including China, Taiwan, and India), Costa Rica, Iceland, Tanzania, and southeast Australia. In North America, it is most common west of the Mississippi River; Ravenel's stinkhorn (Phallus ravenelii) is more common to the east. The fungus is associated with rotting wood, and as such it is most commonly encountered in deciduous woods where it fruits from summer to late autumn, though it may also be found in conifer <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> even grassy areas such as parks and gardens. It may also form mycorrhizal associations with certain trees.|$|E
25|$|According to Tacitus, the Germanic tribes {{think of}} temples as {{unsuitable}} habitations for gods, {{and they do}} not represent them as idols in human shape. Instead of temples, they consecrate <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> groves to individual gods.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Irish Bend, {{also known}} as Nerson's <b>Woods</b> <b>or</b> Franklin, was fought between Union Major General Nathaniel Prentice Banks against Confederate Major General Richard Taylor during Banks's {{operations}} against the Bayou Teche region near Franklin, the seat of St. Mary Parish in southern Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|This {{ended his}} cricket career which had {{consisted}} of just 10 first class matches {{in which he}} took 57 wickets {{at an average of}} 15. He was not as fast a bowler as Float <b>Woods</b> <b>or</b> Archie Cumberbatch but was certainly more accurate and used a clever variation of pace. To get employment he had to emigrate to Panama where he worked as a sanitary inspector for 40 years. He deliberately returned to Barbados for his final days.|$|E

25|$|The night before, {{a terrific}} storm lashed {{the entire area}} badly. Prior to the battle, General Hill, seeing the rough terrain of the area as a hazard, had his men place a white cloth around their hats as a {{precaution}} {{to serve as a}} battle-badge. As it turned out, this was a great idea that may have aided immensely in the outcome... All were in dense marshy <b>woods,</b> <b>or</b> on the terribly muddy road wading through water two to three feet deep and through thick underbrush.|$|E
25|$|Mudflats exist {{along the}} {{shoreline}} of the Royal National Park which is substantial enough to sustain a simplistic system of mangrove woodlands especially along the Port Hacking Estuary with the occasional clump of stunted tree on the seaward coastline in sheltered coves. Vegetation in the mangroves consists almost exclusively of the grey mangrove (Avicennia marina var. australasica) growing up to 4m {{as well as the}} river mangrove (Aegiceras corniculatum) which is usually only found on the shoreward edge of mangrove <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> in the brackish end of the Port Hacking Estuary.|$|E
25|$|The Union {{soldiers}} were riding open gondola or platform cars {{as the train}} backed down the track toward Vienna. As the train rounded the curve, {{one of the men}} spotted some Confederate cavalrymen on a nearby hill. As the Ohio soldiers prepared to shoot at the horsemen, the Confederates fired their cannons from their hiding place around the curve. The Union force suffered several casualties but were spared from incurring even more by the slightly high initial cannon shots and by quickly jumping from the slowmoving train and either running into nearby <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> moving into protected positions near the cars.|$|E

25|$|Twelve {{years went}} by before Raleigh {{decided to find out}} what {{happened}} to his colony. Led by Samuel Mace, this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering. However, Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip, and Mace's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England. By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists, the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island. By this time, having been arrested for treason, Raleigh was unable to send any further missions.|$|E
25|$|Linguists have {{compared}} the many translations and even {{editions of the}} same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of The Little Prince in Korean, {{and there are also}} about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled Prince From a Star, while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of The Little Prince. By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists can identify the source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine <b>Woods,</b> <b>or</b> from a number of adapted sources.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil <b>Woods</b> <b>or</b> Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

25|$|The Mongols {{also used}} {{deception}} {{very well in}} their wars. For instance, when approaching a mobile army the units would be split into three or more army groups, each trying to outflank and surprise their opponents. This created many battlefield scenarios for the opponents where the Mongols would seem to appear {{out of nowhere and}} there were seemingly more of them than in actuality. Flanking and/or feigned retreat if the enemy could not be handled easily {{was one of the most}} practiced techniques. Other techniques used commonly by the Mongols were completely psychological and were used to entice/lure enemies into vulnerable positions by showing themselves from a hill or some other predetermined locations, then disappearing into the <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> behind hills while the Mongols' flank troops already strategically positioned would appear as if out of nowhere from the left, right and/or from their rear. During the initial states of battlefield contact, while camping in close proximity of their enemies at night, they would feign numerical superiority by ordering each soldier to light at least five fires, which would appear to the enemy scouts and spies that their force was almost five times larger than it actually was.|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr {{suggested}} that in January 2013 that no new movies should {{be released in}} January. Instead, [...] "studios would have to rerelease their most underrated entertainments {{from the previous year}} for a second chance." [...] He gave The Cabin in the <b>Woods</b> <b>or</b> Chronicle, itself a January release in 2012, as examples of such films. Failing that happening, he wrote that he was using home media to catch up on older films.|$|E
500|$|After the United States entered World War I in 1917, the Carpenter-O'Brien Lumber Company {{was sold}} to Brooks-Scanlon Corporation. By 1928, Brooks-Scanlon was {{operating}} in four Florida counties and producing [...] of lumber. This locomotive was probably used to haul logs into the mill from the <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> to switch the yard around the Eastport plant, or both.

500|$|The {{painted turtle}} hibernates by burying itself, {{either on the}} bottom of a body of water, near water in the shore-bank or the burrow of a muskrat, or in <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> pastures.

Adaptations of its blood chemistry, brain, heart, and particularly its shell allow the turtle to survive extreme lactic acid buildup while oxygen-deprived.|$|E
500|$|The {{barn owl}} is a bird of open country such as {{farmland}} or grassland with some interspersed woodland, usually at altitudes below [...] but occasionally {{as high as}} [...] in the tropics. This owl prefers to hunt {{along the edges of}} <b>woods</b> <b>or</b> in rough grass strips adjoining pasture. It has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters the ground, alert to the sounds made by potential prey. Like most owls, the barn owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its flight feathers and a hairlike fringe to the trailing edges help to break up the flow of air over the wings, thereby reducing turbulence and the noise that accompanies it. Hairlike extensions to the barbules of its feathers, which give the plumage a soft feel, also minimise noise produced during wingbeats. The behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighbouring subspecies, as shown {{in the case of the}} European T. a. guttata and [...] T. a. alba that probably evolved, respectively, in allopatric glacial refugia in southeastern Europe, and in Iberia or southern France.|$|E
