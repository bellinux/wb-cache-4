40|$|The study {{investigated}} the teachers’ opinions about inclusion {{of children who are}} blind; the factors which may influence their opinions and what they think can be done to include children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in primary schools. It was a qualitative study which purposely involved five teachers from two primary schools. Data was collected through interviews. The centre of interest in the study was on the acceptance of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> by the teachers; participation of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in classroom and outdoor activities, benefits of placing children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in mainstream primary schools, the challenges of including children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream and what teachers think ca be done to overcome such challenges. The study findings revealed that the nature of attitudes the teachers had towards children who <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> additional disability and class size determined the teachers’ acceptance of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> The teachers also believed that children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> helped to participate in school activities through classroom and physical environmental modifications; curriculum modifications and provision of specialised equipment. Teachers felt that placement of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream can make them achieve social benefits; academic benefits and acquire special skills. The study findings also revealed that for successful inclusion of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> teachers needed support in the provision of special specialised equipment; collaboration with other professionals; construction and equipping the resource rooms where remedial support for children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> exercised. The following challenges were expressed by the teachers: Lack of skills and competence, large class sizes and lack of specialised equipment. In order to overcome these challenges, teachers used various methods of teaching for example peer teaching, cooperative learning and team teaching. It is suggested that training and re-training of teachers in the filed of Special Needs Education, provision of specialised equipment, recruitment of more teachers and awareness seminars may help in the inclusion of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind...</b>|$|R

5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E
5|$|His father, Niccolò Polo, a merchant, traded {{with the}} Near East, {{becoming}} wealthy and achieving great prestige. Niccolò {{and his brother}} Maffeo set off on a trading voyage before Marco's birth. In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the Venetian quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured Venetian citizens <b>were</b> <b>blinded,</b> while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{resistance}} revived {{under the}} rule of the Cometopuli dynasty, but the new emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal. Basil's first expedition against Bulgaria, however, resulted in a humiliating defeat at the Gates of Trajan. For the next few years, the emperor would be preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia, while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans. The war dragged on for nearly twenty years. The Byzantine victories of Spercheios and Skopje decisively weakened the Bulgarian army, and in annual campaigns, Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds. At the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 the Bulgarians were annihilated: their army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men <b>were</b> <b>blinded,</b> with the hundredth man left with one eye so he could lead his compatriots home. When Tsar Samuil saw the broken remains of his once formidable army, he died of shock. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered, and the country became part of the Empire. This victory restored the Danube frontier, which had not been held {{since the days of the}} emperor Heraclius.|$|E

25|$|The Templars {{sought to}} unseat Bohemond VII by {{supporting}} Guy II Embriaco. Bohemond VII responded by sacking the Templar house in Tripoli and forests at Montroque. This action led to indecisive {{fighting over the}} following months at Botron, Fort Nephin, Sidon and at sea. In 1282, Guy II Embriaco and the Templars were ambushed in Tripoli. Guy II Embriaco, his brothers and cousins were imprisoned at Fort Nephin and left to starve. His followers <b>were</b> <b>blinded.</b> The Templars were summarily executed.|$|E
25|$|Low-level {{development}} {{began in}} 1939 but was greatly sped after {{the introduction of}} the cavity magnetron in early 1940. This operated at 9.1cm wavelength (3GHz), much shorter than the 1.5m wavelength of the earlier AI Mk. IV. Shorter wavelengths allowed it to use smaller and much more directional antennas. This provided the important advantage of allowing the radar to avoid ground reflections simply by pointing the antenna upward. The Mk. IV's semi-directional antennas <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> by noise from the signal reflecting off the ground while flying at low altitude, while the Mk. VIII could see anything above the fighter's altitude.|$|E
25|$|However, a major {{defeat at}} the battle of Spercheios in 996 {{signaled}} that the tide of the war had begun to change in the Byzantines' favour. From 1001 onwards, Basil II launched yearly campaigns into Bulgarian territory, methodically taking important cities such as Preslav, Pliska and Vidin, and inflicting several defeats on Samuil. In addition, in 1003 Samuil was involved in a war with the Kingdom of Hungary. After years of campaigning, in 1014, in the decisive battle of Kleidion the Bulgarian army was crushed and 14,000 captured Bulgarian soldiers <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> and sent to Samuil, who died at the sight of his army on 6 October.|$|E

The Ayyubid army was arrayed in three divisions: the centre under Saladin, the right under his nephew Al-Muzaffar Umar (Taki ad-Din) and the left, {{commanded}} by Gökböri. The Franks came under fire from Muslim mounted archers from the division commanded by Gökböri, who had been resupplied with 400 loads of arrows that had been brought up during the night. Gerard and Raynald advised Guy to form battle lines and attack, which was done by Guy's brother Amalric. Raymond led the first division with Raymond of Antioch, the son of Bohemund III of Antioch, while Balian and Joscelin III of Edessa formed the rearguard.|$|E
25|$|At Dona Catarina’s request, {{the wounded}} Captain-General was nursed and treated well by King Vimaladharmasuriya. But {{three days later}} he succumbed to his injuries, after entrusting his small son to the King.

There were five Portuguese captains among the captives: Francisco Pereira Deca, the brothers Vicente and Luís Sobrinho, Filipe Toscano, and Rui Deca. The latter two were executed during their captivity. Of the priests who were among the prisoners—three Franciscans and one Jesuit—two were released later. Enough of another group of captives <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> so as to leave only one eye for each five men, and these were sent back to Colombo holding one another by the hand. The rest were forced to build fortifications, which were to be tested in the Campaign of Balana from 1602 to 1603.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous persons to have visited the city in this period was Marco Polo, who ended his {{overland}} return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown Venice with a ship; passing by Constantinople (Istanbul) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261. A year earlier, in 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo Polo (the father and uncle of Marco Polo) were residing in Constantinople, then the capital of the Latin Empire. They foresaw a political change, liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. Their decision proved wise, as Constantinople was recaptured in 1261 by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, who promptly burned the Venetian quarter in the city and reestablished the Byzantine Empire.

25|$|Nikephoros's regime, however, {{quickly became}} unpopular, both {{due to his}} focus on {{military}} affairs {{to the detriment of}} the economy and for his religious policies. In December 969, he was murdered by a group of disaffected generals led by his nephew and one-time protégé John Tzimiskes, with the connivance of Empress Theophano. The Phokades were dismissed from their posts and titles and exiled by the new regime. Bardas Phokas the Younger, the younger son of the kouropalates Leo and former doux of Chaldia, escaped and rose up in revolt in 970, but was defeated, tonsured, and exiled to Chios, while in 971 Leo and his eldest son the patrikios Nikephoros <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> and their property confiscated. One member of the family had a different fate: Leo's daughter Sophia Phokaina had married Constantine Skleros, the brother of Bardas Skleros. Constantine was Tzimiskes's brother-in-law from his first marriage and a close ally of the new emperor. Their daughter, Theophano, was married in 972 to the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II (r. 973–983).|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{supporters}} of the pope-elect Stephen began brutally to attack key members of Constantine’s regime, including Constantine himself, who was hounded {{through the streets of}} Rome, with heavy weights attached to his feet. Bishop Theodore, Constantine’s Vice-dominus, was blinded and had his tongue cut out, while Constantine’s brother, Passivus, was also blinded. After Constantine was officially dethroned on August 6, Stephen was consecrated pope on the following day, August 7, 768. Retributions continued even after the consecration of Stephen; the town of Alatri revolted in support of Constantine, and after its capture, the key members of the revolt <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> and had their tongues ripped out. Then on the orders of the papal Chartularius, Gratiosus, Constantine was removed from his monastic cell, blinded, and left on the streets of Rome with specific instructions that no-one should aid him. Finally, on a charge of conspiring to kill Christophorus and many other nobles, with the intent of handing over the city to the Lombards, the priest Waldipert, who was the prime mover in the elevation of the Antipope Philip, was arrested, blinded, and soon died of his wounds.|$|E
500|$|Little else is {{recorded}} about Ealdorman Ælfhelm's career before his death. Notice of the latter, with the blinding {{of his two}} sons, comes in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which related under the year 1006:In this year Archbishop Ælfric died and Bishop Ælfheah succeeded him to the archiepiscopal see. In the same year Wulfgeat was deprived of all his property, and Wulfheah and Ufegeat <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> and Ealdorman Ælfhelm killed. The Worcester Chronicle, which for this period consists of entries taken from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle supplemented with extra information, gives an expanded saga-like version of this account, attributing Ælfhelm's death to Eadric Streona:The crafty and treacherous Eadric Streona, plotting to deceive the noble ealdorman Ælfhelm, prepared a great feast for him at Shrewsbury at which, when he came as a guest, Eadric greeted {{him as if he}} were an intimate friend. But on the third or fourth day of the feast, when an ambush had been prepared, he took him into the wood to hunt. When all were busy with the hunt, one Godwine Porthund (which means the town dog) a Shrewsbury butcher, whom Eadric had dazzled long before with great gifts and many promises so that he might perpetrate the crime, suddenly leapt out from the ambush, and execrably slew the ealdorman Ælfhelm. After a short space of time his sons, Wulfheah and Ufegeat, <b>were</b> <b>blinded,</b> at King Æthelred’s command, at Cookham, where he himself was then staying. This material in the Worcester Chronicle seems to have been part of a lost saga about Eadric Streona, not extant but used by various surviving 11th- and 12th-century sources. Kapelle thought Ælfhelm's murder, conducted without King Æthelred's displeasure, was the result of suspect loyalty in the face of Scandinavian invasions.|$|E

40|$|Studies of how {{children}} who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> acquire and use language have focused less on cognitive compensations {{and more on}} delays in development. Vision {{is important in the}} establishment of early communicative patterns, and sighted children regularly use contextual visual information, such as a speaker's gestures and eye gaze, to make sense of speech that is directed at them (Mills, 1988). Some researchers have argued that, in the absence of vision, children may be expected to have more difficulty understanding concepts and the relationships between them and in acquiring generalizations about language and the way it works (Andersen, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1993). In contrast, {{it has been argued that}} linguistic experience may be more important for children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> than for sighted children and that children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> may pay more attention to language (Chomsky, 1990; Perez-Pereira & Castro, 1997).

500|$|After Empress Irene deposed {{her son in}} 797, the {{brothers}} were visited at the monastery by some of their supporters and persuaded to seek refuge in the Hagia Sophia.

No uprising in their support materialized, and Irene's trusted eunuch advisor Aetios managed to extricate {{the brothers}} {{and send them to}} exile in Athens. There, they were again the subject of a conspiracy: in March 799, a certain Akameros, [...] "archon of the Slavs in Belzetia" [...] in southern Thessaly, together with local troops from the theme of Hellas (to which Athens belonged), planned to proclaim one of them emperor.

500|$|Géza I died on 25 April 1077. Since Géza's sons, Coloman and Álmos, were minors, his {{supporters}} proclaimed Ladislaus king instead.

Although the Illuminated Chronicle emphasizes that Ladislaus [...] "never placed the crown upon his head, for he desired a heavenly crown {{rather than the}} earthly crown of a mortal king", all his coins depict him wearing a crown, suggesting that Ladislaus was actually crowned around 1078. Shortly after his coronation, Ladislaus promulgated two law books, which incorporated the decisions of an assembly of the [...] "magnates of the kingdom", held in Pannonhalma. The majority of these laws were draconian measures to defend private property, showing that Ladislaus primarily focused on internal consolidation and security during {{the first years of}} his reign. Those who were caught stealing were to be executed, and even criminals who committed minor offenses against property rights <b>were</b> <b>blinded</b> or sold as slaves.
