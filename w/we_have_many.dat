500|$|Besides {{the above}} {{discussion}} about contributions and caveats, the summit was noticed to paint an optimistic {{picture of the}} war in Afghanistan and Afghanistan's future. For instance, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that [...] "real progress" [...] had been made in Afghanistan and that this was the main highlight of the summit. He strongly disagreed with visions of [...] "doom and gloom," [...] and added that five years after the defeat of the Taliban regime, Afghanistan had become a democratic society that is [...] "no longer a threat to the world." [...] He also believed that the defeat of the insurgency {{was only a matter of}} time, stating that the war in Afghanistan [...] "is winnable, it is being won, but it is not yet won because, of course, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> challenges in Afghanistan." [...] In his opinion, these challenges included besides military engagement mainly reconstruction and development work.|$|E

2500|$|Waldheim had {{previously}} {{claimed to have}} received a medical discharge after being wounded in winter 1942. His aides at the United Nations even accused the Israeli mission of spreading rumors that he supported the Nazis. However, Israeli ambassador Yehuda Zvi Blum said, [...] "We don't believe Waldheim ever supported the Nazis and we never said he did. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> differences with him, but that isn't one of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sunday {{school and}} Bible study classes were conducted, with various {{religious}} denominations {{making use of}} the main hall for their services in sequence. De facto leader of the community Warren Chase emphasized the religious harmony {{of members of the}} phalanx, noting in a letter that [...] "although <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> members of different religious societies, they all seem determined to lay aside metaphysical differences, and make a united social effort, founded on the fundamental principles of religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joel David Hamkins {{proposes a}} multiverse {{approach}} to set theory {{and argues that}} [...] "the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, {{it can no longer}} be settled in the manner formerly hoped for." [...] (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, Saharon Shelah wrote that he does [...] "not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC." [...] (Shelah 2003).|$|E
2500|$|The {{butterfly}} effect is most familiar {{in terms of}} weather; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos {{is important in the}} development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: [...] "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Simeulue was not {{the tragedy}} many {{government}} officials feared despite its proximity to the quake epicenter. Only five of the 70,000 villagers on Simeulue were killed, {{all of them in}} the earthquake that struck at 7.55am last Sunday. Although 90% of the buildings along its coast have been destroyed, nobody perished in the five-meter-high walls of water that followed. Local traditions seem to have saved them. Mayor Darmili said villagers on the island were used to earthquakes and tsunamis. A big earthquake last struck in 2002. [...] "Thousands of our people were killed by a tsunami in 1907 and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> earthquakes here," [...] he said.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>many</b> notable dinners that winter, but {{our long}} {{anticipated}} visit to Mark Twain's house in Riverdale stands out above them all.
