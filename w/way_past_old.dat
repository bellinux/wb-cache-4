50|$|Mill Run's {{headwaters}} lie in {{a hollow}} between South Branch Mountain (3028 feet) and Nathaniel Mountain (2739 feet) in the Nathaniel Mountain Wildlife Management Area. The stream runs northeast, then northwest, where it is met {{with a number of}} trails and old lumbering roads used by fishermen and hunters that utilize the WMA. Two small unnamed streams also born from hollows in Nathaniel Mountain join Mill Run as it flows toward Peterkin Conference Center. After passing through Peterkin, Mill Run adjoins Hampshire Park and its 4-H camp facilities such as its council circle and makes its <b>way</b> <b>past</b> the <b>old</b> Pancake Schoolhouse. Mill Run then flows under South Branch River Road and empties into the South Branch near Riverview Farm.|$|R

[...] Allan's bright blue eyes twinkled mischievously. Inspired by a sudden idea, he stole softly {{to the end of the}} shrubbery, darted round the corner of it, and, {{vaulting}} over a low ring fence, found himself in a trim little paddock, crossed by a gravel walk. At a short distance down the wall stood a young lady, with her back toward him, trying to force her <b>way</b> <b>past</b> an impenetrable <b>old</b> man, with a rake in his hand, who stood obstinately in front of her, shaking his head.|$|R

[...] I flew to the main shaft, and called Mr. Alder. He was incredulous, but Lady Lucy insisted. A man went down, and the sound was certain. No words can be made out. They are working to meet them. Lucy burst into tears, and threw her arms round my neck as soon as she heard this man's report; but oh! thankful as we are, it is more cruel than ever not to know who is saved, and this letter must go to-night without waiting for more.|$|R
