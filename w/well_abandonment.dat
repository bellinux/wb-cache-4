40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} working on the Norwegian continental shelf have the past years increased the focus on decommissioning of fields, after several years with attention to increase and enhance oil recovery. The topic plug and abandonment has been well-recognized by the Norwegian authorities, the oil and {{gas industry}} and the public media due to the expected cost which will affect both Norwegian taxpayers, licence partners and operators working on the shelf. There has been a large emphasis to cut these cost, where companies are currently developing new solutions to enhance the process to plug and abandon wells. The concept “rig-less” P&A have been expressed as a futuristic goal from “Norwegian Oil and Gas” in their roadmap for new P&A technologies [1]. This thesis investigates performance differences of a purpose-built P&A unit based on previous performed <b>well</b> <b>abandonments</b> with regular jack-up rigs. The unit is designed to be a cost-efficient rig alternative to regular jack-up rigs, which is designed to perform heavier well operations, such as drilling. The study focus on P&A operations of offshore platform wells, and includes estimates of cost differences between the chosen concept and a standard jack-up rig. Variables like tripping speed, pumping capacities, tubing retrieval efficiency and durations to mobilize equipment will determine the performance of the unit. A lot of the time spent during a P&A operation is related to tripping of pipe. Wireline and coiled tubing are equipment that reduce tripping time, but will the relationship between cost and performance improvements be satisfactory? The findings of the study indicate that employment of the chosen rig design concept provides better economics in the specific <b>well</b> <b>abandonments</b> used for the comparison. There are several factors which determines if the combination of coiled tubing and wireline yet are the preferred solution. With the “Norwegian Oil and Gas” ambitions to develop more technology to increase rig-less P&A scope, this combination may be the preferred solution, to cope with the future needs...|$|R

5000|$|Abandonment {{costs are}} costs {{associated}} with the abandonment of a business venture. This term traditionally applied to the process of abandoning an under-producing or non-producing oil or gas well. In that context, it means the removal of equipment, plugging of the well with cement, any environmental clean-up, etc. necessary to shut the well down. It is occasionally referred to as [...] "Removal and Abandonment" [...] or R & A. The objective of <b>well</b> <b>abandonment</b> is to ensure that no hydrocarbons leak into surface water or into the atmosphere. The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the United States is about $5000 (~Texas average cost in year 2000). If a well has developed a leak that allows gas to flow up the outside of the well casing, finding and correcting the leak can push the cost of abandonment beyond $100,000. Wells that have been used as injectors or have been subject to fracking operation are more likely to develop leaks because the injected substances can create channels that permit uncontrolled flow outside the casing.|$|E
5000|$|While neither {{field is}} {{producing}} {{in the present}} day, periodic {{attempts have been made}} to find and cap leaking wells from the operations in the late 19th and early 20th century. In those early years of the petroleum industry, there was little to no regulation of operating practice, and abandoned wells were often filled with whatever was available - earth, wooden poles, old mattresses and other rubbish were commonly stuffed down the holes, but these methods are ineffective for long-term plugging of an oil well. [...] Since petroleum migrates upwards from pressurized source regions, over time it will find any open pathways to the surface; in the case of natural gas, this can cause an explosion hazard. Modern <b>well</b> <b>abandonment</b> techniques involve cutting off a well casing well below ground surface and capping with concrete, forming a permanent seal. Between 1960 and 1968, eighty old wells were located and capped in an attempt to stop the slow leaking of oil into the ocean. More wells were located, cut, filled, and capped in 1975 and 1993.|$|E

Salt tectonics plays a central role in these failures. To explore the geomechanical interactions between salt and the surrounding sand and shale formations, scientists have simulated the stresses in and around salt diapirs in the Gulf of Mexico using non-linear finite element geomechanical modeling. In this paper, we describe novel techniques developed to visualize the simulated subsurface stress field. We present an adaptation of the Mohr diagram, a traditional paper-and-pencil graphical method long used by the material mechanics community for estimating coordinate transformations for stress tensors, as a new tensor glyph for dynamically exploring tensor variables within three-dimensional finite element models.

40|$|There {{are many}} fields on Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) that {{approach}} {{end of their}} design life. Based on feasibility studies, life of some fields is prolonged while it is shortened for others. Since early days there was strong focus on drilling wells faster. Safety aspect came some time later. Little or no attention at all was given for future <b>well</b> <b>abandonment</b> activities. During the last decades, {{a lot of experience}} has been gained by operator companies when it comes to permanently plugging both old and ‘newly’ designed wells on NCS. Some old wells were abandoned in the manner of days while others required extensive resources to abandon. The common challenges were ranging from lack of basic well data to well design and subsurface conditions that were unfavourable for <b>well</b> <b>abandonment,</b> hence requiring additional efforts. <b>Well</b> <b>abandonment</b> does not generate direct revenue neither for operator companies nor for society.

The primary objective of die IOGCC`s effort is to examine the potential impact of an aggressive and focused program of research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) and technology transfer on future oil recovery in the United States. As part of a larger effort by the IOGCC, this report focuses on the potential economic benefits of improved oil recovery in the state of California. Individual reports for seven other oil producing states and a national report have been separately published by the IOGCC. Several major technical insights for state and Federal policymakers and regulators can be reached from this analysis. Overall, <b>well</b> <b>abandonments</b> and more stringent environmental regulations could limit economic access to the nation`s known, remaining oil resource. The high risk of near-term abandonment and the significant benefits of future application of improved oil recovery technoloy, clearly point to a need for more aggressive transfer of currently available technologies to domestic oil producers. Development and application of advanced oil recovery technologies could leave even greater benefits to the nation. A collaborative, focused RD&D effort, integrating the resources and expertise of industry, state and local governments, and the Federal government, is clearly warranted.

40|$|On the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) today, {{there are}} 1033 subsea wells that are {{classified}} {{with the status}} online/operational, Drilling, Predrilled, Suspended and Closed[1] and these subsea wells {{will have to be}} permanently plugged and abandoned (PP&A) at some point. When the revenue of these subsea wells decreases and the cost is the driving factor, we are left with two options; permanently plug the reservoir section and reuse the slot by drilling a sidetrack or PP&A the subsea well. P&A operations is associated with high cost for the operating companies, licensees and the Norwegian taxpayers. To maintain the production on the NCS, one have to drill new wells to ensure new discoveries. However, as new wells are drilled others have to be PP&A. By using a riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessel to conduct P&A operations, one can exclude the use of expensive mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) and consequently maintain the drilling activity on the NCS. The current practice is to use a semi-submersible rig with marine riser to perform the res-ervoir – and intermediate abandonment. By utilizing the current practice and convert it to the new concept of conducting PP&A from a RLWI vessel, we could find the technology gap and the best suited subsea well candidates. The intention is to perform full riserless P&A operations using wireline, coiled tubing and main winch (i. e. a rig-less approach) combined with additional equipment. A large proportion of the current and future subsea wells on the NCS and {{in the rest of the}} world will be potential candidates for riserless PP&A with a RLWI vessel. Riserless P&A operations of subsea wells with low <b>well</b> <b>abandonment</b> complexity will most likely reduce the overall P&A expenditures because RLWI vessels has a lower day rate and an effective method of performing the P&A operation.

30|$|Conventional {{hydrothermal}} geothermal wells with a {{depth of}} around 3000  m and temperatures of 340  °C can yield from 4 up to 10 MWe. Recent studies have proven that productivity might be increased {{by a factor of}} 10, if fluids from supercritical resources had been extracted (Friðleifsson et al. 2005, 2014 a, b). This is due to the increased enthalpy, lower viscosity, and density of supercritical fluids that allow for much higher flow rates. The longevity of a geothermal well drilled into the supercritical resource depends significantly on the appropriate drilling and well completion technology. Deep and high-temperature drilling projects in countries such as Iceland, Italy, Kenya, Japan, Greece, USA, and Mexico have all reached critical temperatures and encountered, in the majority, highly corrosive and hostile fluids. Such extreme reservoir conditions promoted damage to the casing material, cement sheaths, surface equipment, and led to serious well failures and in many cases to <b>well</b> <b>abandonment.</b> These drilling campaigns created an acute need for improvements in drilling and well completion technologies being currently used for high-temperature wells.|$|E
