This article summarized and analyzed force of the forklift's <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> according to the typical working conditions of forklift, and calculated the load of various working conditions. It provided the correct boundary conditions for the finite element analysis of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> [1]. After the analysis of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim's</b> three typical conditions, found the weak parts {{of the structure of the}} rim, and this part was consistent with the feedback part, so it proved correct of the finite element analysis model. Clever was used ribbed-plate and punching groove to strengthen the weak part of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> and the finite element model was used to calculate and check the improved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> again. The results showed that the improved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> stress decreased quite, so the measure was correct...|$|R

40|$|A wheel {{assembly}} for an electric vehicle includes a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> that is concentrically disposed about a central axis. A propulsion-braking module is disposed within an interior {{region of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> The propulsion-braking module rotatably supports the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> for rotation about the central axis. The propulsion-braking module includes a liquid cooled electric motor having a rotor rotatable about the central axis, and a stator disposed radially inside the rotor relative to the central axis. A motor-wheel interface hub is fixedly attached to the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> and is directly attached to the rotor for rotation with the rotor. The motor-wheel interface hub directly transmits torque from the electric motor to the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> at a 1 : 1 ratio.

40|$|Beneficial, as-manufactured, {{residual}} {{compressive stresses}} in <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> are introduced during the rim quenching operation. Such compressive stresses {{are known to}} help inhibit the formation of rim fatigue cracks and thus are important to wheel safety. This paper describes measurements of stresses in new <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> at a wrought wheel manufacturing facility, and also use of rim stress measurement for used wheels on the French National Railways (SNCF) and Belgian National Railways (SNCB). Ultrasonic stress measurements made using commercially available Electro-Magnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) and Piezo-Electric Transducer (PET) systems are described. The implications of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> residual stress on wheel service performance {{and the potential for}} use of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> residual stress measurement techniques in North America are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} detect leaks {{on the surface of}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufactured by aluminum die casting and forging. Leaks in the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> may be caused by temperature gradient differences during the cooling period, impurities, or flowing air bubbles in the die casting process. We developed a new low-cost approach to detect leaks that only required a short inspection time by observing the movement of soap bubbles on the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. We designed new light sources to minimize mirror image effects and irregular luminance distributions on the curved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. A preprocessing procedure for image processing was also developed to determine the bubble configurations using threshold and morphology techniques. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the inspection system. The results demonstrated that leaks generated during the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufacturing process could be accurately detected even under various environmental lighting conditions...|$|R

40|$|The <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> {{referred}} to the laboratory had developed a crack at the fillet region of the outer rim flange. The fractographic features were obliterated due to post failure corrosion and hence, the mode of fracture could not be identified unambiguously. However, gross fractographic features and the failure pattern suggest that wheel has failed by fatigue. Microstructural study revealed linear defects entrapped with iron oxide at the fillet of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> These defects were identified to be laps/folds in the material which appeared to have developed during flange rolling operation. It is believed that these defects had acted as stress raisers for premature fatigue crack initiation resulting in failure of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> A detailed analysis is presented in this report...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{essence of}} car <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> {{provides}} a firm base {{on which to}} fit the tire. Its dimensions, shape should be suitable to adequately accommodate the particular tire required for the vehicle. In this project a tire of car <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> belonging to the disc wheel category is considered. Design is an important industrial activity which influences {{the quality of the}} product. The <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> is modeled by using modeling software catiav 5 r 17. By using this software the time spent in producing the complex 3 -D models and the risk involved in the design and manufacturing process can be easily minimized. So the modeling of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> is made by using CATIA. Later this CATIA modal is imported to ANSYS for analysis work. ANSYS is the latest software used for simulating the different forces, pressure acting on the component and also calculating and viewing the results. By using ANSYS software reduces the time compared with the method of mathematical calculations by a human. ANSYS static analysis work is carried out by considered two different materials namely aluminium and forged steel and their relative performances have been observed respectively. In addition to <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> is subjected to modal analysis, a part of dynamic analysis is carried out its performance is observed. In This paper by observing the results of both static and dynamic analysis obtained forged steel is suggested as best material...|$|R

The floor is also slightly bulged due to the past lava uplift, which also likely produced the complex of rilles. The northeast rim is interrupted by the smaller crater Posidonius B.

50|$|Given a set {{of about}} 30 CAD models of car <b>wheel</b> <b>rims,</b> the task {{was to find a}} common {{parametrization}} that is capable of generating each of the individual instances (generative surface reconstruction). As a result, new, similar <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> can be synthesized within the design space that is spanned by the given 30 rims, that were manually classified into 3 main categories. A few of the high-level parameters can be directly manipulated using sliders and buttons (arrows and balls).|$|R
50|$|Air pressure, via the ply cords, exerts {{tensile force}} on the entire bead {{surrounding}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> on which the tire is mounted, pulling outward in a 360 degree pattern. Thus the bead must have high tensile strength. With no force applied to the outer tread, the bead is pulled equally in all directions, thus no additional net {{force is applied to}} the tire bead and <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> However, when the tread is pushed inward on one side, this releases some tension in the corresponding sidewall ply pulling on the bead. Yet the sidewall ply on the other side continues to pull the bead in the opposite direction. Thus the still fully tensioned sidewall ply pulls the tire bead and <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> {{in the same direction as}} the tread displacement with equal force as that applied to push the tread inward.|$|R
