5|$|Juste meets Maxim at {{a castle}} where Lydie {{is being held}} captive; after a brief talk, he leaves Maxim outside and begins to explore the castle. Within the castle, Juste {{encounters}} Death, who confirms that the castle is Dracula's. He then meets up with a dazed Maxim, whose memory is slowly returning to him, and they split up to cover more ground. While trekking through the castle, Juste notices that the castle sometimes has different atmospheres. He continues to encounter Maxim, but is baffled by how his friend seems to change personalities periodically. Regardless, {{in one of their}} meetings, Maxim reveals that he went on a journey to find and destroy the remains of Dracula, something Simon Belmont had previously done, but when he collected all six, his memory <b>went</b> <b>blank.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{were interviewed}} {{for the media}} and by investigators about their experience. One gave the following account of the tragedy: [...] "I was bending down to get some tools when I heard screaming. The ladle was falling... fell on {{to the ground and}} then spilled onto my body and burnt [...] clothes. I just ran." [...] Another gave this description of being burned by the steel: [...] "When the steel hit, it felt like being beaten by iron bars -- my brain <b>went</b> <b>blank.</b> I would be dead if I had turned my head".|$|E
500|$|Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the once-booming music {{industry}} contracted and work became {{more difficult to}} find. For a while, Beiderbecke's only income came from a radio show booked by Whiteman, The Camel Pleasure Hour. However, during a live broadcast on October 8, 1930, Beiderbecke's seemingly limitless gift for improvisation finally failed him: [...] "He stood up to take his solo, but his mind <b>went</b> <b>blank</b> and nothing happened," [...] recalled a fellow musician, Frankie Cush. Whiteman finally let Beiderbecke go. The cornetist {{spent the rest of}} the year at home in Davenport and then, in February 1931, he returned to New York one last time.|$|E

500|$|On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was {{performing}} at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing [...] "Basket Case", {{because he believed}} the group's time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen {{in the rear of}} the audience was labeled [...] "1 Minutes Left", saying [...] "You're not gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a [...] "joke". When the screen <b>went</b> <b>blank,</b> Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that [...] "Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas" [...] also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant.|$|E
500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just <b>went</b> <b>blank</b> and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the next time you see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X ratingâ€”an adults only certificate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Robert Dale Segee of Circleville, Ohio {{claimed he}} was {{responsible}} for setting the circus fire. Segee, a [...] roustabout for the show from June 30 to July 14, 1944, when he was about 14 years old, said he had a nightmare in which an Indian riding on a [...] "flaming horse" [...] told him to set fires. He further claimed that after this nightmare his mind <b>went</b> <b>blank,</b> and that he did not come out of this state until the circus fire had already been set. It was said Segee fit the description of a serial arsonist right out of a psychiatrist's textbook. Segee also knew intimate details of the incident, which some believed only the real arsonist could have known. For instance, it was never made public that the circus had two smaller fires of undetermined origin prior to the tragedy. Segee admitted setting both of them as well. These statements, Segee added, were in response to a later dream he'd had of a woman standing in flames urging him to confess.|$|E
5000|$|Fiver's {{power of}} prescience became more {{prominent}} {{than in the}} book and film; he <b>goes</b> <b>blank</b> with visions, sometimes telepathic, instead of simply delivering omens, and also speaks mostly in rhyme while in this state (though he speaks normally otherwise).|$|R

5000|$|Reviewing {{the album}} at the time, British music weekly NME {{noted that they}} did not have high hopes for <b>Going</b> <b>Blank</b> Again but that Ride [...] "did the business" [...] and {{restored}} the magazines faith in the band, noting particularly that they had taken on board a diverse set of influences and developed their sound: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Going</b> <b>Blank</b> Again is {{the second}} studio album by British rock band Ride, {{released}} on 9 March 1992 on Creation Records.

60|$|Once in his rooms, {{he dropped}} into a Morris chair and sat staring {{straight}} before him. He did not doze. Nor did he think. His mind was a blank, save for the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form and color and radiance just under his eyelids. He saw these pictures, but he was scarcely conscious of them--no more so than {{if they had been}} dreams. Yet he was not asleep. Once, he roused himself and glanced at his watch. It was just eight o'clock. He had nothing to do, and it was too early for bed. Then his mind <b>went</b> <b>blank</b> again, and the pictures began to form and vanish under his eyelids. There was nothing distinctive about the pictures. They were always masses of leaves and shrub-like branches shot through with hot sunshine.|$|E
60|$|After that, for a {{while all}} seemed a dream to Juanna, a dream of which she {{was never able to}} recover any exact memory. She could {{recollect}} standing side by side with Olfan, while Nam muttered prayers and invocations over them, administering to them terrible oaths, which they took, calling upon the names of Aca and of Jal, and swearing by the symbol of the Snake. Beyond that everything <b>went</b> <b>blank.</b> Indeed, her mind flew back to another marriage ceremony, when she stood beside Leonard in the slave camp, and the priest, Francisco, prayed over them and blessed them. It was that scene which she saw, and not the one enacting before her eyes, and with its visions were mixed up strange impersonal reflections on the irony of fate, which had brought it about that she should figure as the chief actor in two such dramas, the first of which Leonard had gone through to save her, and the second of which she must go through to save him.|$|E
60|$|And at luncheon my {{seat was}} next to Miss Thorn's, while the Celebrity was placed {{at the right of}} Miss Trevor. I {{observed}} that his face <b>went</b> <b>blank</b> from time to time at some quip of hers: even a dull woman may be sharp under such circumstances, and Miss Trevor had wits to spare. And I marked that she never allowed her talk with him to drift into deep water; when there was danger of this she would draw the entire table into their conversation by some adroit remark, or create a laugh at his expense. As for me, I held a discreet if uncomfortable silence, save for the few words which passed between Miss Thorn and me. Once or twice I caught her covert glance on me. But I felt, and strongly, that there could be no friendship between us now, and I did not care to dissimulate merely for the sake of appearances. Besides, I was not a little put out over the senseless piece of gossip which had gone abroad concerning me.|$|E

"Whereas the Teletubbies have presumably {{only just}} started to acquire the {{apparatus}} of human articulation ("Eh-oh!") and are trapped in their progress for hundreds of episodes by the requirements of serialization, Beckettâ€™s hooded figures totally relinquish expressiveness beyond their coloured gowns, leitmotiv percussion, and racecourse.
