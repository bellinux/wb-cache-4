25|$|Rantel is a {{political}} conservative and is {{a supporter of the}} policies and presidency of Ronald Reagan.

Governor Cruz Bustamante and Madeleine Albright. Primarily in regard to differences <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration over illegal immigration issues, Rantel was noticeably at odds with specific policies of George W. Bush and Republican members of Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the life}} of the Viscount {{aircraft}} type, renewal of the inner lower booms included installation of new mount fittings for attachment of the rear of the two inboard engine nacelles to the lower booms. [...] New fittings were supplied without pre-drilled holes and the holes were drilled during installation to correctly align <b>the</b> engine nacelle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wing. However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle rear mount fittings. Re-use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> in <b>the</b> new inner lower booms. [...] When new inner lower booms were installed in VH-RMQ in 1958, new engine nacelle rear mount fittings were also installed but when new booms were again installed in 1964 the fittings first installed in 1958 were re-used. [...] In the wreckage of the right wing of VH-RMQ there was evidence of an initial problem while trying to align the five holes in <b>the</b> old fitting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> in <b>the</b> new boom. The bores of three bushes had been scored with a drill, possibly while maintenance personnel were trying to align three of the holes sufficiently to be able to insert the attachment bolts. Running a drill through <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> at Station 143 may have disturbed <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> and initiated a sequence of actions leading to fatal damage to the wall of the hole.|$|R

Along with making an urgent request for {{a meeting of the}} National Security Council's Principals Committee to discuss the growing al-Qaeda threat in the greater Middle East, the memo also suggests strategies for combating al-Qaeda that might be adopted by the new Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|The opening {{match of}} the 1903 season saw Cities defeat Stars 7-1 at the 'Pineapple-paddock'.

25|$|Gay {{rights advocates}} criticized her for waiting {{until after the}} 2004 {{election}} to voice her disapproval of the Bush administration's positions on gay rights.

He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked whether she had any input <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her job to do so.|$|E
