500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
500|$|The Oklahoman gave Spit a {{positive}} review: [...] "Throw {{in the fact}} that they range in age from 15 to 18, and Kittie seems like the perfect weapon to smite Mandy Moore, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera, forever ridding the music industry of teen-pop". The CMJ New Music Report gave Spit {{a positive}} review: [...] "the teenage babes in Ontario, Canada's Kittie will scratch and claw their way into the dark recesses of your hearts thanks to their debut, the smashing 'n' stomping Spit". The Washington Post criticized the album: [...] "All four members of this Canadian metal-punk band are women, which is still a novel (though certainly not unique) lineup for a headbanging ensemble. Too bad that's virtually the quartet's only distinguishing feature". The review concluded, [...] "After four or five of these pounding rockers, Kittie becomes a bore." [...] Exclaim! also criticized the album: [...] "Guidance Counsellor's advice: pull the plug and stay in school". NME gave the album a four-out-of-ten rating: [...] "Like kindred spirits System of a Down, Kittie <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the impression that they're just too tasty to fuk wit, too unhinged to view as normal folk, too pierced for the mainstream." [...] Spit was number 24 on Metal Descent's [...] "25 Best Alternative Metal Albums" [...] list, and [...] "Brackish" [...] was on Fuse's [...] "19 Best Nu-Metal Hits of All Time" [...] list.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a B-side to [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give</b> <b>You</b> My Everything" [...] (written by Brooklyn songwriter Larry Weiss and sung by Carl Douglas). The producer Biddu originally hired Douglas to sing [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give</b> <b>You</b> My Everything" [...] but needed something to record for the B-side, and asked Douglas if he had any lyrics they could use. Douglas showed several, out of which Biddu chose the one that would later be called [...] "Kung Fu Fighting" [...] and worked out a melody for it without taking it too seriously.|$|E

2500|$|Episode one of {{the series}} was {{released}} on October 3, 2014, with additional episodes released weekly online. Glass introduced it as a spinoff of his popular radio program, This American Life, and aired episode one on his show. He explained, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the same experience you get from a great HBO or Netflix series, where you get {{caught up with the}} characters and the thing unfolds week after week, but with a true story, and no pictures. Like House of Cards, but you can enjoy it while you're driving." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{the lowdown}} on the SW re-formation but there's {{honestly}} {{not a lot}} to say. Legal issues prevented me from doing my own band on my own terms {{over the past couple}} of years but thankfully those problems are all resolved now. The kind of stuff happens sometimes. I won't deny that those problems - which were really just the culmination of many years of a lot of other b.s. - left a foul taste in my mouth about SW. But now that all the headaches are behind me I'm feeling great about it. I'm finally running my own band again and I'm really happy and excited to be back at it. I've got a killer line-up [...] myself, Danny Vapid, Simon Lamb (the Ritalins), Justin Perkins (Yesterday's Kids) and Adam Cargin (Blueheels) (he's also the new Riverdales drummer) and we've got a great set list." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gan Ning {{was unhappy}} with Huang Zu and wanted to leave him, but was worried that Huang would not allow it, so he felt very frustrated. Su Fei was aware of Gan Ning's intention, so he invited him for drinks and said, [...] "I {{recommended}} you to Huang Zu many times, but he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> important responsibilities. Days pass by and people become older. You should make {{plans for the future}} and find someone who truly appreciates your talents." [...] Gan Ning paused for a moment before replying, [...] "That's what I've in mind, but I can't find an excuse to leave." [...] Su Fei then said, [...] "I'll suggest to Huang Zu to appoint you as the Chief (長) of Zhu County (邾縣; northwest of present-day Huanggang, Hubei). The initial phase is difficult, but after you reach it, it'll be much easier for you to decide where to go from there." [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Great." [...] Huang Zu approved Su Fei's suggestion. Gan Ning managed to gather a few hundred men who were willing to follow him, and they headed towards Zhu.|$|E

2500|$|Creators of Gorillaz, {{musician}} Damon Albarn {{and artist}} Jamie Hewlett, {{began working on}} a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called Carousel, which evolved into Plastic Beach, the group's third studio album. In the November 2007 issue of Q, when asked what his top priority for 2008 was, Damon Albarn replied [...] "Well, I'm doing the next Gorillaz thing, but it won't be called Gorillaz." [...] In the February 2008 Gorillaz-Unofficial interview, Jamie Hewlett elaborated on this, saying [...] "I think the idea behind it is that it's like how The Who presented their movies– Tommy and Quadrophenia and so on. Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though none {{of the members of the}} band were in the movies. I don't think anyone from The Who was in Quadrophenia. But it's the same people working on it, that's the principle." [...] In a July 2008 interview with The Observer he also said, [...] "Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more— it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects. [...] That's my ideal model— Gorillaz is a group of people who gave you this, and now <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> new stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} Amelius {{appeared}} in the hall, and answered the question himself. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a word of warning," [...] he said.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{legal rights}} <b>to</b> all he has, and you've {{got to do}} it quick. No tellin' what may happen." [...] His voice choked as he said this.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet I was {{thinking}} of that only," [...] interrupted Almayer, [...] "and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> years of happiness for the short day of your suffering. I only knew of one way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} to-night, Bert. But I'm thankful to you, just the same. After the concert we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a ride around the lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|Doctor Harris stood up. [...] "Westerburg, {{when you}} come inside, will you stop off at my office? I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a few tests, if you don't mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's easily answered," [...] said Mr. Watkins. [...] "I {{understand}} you haven't {{seen one of}} them yet, and they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an opportunity of doing so." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this moment}} the door opened, {{and there was}} a sound of {{chirping}} voices in the hall. [...] "Please, Miss Florence," [...] said Betty, [...] "the little folks says they <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a Christmas." [...] She added in a whisper: [...] "They thinks much of <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> something, poor little things--plaze take it of 'em." [...] And little Tottie at the word marched in and offered the young princess his dear, beautiful, beloved string of glass beads, and Elsie presented the cross of red berries--most dear to her heart and fair to her eyes. [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> something" [...] she said bashfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am getting}} an old woman. We {{must take the}} more cheerful view of things. I came to you at once, because I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> as much notice as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I kep' it close, 'cos I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an' my mates a {{surprise}}, but {{it strikes}} me I'll give some other people a surprise to-day, for there's no time to put on clean toggery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did," [...] Mr. Kauffman answered. [...] "It is {{for that}} reason that I hurried here. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> good advice. I want you not to lose your money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> fair {{warning that}} neither I nor Carl will {{stand for the}} way you are acting. Either you keep your distance, or it will be the worse for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} to sell," [...] she retorted impatiently, summoning her wits {{to meet the}} occasion. [...] "Let me in, please. Or do you transact all your business in the hallway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I—I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a surprise—a {{pleasant}} little surprise," [...] said Mr. Chalk, with a timid {{glance at}} Captain Bowers. [...] "I have bought {{a share in}} a schooner, {{to go for a}} little cruise. Just a jaunt for pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "it's no good {{thinking}} about that, is it? I've <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> this for ages, darling; it IS so uncomfortable on my finger. Now, {{just let me}} see if I can pop it on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, old fellow, we all <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> kind of pay {{for what}} happened awhile ago, and to show how much we liked you {{for being such a}} trump. Please take it, and have a jolly good time with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gaites {{nodded in}} proud assent, and Birkwall went on: [...] "I {{thought you were}} faking the name last night; but I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> away. It was the real thing, wasn't it, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] said she, after pausing a little, as if {{she wanted}} to be sure and get it right, [...] "you two saved my life, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} to remember me by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, mother," [...] {{said the}} puzzled Wizard, [...] "we're not known. We're strangers. I'd look fine {{going up there}} to the college and saying, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> people a million dollars.' They'd laugh at me!" ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{said that}} Anne met the poet soon after the song was {{published}} in 1782 and said to him {{that she had not}} expected to be celebrated in print, to which he replied [...] "Oh ay, I was just <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a cast among the lave!" ...|$|R
6000|$|...
