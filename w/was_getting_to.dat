5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E

As a Modern Languages student, she was required to spend her third year abroad, and studied in Paris. She then decided to quit university to concentrate on her burgeoning acting career: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the point where I wasn't enjoying either thing enough because both were very high pressure." ...|$|E

500|$|In late February {{and early}} March 2007, the band headlined a North American {{with support from}} Underoath and Armor for Sleep. On April 2, [...] "My Blue Heaven" [...] was {{released}} as a single and released to radio a week later. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour with Linkin Park. On August 3 {{it was announced that}} O'Connell had injured his back, and he was replaced by Matchbook Romance drummer Aaron Stern {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Shortly after the tour Mascherino left the band, although his departure was not announced until early October. He said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the point where I felt I had taken the road as long as I possibly could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go." [...] Mascherino had written over 45 songs, most intended for Louder Now but turned down by the band. He began a solo project, the Color Fred.|$|E

He said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the point where I felt I had taken the road as long as I possibly could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go". In October, the group revealed that their next album was [...] "in its very early stages". In December, Rubano said the group was in New York City working on new material, having already written six songs. Prior to demoing, O'Connell had to have back surgery, having injured it during the Projekt Revolution tour. During the demoing process, the group tried different drummers, but according to Rubano: [...] "They just weren't Mark. Not enough ferocity, intensity." [...] Following this, the band's members took time to refocus themselves after several years of constant touring. Lazzara sorted his life out following addiction issues, ending his engagement to Chauntelle DuPree of Eisley. He subsequently moved to another town, got married, and had a child. O'Connell also got married, Reyes spent time with his family, and Rubano recorded music for the TV show Electric Company.|$|E
500|$|Welles said, [...] "the {{film was}} not {{intended}} as a lament for Falstaff, but {{for the death of}} Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed." [...] Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the [...] "Lost Eden" [...] in Welles's work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called [...] "the central theme in Western culture." [...] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that [...] "even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit." [...] Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles's depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a [...] "ower baby...an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature." [...] Welles also called Falstaff [...] "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama", and said that [...] "the closer I thought I <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, one of {{the most}} {{controversial}} moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs, the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the New York Knicks, whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2–0 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach Phil Jackson needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie Toni Kukoč, with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Although Kukoč did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court. [...] "Scottie asked out of the play," [...] Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview. Teammate Steve Kerr elaborated when asked to recall the event: [...] "I don't know what got into Pippen. He is such a great teammate and maybe the pressure <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> him and he just could not take it anymore, no one knows for sure but he is a team player." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1985 {{was to see}} Keke Rosberg set {{the all-time}} Formula 1 {{qualifying}} lap record for 17 years after posting fastest qualifying time for the race with an average speed of 258.983km/h (160.92mph). Silverstone, which was already a very fast circuit, was becoming faster and faster and the cars were lapping the circuit in the low 1-minute range. The race was an exciting one with Brazilian rising star Ayrton Senna making a great start from 4th and taking the lead by the first corner. He led {{until late in the}} race, when his car was running out of fuel while Prost was pushing him hard; Senna eventually ran out of fuel and Prost went on to take victory. 1986 saw a huge crowd thanks to Mansell being a favourite to win; his newly found fame and place in a competitive team would help the British Grand Prix to see huge crowds for several years. This race saw 42-year-old Jacques Laffite get involved in a first corner accident and slam head-on into the barriers, breaking both his legs and ending his Formula One career. Nigel Mansell, whose car broke {{at the start of the}} first race, got into his teammate Piquet's spare car and won the race; although this was the last F1 race at Brands Hatch. A number of people had concerns about the speeds of the cars on the small track; particularly the European Grand Prix held at Brands Hatch the previous year. The southern English circuit <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> be very fast- now with these 1,000+ hp, 1,180 pound cars, pole sitter Piquet's average qualifying speed was 140.483mph (227.583km/h) and his lap time was in the 1 minute 6-second range, compared to the 1 minute 20-second range in 1976. But Brands Hatch's demise was for political reasons- the international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts for one circuit per Grand Prix. Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility, and considering most of the track was located in a very old forest it did have very little run-off and room to expand, something Silverstone had in acres. Silverstone and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA at some point in 1986, to run from 1987 to 1993.|$|E
