40|$|<b>White</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozetti) (He- miptera: Diaspididae) is {{a serious}} {{economic}} and quarantine pest of papaya, Carica papaya L. The parasitic wasp Encarsia diaspidicola (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was brought from Western Samoa into a quarantine containment facility in Hawaii for evaluation and potential release against <b>white</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale.</b> E. diaspidicola was considered an ideal biological control candidate for release in Hawaii because it is reportedly highly host specific. Host range testing in quarantine with several exotic diaspidids and related taxa, including a native palm scale, indicated that E. dispidicola is unlikely to attack non-target species or cause {{harm to the environment}} if released for control of <b>white</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> in Hawaii. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture and USDA APHIS issued permits for its release. Releases of E. diaspidicola were made beginning in February 2013 in a papaya field in Kapoho on the Big Island. Yellow sticky trap monitoring suggests that the wasp has established in the area of release. Infested papaya logs are being used to spread the wasp to new areas...|$|E
40|$|The distribution, host plants, {{and natural}} {{enemies of the}} <b>white</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozzetti) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), were {{investigated}} in 25 districts of Ankara Province, Turkey, during 2013 - 2015. Thirteen districts were infested with harmful white peach scale; infestation was most common in parks, roadsides, private and institution gardens in centrum and old silkroad parts of Ankara. Twenty-two host plant species were found in these 13 districts, five of which (Aesculus carnea, Hibiscus sp., Paulownia tomentosa, Rhus thyphina and Salix babylonica) had not previously been recorded as host plants in Turkey. Some host plant species, including Catalpa bignonioides, Cornus alba, Fraxinus americana, F. excelsior, Forsythia intermedia, Morus alba, M. nigra and Sophora japonica, {{were found to be}} very highly infested. Five species of predators and three species of parasitoids were associated with <b>white</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale.</b> Orius minutus L., Chrysoperla pallida (Henry et al.) are new record as predator of P. pentagona in World and Epitetracnemus comis Noyes &Ren Hui are first time record in Turkey...|$|E

40|$|The <b>white</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni Tozzetti) (PP) is {{considered}} a main pest of peach orchards in the East Mediterranean region of Turkey. Peach is grown traditionally in the mountain area, {{but in the last}} two decades the number of peach orchards increased significantly in the coastal plains of the East Mediterranean region. PP is distributed in all peach-growing localities and heavy infestation occurs in orchards of the coastal plain. During this study two parasitoids — Encarsia berlesei (Howard) and Azotus perspeciosus (Girault) — and four predators — Cybocephalus fodori minor (Endrody-Younga), Chilocorus bipustulatus (L.), Rhyzobius lophanthae (Blaisdell) and Pharoscymnus pharoides Marseul — were found. The <b>white</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> occurs in Turkey on 14 host plants including several fruit trees, ornamental plants and some herbaceous plants under the canopy of heavily infested peach trees. Population fluctuations from November 1991 through November 1993 were observed at four locations representing two different ecological conditions. In the mountain area two distinct generations were recorded, the first in June/July and the second in September/October. In the coastal plain three generations were observed, the first in mid-April, the second in June/July and the third in October/November. PP population peaks are not followed by the parasitoid and predator populations, suggesting that the effectiveness of these natural enemies is not sufficient to control the pest...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>white</b> <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> (WPS), Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozzetti) (Homoptera: Diaspididae), is a {{world wide}} {{polyphagous}} scale insect. It is widely distributed in north of Iran, near the Caspian Sea areas, where it is the main pest of mulberry and kiwi trees. The development and fecundity of P. pentagona were examined at different temperatures and on different hosts in the laboratory. The longevity of WPS decreased with a rise in temperature. At 25 °C {{the largest number of}} crawlers (76. 1 crawlers/female) was observed. The development time of WPS was generally longer on kiwi than mulberry or potato; fecundity was higher on potato than on other hosts, potato tubers and kiwi trees...|$|E

Italian <b>white</b> <b>peaches</b> were one of Cipriani’s favorite fruits, but were only available from June to September. In a moment of inspiration he created this refreshing summer beverage by combining the fresh <b>white</b> <b>peaches</b> with prosecco. He named his cocktail after Giovanni Bellini, a famous Italian painter from the late 15th century.|$|R

In this study, we tried answer {{on the question}} raised whether synthetic commercial pheromones of WSP or SJS could work as a kairomonal stimulant and positively attract higher numbers of the specialized parasitoids. Although pheromone traps attracted {{a wide range of}} parasitoid species, most of them were accidentally. However, the parasitoid Thomsonisca amathus (Walker) (Hymenoptera: E ncyrtidae) and the parasitoid Encarsia perniciosi (Tower) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) significantly respond to the sex pheromones of WPS and SJS, respectively, suggesting that they may {{play an important role in}} host location...|$|E

40|$|The parents' {{evaluation}} of aural/oral performance of children (<b>PEACH)</b> <b>scale</b> {{was developed to}} assess the effectiveness of amplification for children, based on a systematic use of parents' observations of children's performance in real-world environments. Objective: The {{purpose of the present}} study was to adapt the <b>PEACH</b> <b>scale</b> into the Malay language, and to collect normative data on a group of children with normal hearing. Study sample: The participants were parents of 74 children aged between 3 months and 13 years of age. Parents were requested to observe their children's auditory/oral behavior in everyday life and to record their observations in the PEACH booklet. Results: High internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 93) and item-total correlation were found (0. 520. 85). Similar to the published norms for English-speaking children, near-perfect scores were achieved by Malaysian children around 40 months of age. Conclusions: The adapted version can be used to evaluate amplification for children in the Malay speaking environment. The normative curve relating age to scores for the Malay PEACH can be used as a reference against whic h functional aural/oral performance of hearing-impaired Malaysian children can be evaluated. 8 page(s...|$|R
