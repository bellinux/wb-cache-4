40|$|During {{the three-day}} period 17 - 19 March 2003, 130 mm {{of rain and}} liquid {{equivalent}} snow were recorded at the Marshall Field Site located south of Boulder. CO and operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Five heated Geonor T- 200 B 3 -wire gauges continuously recorded 1 -minute accumulations of precipitation, each gauge in a different windshield. The five windshields were the WMO Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR), a two-thirds size DFIR, two double-Alter shields, and a traditional single Alter shield. The event {{can be characterized as}} a 16 -hour period of discontinuous rain followed by a 37 -hour period of continuous snowfall with wind speed between 0 and 11 ms- 1 and air temperature during snowfall between- 1. 0 °C and 0. 5 °C. The results show that the two highest storm total accumulations were from the DFIR and 2 / 3 size DFIR with the least storm total from the single Alter at 65 % of the DFIR. The cause of the undercatch is the design of the windshield. A plot of the decreasing ratio of 15 -minute accumulations from the gauge in the single Alter shield to those from the gauge in the DFIR with increasing wind speed is shown. All gauges were heated with a fine <b>wire</b> <b>tape</b> so that the temperature of the gauge orifice usually varied between 0 °C and 2 °C. During periods of high snowfall rate, the duty cycle of heating influences the 1 -minute precipitation rates in a predictable way. Also of interest is the observation of "snow dumps " that occur when an accumulation of snow adhering to the rim of the gauge orifice detaches and falls into the bucket. This precipitation event demonstrates the sensitivity of estimating liquid equivalent snowfall to the type of windshield employed and the comparative insensitivity when only rain is occurring...|$|E

Silver {{was used as}} a chemical addition as well as a sheath material. Transport measurements were performed by a standard four-probe resistive method. All the <b>wire</b> and <b>tape</b> samples have shown transport properties. Critical current density Jc was enhanced upon silver addition, and at 4. 2 K, a best Jc of ~ 1200 A/cm^ 2 (Ic = 9 A) was achieved for 20 % silver added tapes, which is the highest in iron-based <b>wires</b> and <b>tapes</b> so far. The Jc is almost field independent between 1 T and 10 T, exhibiting a strong vortex pinning. Such a high transport critical current density is attributed to the absence of reaction layer between the silver sheath and superconducting core, as well as an improved connectivity between grains. We also identify a weak-link behavior from the creep drop of Jc at low fields and a hysteretic phenomenon.
