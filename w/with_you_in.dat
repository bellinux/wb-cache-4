In January 2007, Mike and Jane Tomlinson launched Jane Tomlinson's Run For All, a 10km charity run {{that took place}} in June that year. Having had four courses of chemotherapy, she developed chronic heart disease. Having been elevated to a CBE in June 2007, Jane Tomlinson died in St Gemma's Hospice, Leeds, West Yorkshire less than three months later on 3 September. Her Requiem Mass, which was conducted by Arthur Roche, Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds, was held at the Roman Catholic Leeds Cathedral on 14 September 2007.

25|$|In January 2007, the European {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} motion decreeing that all international trains must carry bicycles. In some cities, bicycles {{may also be}} carried on local trains, trams and buses {{so that they may}} be used {{at either end of the}} trip. The Rheinbahn transit company in Düsseldorf permits bicycle carriage on all its bus, tram and train services at any time of the day,. In Munich bicycles are allowed on the S-Bahn commuter trains outside of rush hours, and folding bikes are allowed on city busses. In Copenhagen, you can take your bicycle <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the S-tog commuter trains, all times a day with no additional costs. In France, the prestigious TGV high-speed trains are even having some of their first class capacity converted to store bicycles. There have also been schemes, such as in Victoria, British Columbia, Acadia, and Canberra, Australia to provide bicycle carriage on buses using externally mounted bike carriers.|$|E

25|$|After a {{successful}} worldwide tour {{in support of}} Mother's Milk the band released their debut for Warners, 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik which was hugely successful upon its release peaking at number three on the Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. It went on to be nominated and win several awards and is listed on many critics lists of the best albums of the year. Shortly into the tour for the album, Frusciante quit the band in 1992 and was replaced by Arik Marshall {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Marshall was fired following the tour and briefly replaced by Jesse Tobias who was let go in favor of Dave Navarro in 1994. With Navarro intact, the band would release 1995's One Hot Minute. Navarro too would end up being fired in 1998 following the tour to support the album and replaced with a returning John Frusciante. With Frusciante back, the band released 1999's Californication, their biggest selling album to date. That album was followed by 2002's By the Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium, the band's first number one album in the United States. Frusciante again quit the band in 2008 and was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer in 2009. With Klinghoffer, the band released their tenth studio album (and Smith's seventh with the band), I'm <b>with</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> 2011.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Marriott had several guest {{performances}} on television shows including The Defenders, Route 66, and The Patty Duke Show. In 1963 he {{was cast in}} a primary role in Robert Thom's Bicycle Ride to Nevada, which opened the season at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in September, prior to premiering on Broadway at the Cort Theatre on September 24. The play was not well received by the critics, and closed after a single performance. His next project was {{a prominent role in}} The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, which opened on November 11, 1963 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, after a week of previews. While this Broadway premiere was not a commercial success, the Bertolt Brecht play is considered a classical theater satire. Marriott's film contribution in 1963 fared better, as he played the role of Hurst in the critically acclaimed, The Cool World. During the decade he would continue to perform in regional theater, such as You Can't Take It <b>with</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> 1966 at the Corning Summer Theatre. The following year he appeared in Eugene O'Neill's More Stately Mansions, which opened at the Broadhurst Theatre on Halloween (October 31) 1967, and ran for 142 performances. The play starred Ingrid Bergman, Colleen Dewhurst, and Arthur Hill. After Mansions closed on March 2, 1968, Marriott appeared in the very next production at the Broadhurst, as Roger in the Gore Vidal political comedy, Weekend, which opened on March 13. The play was not well received and closed after only 21 performances.|$|E

It's hard to explain the special appeal of this episode. Perhaps it's because Homer is so exceptionally dumb. Or perhaps because it contains the 'D'oh!' 'A deer!' 'A female deer!' gag." [...] This gag was also praised by BBC News's Mark Milne, who said: [...] " [...] just cracks me up every time. Brilliant!" [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the fifth season included [...] "plenty of programs with potentially cheesy concepts", such as [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] and [...] "Bart Gets an Elephant". However, he thought the episode managed to [...] "easily overcome its possible flaws" [...] {{to turn into a}} [...] "very fine program". Homer's line [...] "Marge, I agree <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> theory. In theory, communism works [...] In theory" [...] was Jacobson's favorite of the episode.
