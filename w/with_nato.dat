5|$|Ukraine's {{present and}} future {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> has been politically divisive, and {{is part of a}} larger debate between Ukraine's political and cultural ties to both the European Union and Russia. It established ties to the alliance with a NATO–Ukraine Action Plan on 22 November 2002, and became the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to join NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative in February 2005. Then in April 2005, Ukraine entered into the Intensified Dialogue programme <b>with</b> <b>NATO.</b>|$|E
5|$|Georgia {{moved quickly}} {{following}} the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties <b>with</b> <b>NATO.</b> Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit where NATO members promised that Georgia would eventually join the organization.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1962, President Kennedy {{ordered a}} naval {{quarantine}} of Cuba {{in response to}} the presence of Soviet missiles on the soil of that island nation. Yancey sortied in support of the American operations in the Caribbean, and remained on station until the missiles were removed and tensions were relaxed. Over the next few years, Yancey made regular deployments to the Mediterranean to take part in joint exercises <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> forces.|$|E

This aircraft also had a reconnaissance role.|$|R
5|$|The Thunderjet {{became the}} USAF's primary strike {{aircraft}} during the Korean War, flying 86,408 sorties and destroying 60% of all ground {{targets in the}} war as well as eight Soviet-built MiG fighters. Over half of the 7,524 F-84s produced served <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> nations, {{and it was the}} first aircraft to fly with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team. The USAF Strategic Air Command had F-84 Thunderjets in service from 1948 through 1957.|$|E
5|$|Belarus has not {{expressed}} a desire to join NATO but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997, and Belarus provides refueling and airspace support for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. Belarus first began to cooperate <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> upon signing documents to participate in their Partnership for Peace Program in 1995. However, Belarus cannot join NATO because it {{is a member of the}} Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Tensions between NATO and Belarus peaked after the March 2006 presidential election in Belarus.|$|E
5|$|Bosnia and Herzegovina began further {{cooperation}} <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> {{within their}} Individual Partnership Action Plan in January 2008. The country then started {{the process of}} Intensified Dialogue at the 2008 Bucharest summit. The country was {{invited to join the}} Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants in September 2008. On 2 October 2009, Haris Silajdžić, the Bosniak Member of the Presidency, announced official application for Membership Action Plan. On 22 April 2010, NATO agreed to launch the Membership Action Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but with certain conditions attached. Turkey is thought to be the biggest supporter of Bosnian membership, and heavily influenced the decision.|$|E

A new control tower and a passenger terminal and operations bunker completed the update.|$|R
5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E
5|$|In late 2014, the USAF {{was testing}} a rapid {{deployment}} concept involving four F-22s and one C-17 for support, first proposed in 2008 by two F-22 pilots. The goal {{was for the}} type {{to be able to}} set up and engage in combat within 24 hours. Four F-22s were deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany in August and Lask Air Base in Poland and Amari Air Base in Estonia in September 2015 to train <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> allies.|$|E
5|$|The Bonn–Paris {{conventions}} {{ended the}} allies occupation of West Germany, and were ratified {{in part on}} the basis that West Germany join NATO, which it did in 1955. Though initially isolationist, Spain under Francisco Franco was heavily anti-Communist, and bound by regular defence agreements <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> countries. After its transition to democracy, Spain came under pressure to normalize its European relations, including joining NATO, which it did in 1982. A referendum in 1986 confirmed popular support for this.|$|E

50|$|Since health matters within NATO were {{historically}} regarded strictly as {{a national}} responsibility, the alliance {{did not have a}} high-level collective medical authority for the first few decades of its existence. <b>With</b> <b>NATO's</b> increasing emphasis on joint operations came the need for coordinating medical support in peacekeeping, disaster-relief, and humanitarian operations.|$|R
5|$|The Romanian {{military}} {{is undergoing a}} three-stage restructuring. As of 2007, the first short-term stage was completed (reorganisation of the command system, implementation of the voluntary military service). The year 2015 {{marks the end of}} the second stage (operational integration in NATO and EU), while 2025 is the date when the long-term stage is to be completed (full technical integration in NATO and EU). The stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces, reducing the personnel as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> standards.|$|E
5|$|The four NATO {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} during Operation Deny Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. Deny Flight also demonstrated {{the necessity of}} better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to some calls for technical training of UN personnel to work <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> military systems. Finally, {{the rules of engagement}} established under Deny Flight also {{played an important role in}} shaping the rules of engagement for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|This article poses {{two general}} limits to {{non-member}} states. First, only European states {{are eligible for}} new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward {{that have to be}} attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO, due to the disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the Republic of Cyprus <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.|$|E

5|$|When the Czech Republic {{became a}} NATO member in 1999, {{the need to}} replace their {{existing}} Soviet-built MiG-21 fleet with aircraft compatible <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> interoperability standards became apparent. In 2000, the Czech Republic began evaluating a number of aircraft, including the F-16, F/A-18, Mirage 2000, Eurofighter Typhoon and the Gripen. One major procurement condition was the industrial offset agreement, set at 150% of the expected purchase value. In December 2001, having reportedly been swayed by Gripen International's generous financing and offset programme, the Czech Government announced that the Gripen had been selected. In 2002, the deal was delayed until after parliamentary elections had taken place; alternative means of air defense were also studied, including leasing the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Austria and Switzerland {{are both}} {{members of the}} Partnership for Peace, and border NATO member states. Malta {{is also a member}} of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union. However, each country has a long-standing policy of neutrality. Cyprus is the only Member state of the European Union that is not a member of the Partnership for Peace, with any treaty blocked by Turkey's {{concerns}} regarding the Cyprus dispute. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal {{has been}} the highest rank in the British Army since 1736. A five-star rank <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> code OF-10, it is {{equivalent}} to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force (RAF). A Field Marshal's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward's Crown. Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life, though on half-pay when not in an appointment. The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries (when all former holders of the rank were deceased). After the Second World War, it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (later renamed Chief of the General Staff) to the rank on his last day in the post. Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of all the British Armed Forces, were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment.|$|E
50|$|Turkey has {{usually been}} {{regarded}} {{to be at}} odds <b>with</b> <b>NATO's</b> policy on ISIL, having been criticised {{by many of the}} organisation's members for not doing more to tackle ISIL. However, NATO has responded to Turkish requests to maintain security on the Turkish-Syrian border, deploying MIM-104 Patriot missiles on the border in 2013.|$|R

5|$|In February 1991, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia) {{formed the}} Visegrád Group {{to push for}} European {{integration}} under the European Union and NATO, {{as well as to}} conduct military reforms in line <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> standards. Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and that NATO should be a partner in these efforts. In subsequent years, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its eastern neighbors were set up, including the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (later the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council) and the Partnership for Peace.|$|E
5|$|In peacetime, the {{commander}} of the land forces is the minister of defense, while in wartime, the President of Romania becomes the supreme commander of the armed forces. The main combat formations of Romania are the 2nd Infantry Division Getica, and the 4th Infantry Division Gemina. Until 2015 the Romanian land forces fielded a third division, namely the 1st Division Dacia. Before June 2008, the 1st and 4th divisions were known as the 1st Territorial Army Corps and the 4th Territorial Army Corps and in turn they used to be called the 1st Army and 4th Army prior to 2000. However due to their personnel having been reduced considerably in order to reach compatibility <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> standards they were renamed and reorganized as divisions. In 2010, the Joint HQ command was renamed as 2nd Infantry Division Getica and received units from the 1st and the 4th Infantry divisions.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>NATO</b> coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage {{of time spent in}} critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E
