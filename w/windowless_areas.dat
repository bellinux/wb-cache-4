40|$|Tubular light guides are {{applicable}} for daylighting of <b>windowless</b> <b>areas</b> in buildings. Despite their many positive indoor climate aspects {{they can also}} present some problems with heat losses and condensation. A computer CFD model focused on the evaluation of temperature distribution and air flow inside tubular light guides of different dimensions was studied. The physical model of the tested light guides of lengths more than 0. 60 m proves shows that Rayleigh numbers are adequate for a turbulent air flow. The turbulent model was applied despite the small heat flux differences between the turbulent and laminar model. The CFD simulations resulted into conclusions that the growing ratio of length/diameter increases the heat transmission loss/linear transmittance as much as by 50 percent. Tubular light guides of smaller diameters have lower heat transmission losses compared to the wider ones of the same lengths with the same outdoor temperature being taken into account. The simulation results confirmed the thermal bridge effect of the tubular light guide tube inside the insulated flat roof details. The thermal transmittance of the studied light guides in the whole roof area was substituted with the point thermal bridges. This substitution gives possibility for simple thermal evaluation of the tubular light pipes in roof constructions...|$|E
500|$|Living {{space on}} the ship was {{allocated}} {{on the basis of}} rank. Bligh, having yielded the great cabin, occupied private sleeping quarters with an adjacent dining area or pantry on the starboard side of the ship, and Fryer a small cabin on the opposite side. The surgeon Thomas Huggan, the other warrant officers, and Nelson the botanist had tiny cabins on the lower deck, while the master's mates and the midshipmen, together with the young gentlemen, berthed together in an area behind the captain's dining room known as the cockpit; as junior or prospective officers, they were allowed use of the quarterdeck. The other ranks had their quarters in the forecastle, a <b>windowless</b> unventilated <b>area</b> measuring [...] with headroom of [...]|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe SPIRAL 2 {{installation}} {{is being}} built in order to study rare elements through the production of radioactive isotopes. Its injector, a superconducting linear accelerator (LINAC) {{is designed to provide}} very high intensity (up to ~ 1014 particles/s) beams of deuterons and stable ions between carbon and uranium. The “Super Separator Spectrometer” (S 3) was designed to separate and mass-analyse recoils from the various induced fusion-evaporation reactions in order to enable nuclear structure studies of proton-rich rare isotopes around 100 Sn and in the region of the Super Heavy Elements. A new optimized focal plan detection system called SIRIUS for “Spectroscopy and Identification of Rare Isotopes Using S 3 ” is developed to within the SIRIUS collaboration. The new generation <b>windowless</b> large <b>area</b> silicon-box developed in this framework is discussed in this article. We present the simulations done {{in order to determine the}} best geometry and layout for this large area silicon detector assembly...|$|R
