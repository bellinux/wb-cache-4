500|$|Following the Master of Reality {{world tour}} in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: [...] "The band started to become very {{fatigued}} and very tired. We'd {{been on the}} road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff". He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand-off, explaining that [...] "instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I tilt up, and now I'm shooting up his nose almost, and it <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> very disorienting. The show's got a certain ennui that appeals to me, the film noir-y movies of the '40s look, an undercurrent of tension and anxiety 'cause of all the weird things going on".|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{made two}} {{important}} career moves in August 1962: he legally {{changed his name}} to Robert Dylan, and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman. (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.) Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty. Dylan said, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a Colonel Tom Parker figure... you could smell him coming." [...] Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond's being replaced as producer of Dylan's second album by the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson.|$|E

500|$|According to Monaghan, Drive Shaft {{is similar}} to Oasis, in that [...] " [...] first album <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> Oasis's first album: {{critically}} acclaimed, didn't sell big numbers, but in the industry, people gave it respect." [...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that {{if he wanted to}} write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes." [...] The producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other. According to Burk, [...] "At one point, in a delirious stupor, we realized we had said it so many times that that had to be the song." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Made It" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Tye Tribbett and David Outing. Prior to its release on her album The Definition Of... (2016), Fantasia {{had played a}} portion of the song on Periscope and revealed to her fans that she worked with Tribbett. In the video, she incorrectly reported that she had handled the songwriting by herself. Tribbett explained its concept and his collaboration with Fantasia to Christine Thomasos of The Christian Post, saying: [...] "We've been talking about working together for a minute. So when the opportunity came it <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a no brainer". He said that he instantly agreed to work with Fantasia after receiving a phone call to write a song for her. Fantasia had contacted Tribbett at the suggestion of music executive Ron Fair. Prior to the writing process, Tribbett had asked to [...] "do it on [...] terms" [...] and [...] "maintain the integrity of his message" [...] by creating an inspirational gospel record. He used Fantasia's testimony, as well as his own experiences with God, as inspiration for the lyrics. He described the song {{as the result of a}} close connection between Fantasia and himself: [...] "I basically just combined testimonies between her and myself when I wrote the song and it resonated so richly with her, her audience and with everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul credits Public Enemy {{as being}} a {{significant}} influence on early De La Soul production, saying, [...] "Early Public Enemy production used layers upon layers and layers, and their arrangements were always super duper incredible to me.

50|$|Saying that Laura Restrepo's writing <b>is</b> {{beautiful}} <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> {{saying that}} the Eiffel Tower is in Europe. Every word in Delirium is perfectly chosen, painfully honest, and brutally effective. Restrepo chooses her words like a poet, with infinite care. Even without her superb writing, though, Restrepo's novel would be excellent, her story intriguing and engrossing.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{interesting}} {{comments on}} Grossman in Martin Scorsese's film No Direction Home. One is Dylan's: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a Colonel Tom Parker figure... all immaculately dressed, {{every time you}} see him. You could smell him coming." [...] The other is John Cohen's: [...] "I don't think Albert manipulated Bob, because Bob was weirder than Albert." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2005, Carlton {{said she}} was to enter the {{recording}} studio the following month with producer Linda Perry, {{with whom she had}} previously collaborated after executives at A Records sent her into the studio to record a re-release single for Harmonium. [...] The album was influenced by Carlton's breakup with its co-producer, Stephan Jenkins, and Carlton said {{that one of the reasons}} they remained friends was that [...] "nothing took precedence over the music ... No matter what was going on in the emotional realm, all we cared about was the album. It created this kinetic environment that <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> Fleetwood Mac. It made for better music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Parachute landing with propulsive assist, {{similar to}} that used by the Soyuz (spacecraft): [...] "The whole landing system is {{designed}} so that it’s survivable if there’s no propulsive assist at all.

5000|$|Collins {{explained}} the OLE value proposition to Forbes: [...] "These {{types of things}} were already happening—but {{it was like the}} Wild Wild West. Nothing was coordinated.

The need was there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} several paradoxes and metaphors, such as [...] "You can't fill your cup, until you empty all it has". According to McIlrath, the song's title {{comes from the}} idea that [...] "Rise Against <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a satellite {{and every once in}} a while we're in orbit over you - we pop into your lives and play show".|$|R
2500|$|Lewis {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "e felt like happiness is something everyone strives to have, and sometimes it's not just about being happy, but if you have obstacles in your life that you have to get over to be happy. And it's just about that striving to get there. t <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> looking back at all of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song." [...] The song was released with two B-sides: [...] "Let It Rain" [...] in Europe and Japan, and [...] "Fly Here Now", only in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Hell's Kitchen {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Superjesus {{on the eve of}} the Big Day Out in Adelaide on Australia Day long-weekend, January 1996. Tennent {{provided}} the new name. Berryman explained, [...] "It was basically just a piss-take on commonly used words in the '90s. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, [...] "Jesus Built My Hotrod", the Jesus Lizard, Jesus Jones; there's just heaps of Jesus' out there in the music world so we thought we would have that and super <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a '90s catch word."

2500|$|Zamora {{attended}} the 1993 Lesbian and Gay March on Washington, where a fellow AIDS educator named Sean Sasser introduced himself to Zamora. Although Sasser did not characterize his meeting Zamora as {{love at first}} sight (they were both involved with other people at the time), he was moved by Zamora's presence and conviction, recalling, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> 'Wow.' I had never run across someone who was as good at it as he was." [...] Sasser encouraged Zamora to call him if Zamora ever visited San Francisco, where Sasser had been living for a couple of years, Sasser subsequently learned that producers of the MTV reality TV show, [...] were looking for an HIV positive person to cast in the 1994 season in San Francisco.|$|E
5000|$|Regarded {{by some as}} the {{greatest}} defensive line coach of all time, Teerlinck established an NFL presence in the early 1990s. [...] "John Teerlinck <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> Mr. Miyagi", John Randle said. [...] "He's very unorthodox. A different breed. Rough around the edges.

500|$|For Streep, {{the most}} {{significant}} thing about the film was that [...] "his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men {{came up to me}} and said, 'I know what you felt <b>like,</b> this <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> my life.'

Lakshmi is her mother's only child, {{but she has a}} younger paternal half-brother and half-sister. Her half-sister has worked as an actress and classical dancer but is now pursuing a career working with children with special needs. In an interview in The Guardian, Lakshmi said, [...] "My father had quit his job as an executive at Pfizer to manage her career.

2500|$|Antwon Tanner portrays Antwon [...] "Skills" [...] Taylor, one of Lucas' oldest {{friends and}} another of those who played at the Rivercourt as children. Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an {{important}} character, but later had come to doubt it. [...] "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, and I was told that once we got picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. [...] "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> 'Uh-oh.'

2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E
5000|$|Milo {{has stuck}} with me for almost nine years now, so I wouldn't exactly feel right about just {{continuing}} to call us the Descendents.

2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a nice hand on your shoulder, {{as opposed to}} someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{release date}} {{was once again}} pushed back to January or March 2005 while a final {{recording}} session was held in Mississauga, Ontario to re-record most of the songs {{that would make the}} album. During these sessions, guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian visited with them and contributed his guitar playing to several tracks. [...] "He [...] came {{in the last couple of}} sessions to help us out and to get a little different guitar perspective on there." [...] Duncan Coutts explained, [...] "We had a couple of our friends that came and played. One guy, Adam, played a little B3, and Jason Lader played on that song. He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was just about a musical team." [...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier. According to Coutts, [...] "I don't know what would have happened if not for that time." ...|$|E
