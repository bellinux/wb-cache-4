When his ships reached the port of Tangier, Morocco, on 28 October, Rozhestvensky split his forces and ordered his older ships, {{including}} Navarin and Sissoi Veliky, to proceed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to rendezvous with him in Madagascar as previously planned. Under the command of Rear Admiral Dmitry von Fölkersam, they departed that night and reached Souda Bay, Crete, a week later and Port Said, Egypt two <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> The two forces reunited at the island of Nosy Be on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements. The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov.

5|$|In 1894, Wurtenburg {{was hired}} to replace former Yale {{teammate}} John A. Hartwell as the {{head coach of the}} US Naval Academy football team. Hartwell's 1893 team had amassed a record of 5–3, including a win over rival Army and a loss to rival Penn. Wurtenburg began his coaching career on October 6, leading his team to a 6–6 tie with the Elizabeth Athletic Club of New Jersey at Worden Field on the Naval Academy campus in Annapolis. His first win as a coach came over two weeks later, on October 21, in a 12–0 shutout of rival Georgetown; it was followed by a defeat of the Carlisle Indian School. His first and only loss of the season came on October 27, at the hands of rival Penn in a 12–0 shutout. At about that time, Wurtenburg left the country and traveled to Germany to complete his medical studies. The team recovered and defeated Lehigh on November 3, then tied rival Penn State. The season ended two <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> match with a 30–6 defeat of Baltimore City College. The team did not compete against their major rival Army that year, after violent fights between fans the previous year; President Grover Cleveland banned the game, which would not be played again until it was reinstated in 1899 by Theodore Roosevelt. Sometime during November, Wurtenburg returned from Germany along with fellow Yale medical graduate A.S. Cheney, and announced his intention to practice medicine in New Haven. That year, he received certification, and he expressed interest in eye, throat, and ear treatment.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the ransoming process, the Cázares {{were allowed}} to talk with their {{remaining}} relatives in three occasions. In their first phone conversation, the victims talked about their concern for their wives and children. Their second conversation was a lot shorter and emotive for the Cázares, however. By July 27, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash deliver in order to release them. The Cázares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a disclosed location for a white van {{that was supposed to}} deliver their relatives. The van never came and the phone line that the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. <b>Weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> the family decided to contact law enforcement.|$|E

25|$|Brunk {{racked up}} an astounding catalog of {{injuries}} during his ECW tenure, including broken ribs, a broken jaw, and breaking his neck twice. The {{first time he}} broke his neck was during his match with Chris Benoit at the 1994 November to Remember. Benoit threw Sabu with the intention {{that he would take}} a flapjack bump but Brunk attempted to turn mid-air and take a back body drop bump instead, which {{he was not able to}} do and landed on his head causing the injury. The other was during a match against Taz in December 1998, when Brunk took a Taz–Plex through a table and landed incorrectly. Brunk was able to recover from the neck injuries and return to wrestling, and he even wore a neck brace in his return match in the United States a month following the injury at Taz's hands; by Brunk's account, however, he started actively wrestling in Japan with his partner on a short tour a little over two <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> injury. Brunk departed from ECW for the final time in early 2000.|$|E
25|$|Once the Cázares {{decided to}} search for help within law enforcement, the local police stated {{that they were going}} to {{investigate}} the case. However, about a month in, they stated in a letter written to the Cázares that the case was outside of their jurisdiction. The family tried to contact the police with e-mails and phone calls, and even attempted to get a hold of the Matamoros mayor Alfonso Sánchez Garza, but their messages were not answered. In September 13, 2011, the Cázares issued a formal complaint at the Public Ministry of Matamoros (Spanish: Ministerio Público de Matamoros) and the case was opened by state authorities in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas. A family member who happened to be a U.S. citizen also contacted the FBI and asked them for help in the case. The case was brought to the attention of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who promised to support the investigation. A few <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> one of the alleged kidnappers was arrested in Texas following a traffic violation. That same month, a Tamaulipas anti-kidnapping squad began to work on the case and recollected the testimonies of the Cázares that were kidnapped.|$|E
25|$|The game shipped with version 3189. The first update, or patch, to Supreme Commander was version 3217. Released {{shortly after}} the game launch, this update {{included}} game tweaks and balances, {{and a number of}} small bug fixes. Support for the Direct2Drive version of the game was introduced, as well as a minimalist version of the user interface. Version 3220, released on March 5, 2007, notably removed the SecuROM disk checking from the game. This enables the player to run the game without the game DVD in the DVD drive. Polish, Russian, and Chinese localizations were excluded from this change. Version 3223 included bug fixes only. It has been called a 'specific purpose patch' by the developer Gas Powered Games. Update 3251, was a highly anticipated update, mainly because of the plethora of changes relating to the balance between playable factions. A cartographic view of the map was also introduced. Hotfix 3254 solved a few issues discovered shortly after 3251 was released. It was introduced on June 7, 2007. Two <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> patch, version 3255 fixed a peer desynchronisation bug, one {{that could be used to}} deceive the rating system (called an exploit in gaming jargon). On July 30, 2007, patch 3260 was released. It included 3 new units, and some bug fixes and tweaks. On October 8, 2007, patch 3269 was released, including one new unit for each faction, and gameplay tweaks. On January 13, 2008 the final update to Supreme Commander was released; Patch 3280 added amBX support to the game.|$|E

500|$|On March 1, 2004, Hennigan debuted on the Raw brand {{under the}} ring name [...] "Johnny Blaze". His gimmick {{was that he}} was the {{apprentice}} and assistant of the Raw General Manager, Eric Bischoff. The next week his name was changed to [...] "Johnny Spade", and three <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> it was changed to [...] "Johnny Nitro". The Nitro name, which finally stuck, was a reference to WCW Monday Nitro, the flagship show of World Championship Wrestling for which Bischoff had previously worked. To drive the point home, he began using the Nitro theme as his ring entrance music. Nitro acted as Bischoff's apprentice and assistant until June, when he was sent back to OVW. To explain his departure, Nitro lost a match on June 7 episode of Raw against Eugene, which carried the stipulation that upon his loss, he also lost his job.|$|E
