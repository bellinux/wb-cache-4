5|$|Like Angelou's {{previous}} volumes, {{the book}} {{has been described as}} autobiographical fiction, though most critics, as well as Angelou, have characterized it as autobiography. Although most critics consider Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings more favorably, The Heart of a <b>Woman</b> <b>has</b> received positive reviews. It was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people. This is also the case for African-American autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. The Heart of a <b>Woman</b> <b>has</b> three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E

5|$|As they travel, a {{man named}} Baxter (Michael Smiley), who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where there are crucified and hanged bodies. As the woman {{is about to be}} tortured, Jem kills Baxter. They {{continue}} traveling to the transmitter, while the <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> visions of past events. When they reach the transmitter, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, {{the young}} Danish {{archaeologist}} J. J. A. Worsaae disagreed the Haraldskær Woman was Gunnhild. A pioneer in archaeological stratigraphy, Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldskær Woman dated from the Iron Age. Later radiocarbon dating confirmed {{the body was}} not Gunnhild, but rather {{a woman of the}} early Iron Age who lived about 490 BC. Though no one proved the Haraldskær <b>Woman</b> <b>has</b> any royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north transept of Saint Nicolai Church.|$|E
30|$|Results: 2 <b>women</b> <b>had</b> {{definite}} intrauterine pregnancies. Both miscarried within 48 hours. 1 <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> thickened endometrium but no trophoblast on biopsy.

5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the three bears was in {{circulation}} before the publication of Southey's tale. In 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the old woman for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday. Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk; Southey's old <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> no motive for entering the house, but Mure's old woman is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed; Southey's old woman runs away when discovered, but Mure's old woman is impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Bhagyalakshmi, a young <b>woman,</b> <b>has</b> a car {{accident}} while returning from a party and is hospitalised with severe head injuries. When she recovers, she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia and she fails to recognise her own parents. She mentally regresses {{to the state of}} a child. While she is undergoing treatment, she is kidnapped and sold to the madam of a brothel. Srinivas, also known as Cheenu, comes to Chennai to meet his old friend. Together, they visit the brothel to relax. The madam sends Bhagyalakshmi, renamed Vijaya, to his room. Cheenu realises that she is mentally still a child and pities her. He learns that she is from a cultured family, and that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution.|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} evidence that {{breast cancer is}} a heterogeneous disease presented by different phenotypes and that white <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a higher breast cancer incidence rate, whereas black <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a higher mortality rate. It is also well known that white <b>women</b> <b>have</b> lower incidence rates than black women until approximately age 40, when rate curves cross over and white <b>women</b> <b>have</b> higher rates. The goal {{of this study was}} to validate the risk of white and black women to breast cancer phenotypes, stratified by statuses of the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors...|$|R

Carbetocin appears to cause less adverse effects. More research is needed to find the cost effectiveness of using carbetocin.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|Meera (Ayesha Takia), {{a simple}} Rajasthani Hindu <b>woman,</b> <b>has</b> {{everything}} {{in her life}} in accordance with customs and traditions: her formative years, her recent marriage into a traditional Rajasthani family and her daily chores {{within the walls of}} her haveli. Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh (Girish Karnad), mother, Gowri Singh (Prateeksha Lonkar), his paternal grandmother (Uttara Baokar) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated to know that Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> also {{been a matter of}} debate. The inscription which accompanies her image clearly includes her title, despotissa, as well as the word “daughter”. Based on a possible reading of her name as Anna, she has been identified as Anna Neda, the Serbian wife of Michael Shishman, which is in line with the first identification of the despot. Nikolova believes that {{it is possible that the}} woman is Anna Neda even if the despot is her son rather than her husband. She theorises that Anna Neda settled in Vidin after Michael Shishman's second marriage and owned a personal domain which included Donja Kamenica. Another reading of the inscription deciphers the name of the despotissa as Elena.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1975, {{numerous}} other empirical {{studies have found}} evidence of gender symmetry. For example, in the United States, the National Comorbidity Study of 1990-1992 found 18.4% of men and 17.4% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced minor IPV, and 5.5% of men and 6.5% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced severe IPV. In England and Wales, the 1995 [...] "Home Office Research Study 191" [...] found that in the twelve {{months prior to the}} survey, 4.2% of both men and woman between the ages of 16 and 59 had been assaulted by an intimate. The Canadian General Social Survey of 2000 found that from 1994 to 1999, 4% of men and 4% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 22% of men and 28% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 7% of men and 8% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present. The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey, looking at the years 1999-2004 found similar data; 4% of men and 3% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 16% of men and 21% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 6% of men and 7% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present.|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: <b>Women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> <b>Women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been an obscure group. Conclusion: The conclusion was that <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> not been included in the STI information available on the internet within the county councils of Kalmar and Kronoberg...|$|R
5|$|The largest Chadian {{delegation}} {{to reach the}} Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain; each time, Chad's National Olympic Committee sent six athletes. During the 1992 games, the NOC sent the nation's first female Olympian. Since then (and up to the Beijing games), at least one <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> {{been a part of}} the Chadian delegation. The smallest contingency of Chadian Olympians occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when only Kaltouma Nadjina competed on the country's behalf. The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes—one man (30-year-old Moumi Sébergué) and one woman (15-year-old Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert), both participants in track events. Ndikert was Chad's flagbearer at the ceremonies. Up to and including the Beijing games, there has yet to have been a medalist from Chad.|$|E
