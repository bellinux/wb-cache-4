Each of the 10 t capsules represents one of the London Boroughs, and holds up to 25 people, who are free to walk around inside the capsule, though seating is provided. The wheel rotates at 26 cm per second (about 0.9 kph or 0.6 mph) so that one revolution takes about 30 minutes. It does not usually stop to take on passengers; the rotation rate is slow enough to allow passengers to walk on and off the moving capsules at ground level. It is, however, stopped to allow disabled or elderly passengers time to embark and disembark safely.|$|R

First, to predict performance of the bearing seal lip, we used the non-linear finite element analysis. And then, we compared the analysis results with the test results to verify the finite element model. The objective function in optimizing process was obtained from results of the mud slurry test, which is one of many tests for evaluating performance of wheel bearing. After the mud slurry test for the four models which have the similar cross-sectional shape, we measured the wear area of the seal lip and the moisture content in grease. The objective function has been chosen by comparing the results of mud slurry test and characteristics of seal lip, such as contact force, contact area, contact pressure, and interference.

40|$|LectureIn {{most natural}} gas applications, turboexpanders are {{operating}} close to {{or on the}} dew point line and a mixture entering the turboexpander impeller {{is a combination of}} liquid and gas phases of the natural gas. The presence of the liquid phase may induce rotordynamic instabilities during operation. Special care should be taken in the case of magnetic bearings. This paper will present a revamp of two turboexpander-compressors equipped with active magnetic bearings (AMB). The application is liquid natural gas (LNG) rejection and gas injection on a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) barge. Prior to upgrade, the turboexpanders had accumulated more than 250 thousand hours in operation. The objective of the upgrade was to adapt to new process conditions and to increase the power of the turboexpanders. After the re-wheeling of turboexpanders, numerous trips due to violent subsynchronous vibrations were experienced. The root-cause analysis revealed that the presence of liquids in the front <b>wheel</b> labyrinth <b>seals</b> caused fluid-induced non-synchronous vibrations (NSV).

These superior properties make cermet a promising material {{for use in}} several aero-engine components, turbo pumps, heat exchangers, fusion reactors, armour plates, wear resistant components as blast nozzles and <b>wheels</b> dressing tools, <b>seal</b> rings, valve components and bearings, oxidation resistant material as refractory lining, coating to protect materials from corrosive environments and combustion engines. SiC-B 4 C based cermets are being developed as remarkable engineering materials for their outstanding physical and mechanical properties, including high hardness, lightweight, high wear resistance, high melting point, oxidation resistance and great resistance to chemical attack. Fabrication of highly dense SiC-B 4 C based ceramic composite is quite difficult due to its high melting point and strong covalent bond. Properties of these materials can be improved by reducing initial particle size of powders and incorporation of metallic elements into ceramic matrix. The fine and disordered structure produced by mechanical milling increases the molecular diffusion channel during sintering and enhance the densification. Incorporation of Si and Al into SiC-B 4 C ceramic matrix improves the properties since it acts as a binder, enhances densification, and lowers the sintering temperature.

50|$|Body shells {{are painted}} in a semi-clean {{environment}} using solvent-based paint. Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any oils {{picked up on}} the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an anti-corrosion paint dip called ED (Electrocoat Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, both inside and outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant, to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads are added to the floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's <b>wheel</b> arches are <b>sealed</b> using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the underseal to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the Surfacer Coat, then into the Surfacer Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections picked up within the Surfacer coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections picked up in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await {{the next step in the}} production process.|$|R
30|$|Mechanical {{behavior}} of various machine elements, such as gears, cams, <b>wheels,</b> rails and <b>sealing</b> parts {{are influenced by}} the interaction between contact elements and surfaces. Contact fatigue is a surface-pitting type failure, defined as kind of damage caused by changes in material microstructure which result in crack initiation followed by crack propagation, under the influence of time-dependent rolling/sliding contact loads (Fajdiga and Sraml 2009). Development of modern engineering application with ecological and economical aspects and development of devices operating under extreme operating conditions (high temperature, vacuum) needs some potential substitute for traditional materials. Silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) based ceramics presents good substitute for these conditions due to their hardness, excellent chemical, and stability under a broad range of temperature, low density, low thermal expansion and high specific stiffness (Dill 1996). In the 1950 s, the interest in Si 3 N 4 increased when it was prepared for refractory application. Biocompatibility of Si 3 N 4 has presented scope for its use in the field of biomedical also (Neumann et al. 2004). Last 50  years research in the field of orthopedics trying to evaluate the biomaterials for hip joint replacement with improved performance in terms of extending joint life. In early days different kind of natural materials like wood, glue, rubber, tissue from living forms and manufactured materials like iron, gold, and zinc were used as biomaterials based on trial and error. Biomaterials are such materials which are intended to replace a part or function of the body in reliably economically and physiologically acceptable manner. It is estimated that approximately 250, 000 knee replacements and 1 million hip replacements are carried out per year (Sculco 1995). It is expected that this number will double till 2025 as a result of aging populations worldwide and growing demand for a higher quality of life (Rakhorst and Ploeg 2008; Steven et al. 2007). The first metal-on-metal (CoCr–CoCr) total hip replacement (THR) was unsatisfactory in terms of high friction forces and high rate of wear. Titanium alloys and stainless steel are also frequently used in THR, but the main risk with use of metal alloy implants is the release of metal ions due to wear and creating a negative effect like aseptic loosening caused by adverse biological reactions due to wear products. Therefore, metal-on-ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing became advantages or preferable to the metal-on-metal system. A lot of literature from hip simulator studies proved improvement in wear resistance of cross-linked UHMWPE (McKellop et al. 1999; Muratoglu et al. 1999). Since from last four decades, bio-inert alumina ceramic (aluminum oxide) have presented an attractive alternative for THR bearing surface in terms of improved wear resistance and extended joint life. In late eighteenth century, the controlled implantation of bioceramic started in dental with the use of plaster of Paris or gypsum for bone filling. Ceramic bearings were first introduced as alternatives to polyethylene (PE) bearings in THR about a decade after Sir John Charnley introduced the first durable THR with a metal-PE articulation. In 1965, the first alumina (Al 2 O 3) material dedicated for hip joint was patented, and pioneering application of bioceramic was replacing traditional metallic femoral heads of hip prostheses using high density and pure alumina. The Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 like oxide have a lengthy history in the field of hip and knee joint replacement providing a tougher bearing surface with low wear rate. With high fracture toughness and more resistant to crack propagation than alumina, Si 3 N 4 presents an alternative to oxide ceramic with comparable wear rate (Bal et al. 2009; Cappie et al. 2010). Mode of failure in THR is related to tribology i.e. wear of cup and head. Accumulation of wear at implant leads to aseptic loosening and failure of THR. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the generation of wear particle in the implant. Olofsson et al. (2012) conducted sliding contact wear test using pin-on-disc (PoD) tribometer with Si 3 N 4 and CoCr disc against Si 3 N 4 and Al 2 O 3 ball in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and bovine serum. Si 3 N 4 sliding against Si 3 N 4 showed low wear rate in both PBS and bovine serum comparable to other pairs. Xu and Kato (2000) investigated wear performance of silicon nitride sliding against itself in water showing the low coefficient of friction and low wear. The wear of silicon nitride in water occurs mainly due to the tribo-chemical dissolution of material without the release of the solid particle. Boshitskaya et al. (1996) presented that silicon nitride powder dissolve in blood serum, gastric juice, and a synthetic biochemical media at pH 7.4, suggesting the use of silicon nitride for hip joint replacement with less wear and those produced wear particles would be biodegradable. Considering orthopedic application improved the coefficient of friction and low wear rate of silicon nitride are confirmed and advantages over CoCr alloy (Rahaman et al. 2007). The ability of silicon nitride to be formulated into porous substrate and a hard bearing surface makes it best alternative in orthopedic and THR materials list. Hexagonal boron nitride is well known solid situ lubricating material with biocompatibility (Gangopadhyay et al. 1997; Saito et al. 1999; Shah et al. 2013). Anabtawi et al. (2008) evaluated the biocompatibility of boron coatings and Klepper et al. (2008) presented tribomechanical properties of thin boron coatings on cobalt alloy in an orthopedic application with no loss of coating during the test. The lubrication properties of h-boron nitride are comparable to those of phospholipids, which are the best lubricant in human (Pawlak et al. 2008). Bor Incorporation of the solid lubricant in Si 3 N 4 can be considered to improve the tribological performance of Si 3 N 4. Formation of an oxide of hydrated layers [H 3 BO 3 and BN(H 2 O)x] has a significant effect on the tribological performance of Si 3 N 4 –BN composites, reducing the wear coefficient. Carrapichano et al. (2002) conducted sliding wear test on PoD tribometer for Si 3 N 4 –BN composite in a self-mated pair, with 10, 18 and 25  vol% of BN in Si 3 N 4. They concluded that addition of Boron up to 10  % improved tribological properties of Si 3 N 4 and further addition affect to mechanical properties of Si 3 N 4. Chen et al. (2008) investigated sliding wear {{behavior of}} Si 3 N 4 –hBN composite with 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30  vol% of hBN in Si 3 N 4 against Si 3 N 4 using PoD tribometer. They reported that friction coefficient reduces up to 0.19 for 20  % hBN in Si 3 N 4.|$|R
