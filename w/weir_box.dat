40|$|Dreissenid mussels alter {{particle}} transport {{dynamics in}} the near shore environment of the Great Lakes by intercepting, retaining and recycling suspended solids {{that might otherwise be}} exported to the offshore environment (Hecky et al., 2004). Particulate materials filtered from the water column by dreissenids are subsequently released as either feces or pseudofeces (Walz, 1978). This bio-transformation process alters the nature (grain size distribution, settling velocity and density) and transport properties (critical shear stress for erosion, erosion rates and bed stability) of particulate matter in surficial sediments. While knowledge of the transport characteristics of this material is required to refine particle transport dynamics and energy flow models in the Great Lakes, few studies have been specifically conducted to directly quantify these processes. An annular flume was used to determine the bed stability, rate of erosion and critical shear stress for erosion of dreissenid biodeposits. Materials studied in the flume consisted of 1) a combination of biodeposits and surface sediments collected from dreissenid beds and 2) biodeposits harvested in a <b>weir</b> <b>box</b> with dreissenids. The results show that erosion characteristics and sediment transport properties were strongly influenced by bed age; however particle sizes did not increase in the presence of mussels as originally speculated. Bed stability increased after 7 days, with a τcrit of 0. 26 Pa compared to the 2 and 14 day consolidation periods (τcrit= 0. 13 and 0. 15 Pa respectively). In 2010, following a 2 day consolidation period, pure biodeposits harvested in the <b>weir</b> <b>box</b> had a critical shear stress for erosion of 0. 052 Pa. The decrease in bed stability found in biodeposits from 2010 compared to the 2008 biodeposit mixture, may be a result of a more diffuse biofilm developing on the highly organic substrate. The mixture of biodeposits collected in 2008 were a combination organic and inorganic materials which may be creating a nutrient limited environment, where biofilm structure consists of more tightly organized biofilm cells and as a result enhance stability in the bed sediments. The decrease observed after 14 days is likely a result of the microbes depleting their resources and dying off. Due to the added roughness the mussels created in the flume, τcrit could not be measured and critical revolutions per minute (RPM) for erosion are reported for flume runs with mussels. During experiments conducted in 2009 with pure biodeposits and mussels the critical RPM was 5. 83 while in 2010 in the presence of mussels a critical RPM was not observed. Settling experiments found biodeposits from both years (2008 and 2010) had decreased settling velocities when compared to different sediment types from lacustrine environments. I speculate that the added enrichment of the surficial sediments by mussel biodeposits is enhancing the process of biostabilization and increasing the bed stability and that the presence mussels themselves may additionally be enhancing bed stability by inhibiting flow from reaching the surface sediments/biodeposits...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OVERVIEW: Dredging {{supports}} {{ports and}} harbors and the nation’s transportation infrastructure by maintaining or creating navigation channels, {{similar to the}} way that highway construction maintains or creates highways. One of the primary aspects of any dredging project is deciding where to place the dredged material. In basic terms there are only two choices; place the material in the water or place it on land. When dredged material is placed on land, the process is usually called ‘upland placement of dredged material. ’ When placed upland, dredged material is usually accompanied by large amounts of water and a containment area is usually required to temporarily hold the water and permanently hold the dredged material. The containment area is known as a dredged material management area (DMMA), dredged material disposal facility (DMDF), confined disposal facility (CDF), or by similar nomenclature. In order to separate water from dredged material, a DMMA usually includes an outlet structure for letting supernatant water return to the natural water body from which it was entrained by the dredge. The outlet structure is usually a <b>weir</b> <b>box.</b> In general, DMMA weirs are designed with three major purposes in mind: 1) to retain all of the dredged sediment solids within the DMMA, 2) to let the excess water leave the DMMA and return to the natural water body, and 3) to prevent scour or resuspension of settled solids and control the release of water {{in such a way that}} suspended solids (usually measured with respect to turbidity) within the return water are kept to a minimum. A detailed discussion of weir design and operation for this purpose can be found in U. S. Arm...|$|E

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 Pervious concrete, photocatalytic concrete, and photocatalytic pervious concrete are emerging technologies in the pavement industry, {{and have been}} researched {{in order to determine}} the efficacy of these technologies in environmental sustainability on a wide scale. In this thesis, the effects of photocatalytically active cement on a highway were studied, along with the affects of photocatalytic pervious and conventional pervious concrete shoulders. A laboratory experimental setup was conducted simultaneously as a comparison between theoretical and practical implementations of this technology. The results of the laboratory test indicated that there was not a significant increase in nitrate, but the nitrite levels increased significantly. This could be indicative of the rolls humidity and total sunlight play in the reactivity of the photocatalytic concrete, but needs further assessment for conformation. It may also suggest the role of retention time of the water within the pervious concrete as well. The field results indicate that nitrate levels were present early on in the construction phase of the project, even prior to opening the highway to the public and to large traffic volumes. Data indicates that the base was drainable and drained quickly, despite the amount of fines within subbase. It was also determined that water had an effect on the temperature of the pavements, as heat was drawn away from the subbase during rain events. Further data needs to be collected and analyzed in order to more certainly determine effect of this technology on water quality. Further assessment need also be conducted on the use of pervious concrete as highway shoulders. This was suspected to be the first highway pavement in the world in which photocatalytically active cements were utilized for air and water quality improvements, and it is also suspected to be the first highway in which pervious concrete shoulders were used for stormwater management.

40|$|Whole milk fouling of {{surfaces}} within {{dairy products}} processing plants, especially that which occurs on heat treatment equipment, {{is an important}} operating problem, threatening the quality of product and reducing thermal and mechanical efficiency of equipment. A fouling monitoring system was developed using a commercial heat flux probe and temperature sensor. The fouling monitor was installed in two unit operations of a custom built milk powder pilot plant. The unit operations replicated heat treatments found in plate heat exchangers and falling film evaporators. The research plate heat exchanger consisted of six miniature plate heat exchangers or modules in series. Individual modules could be isolated at any point during a run allowing access to the fouling deposit. The research falling film evaporator was a flat plate attached to a steam chamber and milk <b>weir</b> <b>box.</b> The onset and build-up of whole milk fouling on the evaporator plate was viewed through a sight window installed in the evaporator casing. Trials conducted with the research plate heat exchanger showed that the monitoring system could detect whole milk fouling {{in terms of a}} reduction in the overall heat transfer coefficient. This reduction was shown to directly correspond to an increase in fouling deposit thickness. For the same bulk milk temperature, the fouling rate decreased significantly when the surface was unheated compared with heated surfaces. This observation lead to a set of experiments that manipulated the start up procedure on both the milk and heating medium side of the research plate heat exchanger. More fouling was observed on plates after air start up (on the milk side) than on plates after water start up. Similarly, Surface Conditioning by Operational Protocol (SCOP) extended the fouling induction period. The SCOP trials compared steady state heating with unsteady state heating during start-up. Similar amounts of fouling were observed on plates removed from the steady state heated modules after 30 minutes and on plates removed from the unsteady state modules after 9 hours. These results indicate that the state of the stainless steel surface when the. milk first makes contact has an important effect on the subsequent rate of fouling. It is recommended that future work aims to identify which milk components deposit first onto the surface and what influence they have on inhibiting or facilitating fouling. The fouling monitoring system successfully estimated the extent of fouling for all of the trials. Industry trials for the fouling monitoring system, particularly on heated surfaces are recommended. The system will allow local areas of intense fouling to be mapped within the processing plants. A number of recommendations are presented concerning future work associated with start up procedure manipulation, evaporator trials and seasonal variation trials...|$|E
