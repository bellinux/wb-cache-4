40|$|Dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the microcutting process because target material piled up on the tool–chip– workpiece interface can alter the cutting geometry. The target of this study is to model and simulate the microorthogonal cutting process in the presence of dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> in order to investigate the effects of this phenomenon on the micromachining process outputs (cutting force, thrust force and chip thickness) and stress distribution, equivalent plastic strain and temperature inside the workpiece shear zones. For this purpose, the finite element method with explicit dynamic solution and adiabatic heating effect along with arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian approach is used. It is shown that the finite element models with current state-of-the-art assumptions cannot take into account the dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> by default. For this reason, dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> is artificially introduced on the rounded tool edge in this study for carrying out a proper analysis. Several simulations with different dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> geometries are performed and obtained results show that prediction of cutting force, thrust force and chip thickness are sensitive to the presence of dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> and its geometry. Micro-orthogonal cutting experiments are carried out on tubular AISI 1045 workpieces for validating and interpreting simulated results. The error between predicted and experimental data is calculated, and it is shown that simulation performances can be improved by considering the dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> into the process model. For example, it is possible to reduce the error to less than 5...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple design method of a ceramic pressure-tight housing having an {{extended}} length of cylinder and <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> Ceramics have higher compressive strength and lower specific gravity than typical metals. Moreover, {{they are free}} from erosion by seawater. For that reason, we can produce light pressure-tight ceramic housings that have good durability for deep-water applications. The proposed ceramic housings have greater buoyancy than metal housings. We also propose a simpler design method of <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> We confirmed its validity through Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis and hydraulic pressure tests using small-sized ceramic housings with <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> Date of Conference: 10 - 14 June 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The energy-generating {{capability}} of a cymbal transducer was studied {{in order to}} supply the power of low-consumption electric products. An analytical model of the cymbal transducer was established by the hydrostatic piezoelectric constant method. The relation between the material of <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> {{as well as the}} structure of transducer and energy generation were analyzed by numerical simulation. The simulation validation was done by the element software ANSYS. The results of the study show that, in the same force, the materials of <b>metal</b> <b>cap,</b> the radius of cavity bottom, and the thickness of <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> have bigger influence on the voltage outputted, the radius of cavity top have less influence on the voltage outputted. ...|$|R

40|$|Part of {{energies}} in {{asphalt pavement}} caused by vehicle {{can be converted}} into electric energy by piezoelectric transducer. A bridge-shaped transducer is selected to harvest energy because of its reasonable efficiency and moderate stiffness close to asphalt pavement. This paper is to compare the performance of Bridge transducers with trapezoidal, arc and arch structure through finite element analysis (FEA) and laboratory test. Results show that the arch Bridge has higher energy conversion efficiency and the trapezoidal Bridge has stronger ability to resist pressure. For arc and trapezoidal Bridge, the maximum tensile stress and shear stress are both in the inner corner of contact area between cap and PZT (lead zirconate titanate) disk. They were broken because of the cracking of PZT at the stress concentrations area. For arch Bridge, the maximum tensile stress increases with thickness of <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> but decrease with modulus, and maximum shear stress decreases first and increases later with increasing thickness and modulus of <b>metal</b> <b>cap.</b> In laboratory test, its cracking area is shifted from edge to inner corner of contact area between cap and PZT disk with increasing thickness of <b>metal</b> <b>cap.</b> The electric potential generated by arch Bridge decreased with increasing thickness and modulus of <b>metal</b> <b>cap.</b> Under the load of 0. 7 MPa, the electric potential is about 286 V for an arch Bridge transducer with 0. 4 mm thickness of stainless steel cap, and its storage electric energy is 0. 6 mJ. The designed arch Bridge transducer is suggested as the optimum one for harvesting energy from asphalt pavement...|$|R

40|$|A report {{describes}} an improved high-voltage isolator for preventing electrical discharge along the flow {{path of a}} propellant gas being fed from a supply at a spacecraft chassis electrical potential to an ion thruster at a potential as high as multiple kilovolts. The isolator must survive launch vibration and must remain electrically nonconductive for thousands of hours under conditions that, {{in the absence of}} proper design, would cause formation of electrically conductive sputtered metal, carbon, and/or decomposed hydrocarbons on its surfaces. The isolator includes an alumina cylinder containing a spiral channel filled with a porous medium made from alumina microbeads fired together with an alumina slurry. Connections to gas-transport tubes are made {{at both ends of the}} alumina cylinder by means of <b>metal</b> <b>caps</b> containing fine-mesh screens to prevent passage of loose alumina particles. The outer surface of the alumina cylinder is convoluted to lengthen the electrical path between the <b>metal</b> <b>caps</b> and to afford shadow shielding to minimize the probability of formation of a continuous deposit that would electrically connect the ends. A flanged cylindrical <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> that surrounds the alumina cylinder without touching one of the ends provides additional shadow shielding...|$|R

40|$|Previously {{the authors}} have {{presented}} both theoretical and experimental work discussing the operating mechanism of a wire rope held in a tapered socket {{by means of a}} cast resin cone. The work reported here extends the investigation to address {{the question of whether the}} same socket fabricated with <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> operates in the same manner. To date, previous investigations have compared the operational efficiency of resin and <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> in terms of both strength and/or fatigue endurance. Some other work has analysed the operation of resin sockets or specific cast metal terminations. This paper seeks to draw the results from this work together, and, in addition to a theoretical analysis, presents experimental data obtained from a direct comparison of the operation mechanism for the same sockets filled with resin or <b>white</b> <b>metal.</b> Results show that <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> terminations have a very different distribution of stresses along the length of the socket basket from resin terminations, and a smaller but still significant amount of socket draw. For both types of termination the socket draw develops high frictional gripping forces which can transfer the load from the rope to the socket. The different stress distributions mean that the consequences of termination fabrication defects may not be the same for resin and <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> terminations...|$|R
