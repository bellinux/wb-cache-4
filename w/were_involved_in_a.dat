5|$|British {{participants}} <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} controversies regarding the reallocation of medals during the Games. Shelly Woods was initially awarded the silver {{medal in the}} women's 5000m T54, but a rerun was ordered by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) after the Australian, US and Swiss teams protested the result because six competitors <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crash on the penultimate lap. When the race was rerun Woods won the bronze medal. David Weir believed he had {{won the gold medal}} in the men's 800m T54 but a rerun of the race was ordered after it was discovered that the Australian silver medallist, Kurt Fearnley, had begun the race in the wrong lane. Following a letter from Fearnley and the Australian authorities to the IPC, which asked that the result not be overturned in the spirit of sportsmanship, the rerun was cancelled and Weir's medal reinstated. Discus thrower Rebecca Chin was originally awarded the silver medal in the women's F37–38, but her classification was challenged and Chin was deemed ineligible for the event, stripped of her medal, and her results were erased. The decision was particularly controversial given that Chin had already been assessed earlier in the Games whilst she competed in the women's F37–38 shot put final.|$|E

30|$|The {{coefficient}} estimate {{associated with}} the dummy variable of whether <b>a</b> respondent <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accident as a driver, however, implies that those that <b>are</b> (<b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accident as drivers) show a tendency towards the safer option in rural roads. This is the opposite effect from the variable of whether <b>a</b> respondent <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> injury accident as a driver for the urban case, and {{can be interpreted as}} being due to the perception of higher speeds in rural roads.|$|R

5|$|The Little Italy {{neighborhood}} grew {{south of}} downtown, as many Italian immigrants {{came to the}} city to work in the Union Pacific shops.

Today the legacy of the city's early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.|$|E
