The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate <b>wave</b> <b>reflection,</b> standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E

Therefore, we determined {{the extent to which}} age alters the impact of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> Aortic stiffness and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> were assessed in 4421 individuals (age range 18 to 92 years). When treated as continuous variables, clinic systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures and glucose levels were independently associated with stiffness, and, with the exception of diastolic pressure, these associations were more marked in older individuals. In contrast, clinic systolic and diastolic pressures and smoking were independently associated with <b>wave</b> <b>reflections,</b> with stronger associations observed in younger individuals. The impact of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> is strongly dependent on age and is largely driven by blood pressure.

Mental stress is a novel risk factor for coronary artery disease and has been associated with left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and sudden cardiac death. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of acute mental stress on aortic {{stiffness and}} <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> Methods: The effect of a mental arithmetic test was assessed in 19 healthy individuals using a randomized, sham-procedure-controlled, crossover design. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were measured as indices of aortic stiffness and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections,</b> respectively. Results: Mental stress induced a sustained increase in central systolic and pulse pressure throughout the whole study (systolic: by 7. 5 mm Hg, p. 05; pulse: by 5. 7 mm Hg, p. 01). The increase in peripheral systolic and pulse pressure was not significant throughout the study, but only when their peak values were compared with baseline (systolic: by 6. 2 mm Hg, peak at 0 minutes; pulse: by 6. 6 mm Hg, peak at 5 minutes, p. 05 for both). There was a sustained increase in pulse wave velocity (by 0. 57 m/s, p. 005) throughout the study denoting a sustained increase in aortic stiffness. Similarly, augmentation index showed a sustained increase with mental stress (by 6. 16 %, p. 05) denoting increased <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> from the periphery. Conclusion: Acute mental stress results in a prolonged increase in aortic stiffness and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> Given the important pathophysiologic and prognostic role of these parameters, our results provide important mechanistic links between acute mental stress and increased cardiovascular risk.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arterial {{stiffness}} is {{an important}} determinant of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The I/D polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between ACE polymorphism, arterial stiffness, and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> in healthy, low-risk population has not been defined yet. METHODS: The study included 282 apparently healthy, low-risk individuals (mean age 39. 7 +/- 8. 9 years, 178 males). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured as an index of aortic stiffness, while <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> were assessed by augmentation index (AIx) of the central pressure waveform. I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined in all subjects for the prevalence of the DD, ID, and II genotype (39, 44, and 17 %, respectively). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined as a marker of chronic, subclinical inflammation. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, presence of D allele was associated with lower values of PWV compared to II genotype (P < 0. 05), implying lower aortic stiffness for D allele carriers. There was no association between ACE genotype and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> or peripheral and central systolic pressures. CONCLUSIONS: In apparently healthy individuals, D allele is associated with lower aortic stiffness, whereas there is no association of the ACE polymorphism with <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> This finding provides {{new insights into the}} possible links between ACE gene, regulation of large artery stiffness, and has implications for cardiovascular risk...|$|R

40|$|In hypertension, {{the blood}} {{pressure}} curve may {{be divided into two}} sets of components. The first set is mean arterial pressure, steady flow, and vascular resistance, thus acting on small arteries; the second set refers to large arteries, hence to pulse pressure, arterial stiffness, and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril not only reduces mean arterial pressure but also acts specifically on pulse pressure. The effect on pulse pressure predominates on central rather than peripheral (brachial) large arteries, reducing aortic stiffness and most <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> Such hemodynamic changes are not observed with standard β-blockade, which reduces aortic stiffness and brachial systolic and pulse pressure but not central pulse pressure and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> In hypertensive subjects, perindopril and other ACE inhibitors seem to predict more consistently the reduction of cardiovascular events, mainly of cardiac origin, than standard β-blockers alone. This effect is associated with the important biochemical finding that mechanotransductions of angiotensin and β-blockade are markedly different, acting in the former specifically on the α 5 β 1 integrin complex and on the fibronectin ligand of arterial vessels...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the influence of (nearly) entire aortic replacement and beta-blocking therapy on blood pressure and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> in Marfan patients. Methods: Four Marfan patients (mean age 31 +/- 3 years) and 8 age matched control subjects were studied. Blood pressure and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> (reflection coefficient and augmentation index) were studied by means of magnetic resonance imaging, continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurements and applanation tonometry. Patients were studied with atenolol, labetalol and without beta-blocking therapy. Results: In Marfan patients, aortic systolic pressure (129 +/- 13 vs 114 +/- 10 mmHg), pulse pressure (58 +/- 13 vs 40 +/- 5 mmHg), wave speed (11 +/- 3 vs 4 +/- 0. 4 in s(- 1)) and reflection coefficient (65 +/- 22 vs 41 +/- 5 %) were significantly increased compared to controls. There was no difference in aortic pressure between various medications in Marfan patients (atenolol 129 / 76 mmHg, labetalol 121 / 75 mmHg and without beta-blocking therapy 129 / 71 mmHg). Higher reflection coefficients were seen in patients with atenolol compared to discontinued medication (73 +/- 18 vs 65 +/- 22 %), and also the augmentation index was higher with atenolol compared to labetalol and discontinued medication (24 +/- 22 vs 17 +/- 17 vs 22 +/- 22 %, respectively). Conclusion: Our results describe increased pulse pressure, systolic pressure, wave speed and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> in four Marfan patients after entire aortic replacement. The use of atenolol or labetalol did not decrease aortic pressure and with atenolol increased <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> were observed. Therefore, the beneficial effect of atenolol in these patients is doubtful. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and women with diabetes have a higher relative-risk of cardiovascular mortality than men. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that {{is associated}} with obesity and confers a particularly high risk of diabetes. There is a need to identify cardiovascular dysfunction in the pre-diabetic stage because, once diabetes is evident, it is difficult to improve the prognosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction are well-established consequences of obesity, but the mechanisms which underpin these findings are not well-defined. Measurements of ventricular-arterial coupling characterise the load which the ventricle must overcome to eject blood. This thesis investigated whether quantitative measures of ventricular-arterial coupling could explain the development of LVH and diastolic dysfunction in young women at risk of diabetes. Two methods of quantifying ventricular-arterial coupling were used (i) a comparison of arterial and ventricular end-systolic elastance, and (ii) the amplitude and timing of <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> in the carotid artery using wave intensity. Increases in elastance were associated with general and central obesity. In contrast, increased <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> were predominantly associated with fat around the organs and with worse metabolic health. Arterial elastance and <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> were independent contributors of left ventricular mass but did not independently contribute to diastolic function. Women with PCOS had similar cardiovascular risk, elastance and diastolic function to matched controls. However, they had a lower odds-ratio of LVH which appeared to be explained by lower amplitude <b>wave</b> <b>reflections.</b> There may be an aspect of PCOS which mitigates the effects of obesity and pre-diabetic states on the pulsatile loading of the left ventricle. The quantification of ventricular-arterial coupling provides new insights to the effects of obesity and pre-diabetic states on sub-clinical cardiovascular disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{clinical}} {{method for}} monitoring cardiac output (CO) should be continuous, minimally invasive, and accurate. However, {{none of the}} conventional CO measurement methods possess all of these characteristics. On the other hand, peripheral arterial blood pressure (ABP) may be measured reliably and continuously {{with little or no}} invasiveness. We have developed a novel technique for continuously monitoring changes in CO by mathematical analysis of a peripheral ABP waveform. In contrast to the previous techniques, our technique analyzes the ABP waveform over time scales greater than a cardiac cycle in which the confounding effects of complex <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> are attenuated. The technique specifically analyzes 6 -min intervals of ABP to estimate the pure exponential pressure decay that would eventually result if pulsatile activity abruptly ceased (i. e., after the high frequency <b>wave</b> <b>reflections</b> vanish). The technique then determines the time constant of this exponential decay, which equals the product of the total peripheral resistance and the nearly constant arterial compliance, and computes proportional CO via Ohm’s law. To validate the technique, we performed six acute swine experiments in which peripheral ABP waveforms and aortic flow probe CO were simultaneously measured over a wide physiologic range. We report an overall CO error of 14. 6 %.
