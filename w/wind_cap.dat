40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the cooling towers of thermal power stations as water coolers. The purpose of the work is to develop the devices improving the efficiency of cooling towers under windy conditions. The author has carried out experimental investigations in a wind tunnel and full-scale tests at existing cooling towers of thermal power stations using modern methods of measurement and control. The author has developed the refined modelling procedure, has performed the investigation of the process of effect of the wind flow on the air ascending current from the cooling tower at two-metre-high large-scale models set inside the natural wind flow and 0, 5 -m high models in a wind tunnel. The author has developed the devices arranged above the upper section of the cooling tower and air duct area improving the cooling tower efficiency under windy conditions. The industrial <b>wind</b> <b>cap</b> has found practical application at cooling tower No. 2 of the Volzhskaya Thermal Power PlantAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

50|$|The season's third {{tropical}} depression developed around 18:00 UTC on June 27 from a tropical wave that crossed Central America four days prior. In {{an environment of}} low shear but abundant dry air and marginal ocean temperatures, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cristina around 12:00 UTC on June 28 before attaining peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) six hours later. The cyclone moved west-northwest and then west as high pressure to its north expanded. Abundant dry air and stronger upper-level <b>winds</b> <b>capped</b> the storm's organization to intermittent, amorphous bursts of convection that eventually dissipated, and Cristina degenerated to a remnant low around 18:00 UTC on June 30. The low turned southward before dissipating on July 3.|$|R
