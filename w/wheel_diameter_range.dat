40|$|This MSc thesis {{belongs to}} a bigger project named ARH- 700 "Basistechnologien für Thermische Strömungsmaschinen". As purpose, this project pretends to lay the {{theoretical}} and experimental foundations of thermal turbomachinery {{in order to have}} a reference point of knowledge and know-how for future investigations on this topic. Despite the huge range of thermal turbomachinery, two restrictions were established as starting point: Output power around 1 kW and high rotational speed. Combining those restrictions plus the fact that compressor wheel velocity should not exceed 500 m/s, optimum <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>range</b> became then similar to automotive turbochargers specifications. Particularly, the contribution of this thesis to the main project is the development of a rotordynamic measurement chain and an analysis interface. Indeed, the reason for building a new measurement chain lays on the need of a faster measurement system for rotordynamic tests to be adapted on a cold-gas test bench (meaning cold, a temperature up to 250 °C). This test bench has already an embedded acquisition system, which is fast enough for thermodynamic purposes but not for rotordynamic tests. Then, the new system should be built and integrated so both systems could work concurrently complementing each other. Aside, both systems should also be able to work independently. The departure point of the thesis starts with the configuration of an acquisition system, adaptation and calibration of sensors, and the implementation of measuring sequences. Also a graphic user interface (GUI) based on Matlab® is developed. This GUI is able to manage the real-time acquisition, data postprocessing and evaluation of the results. Once those points are completed, the measurement is validated by testing a serial production turbocharger. After the validation, rotordynamic analyses are carried out on the ARH- 700 project prototypes. Unfortunately, the manufacturing of the first prototype was delayed and therefore its rotordynamic analysis runs out of this thesis timeframe. However, its adaptation and balancing could be carried out and are included as Appendices. Then, the thesis experimental part is focused on the validation of the measurement chain and on a deep rotordynamic analysis of the automotive turbocharger. Nevertheless, a failure on the turbocharger during a thermodynamical test made impossible to continue the tests. Hence, the experimental part is finally dedicated to compare the rotordynamic response between a fully operational turbocharger and a damaged on, while validating the measurement chain in the process. Simultaneously, some complementary simulations of linear rotordynamics with a simple model are carried out with otordynamikberechnungsprogramm”, calculation software for rotors. This report is structured in five main blocks. Firstly, a summary of the rotordynamic and signal processing theoretical background required for the development of the thesis and the understanding of the analysed data. Secondly, the measurement chain is described in detail stage by stage mentioning all the devices involved. Thirdly, simulations are carried on following a simple rotordynamic model. Fourthly, experimental tests configuration and conduction are explained, as well as the obtained results. Finally, some conclusions are formulated in terms of results comparison and also recommendations to improve the measurement chain for future tests beyond this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{standards}} for the manufacturing inspection of railroad wheels using ultrasound, such as UIC 812, {{have been replaced by}} new standards, for example EN 13262 and RD 32. 144 - 2000, both requiring ultrasonic testing in immersion technique. These new standards require the development of an ultrasonic technique for 100 % coverage of the wheel rim and wheel hub, and in special cases for both straight and curved wheel disks. In order to encompass a large variety of railroad wheel designs, inspection and handling techniques should be capable of dealing with <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>ranging</b> from 600 mm to 1300 mm (23 " to 51 ") at testing cycles from 1 to 4 minutes per wheel. The current requirement for the minimum detectable flaw size is DSR 1 mm (disc shape reflector, DSR, 1 mm diameter) for high-speed train wheels rims and DSR 2 mm for all other wheel rims. The minimum detectable flaw size for all other wheel areas (hub and disk areas) is DSR 3 mm. To meet all these criteria, the Rail Wheel Inspection (RWI) System was developed by IZFP and their partners. The system consists of an ultrasonic testing sub-system, immersion tank and transportation/handling sub-systems. Test cycles of 1 minute per wheel require two immersion tanks and two transportation/handling subsystems. The ultrasonic sub-system features modular computer-aided 6 to 16 - channel UT electronics (PCUS 11) to employ 6 to 16 ultrasonic transducers (the precise number is determined by the testing procedure). This presentation paper offers descriptions of, and results from three of these systems that have been integrated into manufacturing processes at German and Russian wheel manufacturers, and provides details on the following topics: Wheel rim inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 4 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Bochum, Germany) Wheel rim, hub and disc inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 2 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Ilsenburg, Germany) Wheel rim, hub and disc inspection, dual-tank immersion technique, 1 minute inspection cycle per wheel (Nishny-Tagil, Russia...|$|R

A simulation analysis model was built to analyze the influence of <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> difference on safety and stationarity of vehicles on the curved bridge.

40|$|Tyre-road rolling {{resistance}} {{is a major}} factor in the performance of a vehicle. By investigating the {{rolling resistance}}, a better understanding of the efficiency of different <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> will develop. A major issue in the mountain biking world is the relative merits of using 26 in. versus 29 in. wheels and the resultant effect on cyclist performance. As rolling resistance is indicative of the behaviour of a vehicle over specific terrain, it can be viewed as an objective parameter to compare the relative performance of these two wheel sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rolling resistance of four mountain bikes as affected by <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> and terrain type, cyclist mass, tyre inflation pressure and suspension type using coast-down tests. The following major conclusions were drawn: average rolling resistance of the 26 in. <b>diameter</b> <b>wheel</b> was higher than that of the 29 in. diameter wheel; a sand surfacing had the highest rolling resistance coefficient; terrain surface showed the largest effect on rolling resistance coefficients measured, followed by the cyclist mass, <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> and tyre inflation pressure; and the best combination for maintaining momentum after traversing over an obstacle was high tyre inflation pressure, low cyclist mass and full suspension 29 in. <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> option.
