The line-up eventually included Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomers Mike McCready (lead guitar) and Eddie Vedder (background vocals). McCready and Vedder were featured on the album due to their involvement with Ament and Gossard's next project, which became Pearl Jam. [...] The name Temple of the Dog is derived from the opening lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song [...] "Man of Golden Words", [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> like joy inside my heart, seems I been living in the temple of the dog".|$|E

There will be nothing nearly so old as Avebury in it, but there will be {{something}} from almost every chapter that comes after Stonehenge. Rome will be poorly represented, but that may come the day after at Bath. And the next day too I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of our old River Severn. We will come right up to the present if we go through Bristol. There we shall have a whiff of America, our new find, from which the tobacco comes, and we shall be reminded of how we set sail thither--was it yesterday or the day before? You will understand at Bristol how it is that the energy has gone out of this dreaming land--to Africa and America and the whole wide world. It was the good men of Bristol, by the bye, with their trade from Africa to America, who gave you your colour problem. Bristol we may go through to-morrow and Gloucester, mother of I don't know how many American Gloucesters. Bath we'll get in somehow. And then as an Anglo-American showman I shall be tempted to run you northward a little way past Tewkesbury, just to go into a church here and there and show you monuments bearing little shields with the stars and stripes upon them, a few stars and a few stripes, the Washington family monuments." ...|$|E

40|$|Problem 22. 4 points You are the {{contestant}} {{in a game}} show. There {{are four}} closed doors {{at the back of}} the stage. (Note: in the in-class exercise there were only three doors!) Behind one of the doors is a sports car, behind the other three doors are goats. The game master knows which door has the sports car behind it, but you don’t. You have to choose one of the doors; if it is the door with the sports car, the car is yours. After you make your choice, say door A, the game master says: “I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> ” He opens one of the three other doors, let us assume it is door B, and it has a goat behind it. Then the game master asks: “Do you still insist on door A, or do you want to reconsider your choice?...|$|E
