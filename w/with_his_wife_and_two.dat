5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained {{about the size of the}} resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed.

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing could happen to anyone.|$|E
