5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E

40|$|I examine an {{objection}} against autonomy-minded liberalism sometimes made by philosophers such as John Rawls and William Galston, that it rules out <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{which do not}} themselves value freedom or autonomy. This objection is incorrect, because one need not value autonomy {{in order to live}} an autonomous life. Hence autonomy-minded liberalism need not rule out such <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> I suggest a modified objection which does work, namely that autonomy-minded liberalism must rule out <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> that could not develop under an autonomy-promoting education. I conclude by suggesting some reasons why autonomy-minded liberals should bite the bullet and accept this...|$|R

5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.

5|$|Another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
