The grand opening of the atrium and stores was held on February 14, 1983, with the apartments and offices following shortly thereafter. The forty ground floor stores in the tower were opened for business on November 30, 1983. At the building's dedication, Mayor Koch said, [...] "This is not your low-income housing project [...] of which we need many.

500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea out that we are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E

2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to {{know what}} the actual {{shortest}} path is. To do this, we use another array p, a predecessor array. This array implicitly stores the path to any square s by storing the previous node on the shortest path to s, i.e. the predecessor. To reconstruct the path, we lookup the predecessor of s, then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on, until we reach the starting square. Consider the following code: ...|$|E

[...] When H is nonplanar, <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to consider k-clique-sums of a list of graphs, {{each of which is}} embedded on a surface. The following example with H=K5 illustrates this point. The graph K5 embeds on every surface except for the sphere. [...] However there exist K5-free graphs that are far from planar. [...] In particular, the 3-clique-sum of any list of planar graphs results in a K5-free graph.

[...] Huckabee added that <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to address [...] "the infanticide in our own country, with the slaughter of millions of unborn children." [...] Paul opposed even sending food, and added, [...] "we should direct our attention only to national security, and not get involved for these feel-good reasons of going overseas for the various reasons, and this is the main reason why I think we ought to just come home from every place in the coun-, from every place in the world." [...] Keyes replied, [...] "I have to say I'm appalled by the suggestion that we retreat into some kind of Fortress America, and forget who we are. [...] We are a nation of nations, a people of many peoples. [...] We are in touch with every people on the face of the earth. [...] If somebody's is being hurt somewhere in the world, somebody in America grieves for them. [...] And I don't believe we can turn our backs on that universal significance, that universal mission... We don't have to send troops, but we need to support and reinforce the sense of local regional responsibility for both humanitarian and military order in that region." ...|$|E
