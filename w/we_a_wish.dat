The principal elements of a VLBI station are the antenna, a phase stable receiver and IF system, a stable frequency standard, usually a hydrogen maser, and a backend for recording the IF (Figure 1). We consider each of these in Sections 2 through 5. We also discuss procedures for the setup and execution of a VLBI experiment at Hat Creek in Sections 6 through 8. Finally, <b>we</b> give <b>a</b> <b>wish</b> list for improvements and technical innovations in Section 9. 2. The Antenna We maximize the collecting area of our station by phasing together the signal {{from more than one}} antenna. Ideally, we would sum together the signals from each antenna; however, this is not always possible. In fact, for the measurement of phasing efficiency, we always exclude at least one antenna. To phase the array, <b>we</b> observe <b>a</b> source for a few minutes prior to the VLBI scan. We then self-calibrate the phases and apply the solutions to the phase offsets for LO 1.

Thus, the notion of stage is discontinuous, having the same transitional gaps as the orders of hierarchical complexity. This is in accordance with previous definitions.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{two-dimensional}} materials have attracted incredible interest from the electronic device community. The first two-dimensional material studied in detail was graphene and, since 2007, it has intensively been explored as a material for electronic devices, in particular, transistors. While graphene transistors {{are still on}} the agenda, researchers have extended their work to two-dimensional materials beyond graphene and the number of two-dimensional materials under examination has literally exploded recently. Meanwhile several hundreds of different two-dimensional materials are known, a substantial part of them is considered useful for transistors, and experimental transistors with channels of different two-dimensional materials have been demonstrated. In spite of the rapid progress in the field, the prospects of two-dimensional transistors still remain vague and optimistic opinions face rather reserved assessments. The intention of the present paper is to shed more light on the merits and drawbacks of two-dimensional materials for transistor electronics and to add a few more facets to the ongoing discussion on the prospects of two-dimensional transistors.
