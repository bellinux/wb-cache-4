Even... the 100,000 dead will only have been the final decoy that Saddam will have sacrificed, the blood money paid in forfeit according to a calculated equivalence, {{in order to preserve}} his power. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> is that these dead still serve as an alibi {{for those who do not}} want to have been excited for nothing: at least these dead will prove this war was indeed a war and not a shameful and pointless hoax...|$|E

"one {{part that}} we do know thus far is that the U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), granted {{millions}} of dollars to the Poland-America-Ukraine Cooperation Initiative (PAUCI), which is administered by the U.S.-based Freedom House. PAUCI then sent U.S. Government funds to numerous Ukrainian non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This would be bad enough and would in itself constitute meddling {{in the internal affairs of}} a sovereign nation. But, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> is that many of these grantee organizations in Ukraine are blatantly in favor of presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{refer to}} the ‘conga,’ that strident group of drums, frying pans and shrieks, to whose sounds epileptic, ragged, semi-nude crowds run about the streets of our metropolis, and who, between lubricous contortions and abrupt movements, show a lack of respect to society, offend morality, {{discredit}} our customs, lower us {{in the eyes of}} people from other countries and, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse,</b> by their example, contaminate schoolchildren, who I have seen carried away by the heat of the lesson, panting and sweaty, engaging in frenetic competitions in corporal flexibility in those shameful tourneys of licentiousness.” (Pérez I 1988:337) ...|$|E

2500|$|... – Turkey has {{signaled}} to the coup negatively and used statements, diplomatic channels and financial measures. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said: [...] "No {{matter where they}} are...coups are bad. Coups are clearly enemies of democracy. Those who rely on the guns in their hands, those who rely {{on the power of}} the media cannot build democracy...Democracy can only be built at ballot box." [...] He also criticised the West for not terming the actions as a coup, while praising the African Union's decision to suspend Egypt over the coup. [...] "The West has failed the sincerity test. No offence, but democracy does not accept double standards." [...] Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in a televised statement that [...] "The toppling of a government that came into office through democratic elections, through methods that are not legal – and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse,</b> through a military coup – is unacceptable, no matter what the reasons". Hüseyin Çelik, a spokesman for the governing Justice and Development Party and former cabinet member in the Erdoğan administration, condemned the ouster as a sign of [...] "backwardness" [...] and accused unnamed Western countries of supporting Morsi's overthrow. [...] "Some Western countries have not accepted Muslim Brotherhood's rise to power. They have mobilized the streets, then issued a memorandum, and are now staging the coup." [...] He also advised Morsi's supporters to avoid bloodshed in response.|$|E

60|$|Gillian chafed inwardly, {{but she was}} {{beginning}} to learn that Aunt Ada was more impenetrable than Aunt Jane, and, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse,</b> Aunt Jane always stood by her sister's decision, whether she would have herself originated it or not.|$|R

60|$|If Seth Warner {{failed in}} his purpose, {{it would be}} owing in a certain degree to <b>what</b> had <b>been</b> told these men, and Isaac, who had hoped to win renown, if not glory, by enlisting, could charge himself with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> than a blunder.|$|R
6000|$|She {{also had}} a {{twilight}} tinge of [...] "Blue," [...] Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote, [...] Made epigrams occasionally too [...] Upon her friends, as everybody ought.

60|$|The {{idea was}} ingenious, but hopeless from the start. The whistle {{at the end}} of the garden became {{piercing}} in its endeavour to attract attention, and, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse,</b> developed an odd note of entreaty. Mr. Chalk, pale with apprehension, could bear no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Niece, you're a gander; and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse,</b> a very silly gander. What is Mr Moffat's {{family to}} you and me? Mr Moffat has that which ranks above family honours. He is a very rich man." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse,</b> Lady Conway had paired {{them off}} {{in the order of}} precedence; and Louis was a victim to two dowagers, between whom he could neither see nor speak to Mary.

60|$|M. de La Tour d'Azyr's friends looked grave, perturbed.

6000|$|But the {{fluttering}} {{approach of}} such an hypothesis was dispersed by the recollection that Margaret had actually departed, and (<b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse)</b> had gone off with [...] "his friend, Mr. Lithgow."

50|$|During the Japanese {{asset price}} bubble of the late 1980s Japanese banks, {{including}} DKB, granted increasingly risky loans. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse,</b> DKB financed not only risky companies but also Yakuza, crime organizations, in order to invest in capital resources much more easily than its competitors.

60|$|A stroll homeward {{through the}} Park after lunch brought no further {{enlightenment}} {{on the subject}} that was uppermost in her mind; <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse,</b> it brought her, without possibility of escape, within hailing distance of Merla Blathington, who fastened on to her with the enthusiasm of a lonely tsetse fly encountering an outpost of civilisation.|$|R

60|$|Evan {{looked very}} {{doubtful}} {{and offered a}} somewhat wavering weapon; but he was quickly brought back to his senses by his opponent's sword-point, which shot past him, shaving his shoulder by a hair.
