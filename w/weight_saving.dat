Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's <b>weight,</b> <b>saving</b> energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E

40|$|The {{external}} tank (ET) {{has been}} {{actively involved in}} performance improvements {{since the inception of}} the space shuttle program, primarily by <b>weight</b> <b>savings.</b> <b>Weight</b> <b>savings</b> were realized on the first block of flight articles (standard weight tank). With a need for further performance improvements, the ET Program Office was requested to develop a program to reduce tank weight an additional 6000 lb and schedule delivery of the first lightweight ET (LWT) for June 1982. The <b>weight</b> <b>savings</b> program was accomplished by: (1) a unique approach to use of factors of safety; (2) design optimization; and (3) redesign of structures with large margins of safety which resulted in an actual <b>weight</b> <b>savings</b> of 7294 lb. Additional studies have identified further <b>weight</b> <b>savings</b> which are to be implemented at appropriate times in production flow. Examples are an improved thermal protection system for the LH 2 tank aft dome and reduction of slosh baffles in the LO 2 tank based on flight data. All performance improvements were compared and selected based on non-recurring and recurring cost and technical risk...|$|R

The special edition, motorsport-inspired V8 Vantage N420 came with Sports Pack suspension as standard, a new sports exhaust system and plenty of carbon fibre which achieved a 27kg <b>weight</b> <b>saving</b> over the standard car. In addition, the N420 has some distinctive Aston Martin ‘Race Collection’ paint schemes available as an option although any other colour could be specified. In addition, the N420 has the extended N400 sills, carbonfibre splitter, side strakes and diffuser plus 10-spoke diamond turned alloy wheels with gloss black finish, black mesh vents and ‘Graphitic’ tailpipe finishers.|$|E

500|$|However, the Bureau of Ordnance {{continued}} {{working on}} a larger barbette design, while the Bureau of Construction and Repair utilized the smaller barbettes in the final planning of the new battleships. As the bureaus were independent of one another, they {{did not realize that}} the two plans could not go together until November 1938, when the design was {{in the final stages of}} refinement. By this time, the ships could not use the larger barbette, as it would require extensive alterations to the design and would result in substantial weight penalties. The General Board was astounded; one member asked the head of the Bureau of Ordnance if it had occurred to him that Construction and Repair would have wanted to know what turret his subordinates were working on [...] "as a matter of common sense". A complete scrapping of plans was avoided only when designers within the Bureau of Ordnance were able to design a new 50-caliber gun, the Mark 7, that was both lighter and smaller in outside diameter; this allowed it to be placed in a turret that would fit in the smaller barbette. The redesigned 3-gun turret, equipped as it was with the Mark 7 naval gun, provided an overall <b>weight</b> <b>saving</b> of nearly [...] to the overall design of the Iowa class.|$|E

50|$|The {{advent of}} 700 billet {{aluminum}} meant that components {{no longer had}} to be made of stainless steel in order to be both strong and light. This aluminum, while more expensive, allowed for a significant <b>weight</b> <b>savings</b> in most components of the marker. The X-Valve is functionally identical to the ReTro Valve, but is made of aluminum instead of stainless steel. This results in an approximately 50% <b>weight</b> <b>savings</b> for no loss in durability or performance. The same concept was applied to the mainbodies, and the result was UltraLight Engineering (ULE). In addition to the <b>weight</b> <b>savings,</b> aluminum could be anodized instead of painted, allowing for more impressive colors and designs. The end result is a much lighter marker than any in the previous generations; indeed, Automags are some of the lightest markers available today. The lighter components also yielded some minor performance increases; the X-Valve has been unofficially tested to perform in excess of 30 BPS with no shootdown.|$|R
