5|$|The film's scathingly bad {{reviews and}} poor word-of-mouth {{led to a}} precipitous falling-off in its grosses. Having earned $11,548,898 from 3,307 screens on its opening weekend, its take {{collapsed}} by 67 percent to $3,924,921 the following weekend, giving an average take of $1,158 per screen. The film made 85 percent of its entire domestic gross in its first 10 days and flatlined thereafter, with earnings dropping a further 75 percent {{by the end of}} its third week to $1million. The following week, facing earnings of just $205,745, Warner Bros. attempted to cut its losses by slashing the number of screens at which the film was being shown. The number was reduced from 2,587 to 641. By its sixth <b>weekend</b> <b>on</b> release, the film was showing on 95screens and had made $18,993 in a week – less than $200 per screen.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} film to open during Super Bowl weekend is the 2008 concert film , which took in $31.1 million, {{almost half the}} total it would earn during a released limited to just that weekend and the following week. In a close second is Dear John, grossing $30.5 million in 2010, for the strongest Super Bowl weekend opening for a conventional release. Both films had strong appeal to female moviegoers, an audience more receptive to moviegoing on a weekend dominated by a sporting event. The 2008 action film Taken, which Cargill noted for its success in appealing to an older audience, took in $24.7 million on its opening <b>weekend</b> <b>on</b> its way to total receipts of over $100 million, making it a distant third.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Ella {{intensified}} {{quickly and}} reached hurricane status late on August31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight. At the time, the hurricane was forecast {{to avoid making}} landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward, although it was expected to pass within 50miles (85km) of land during the busy Labor Day <b>Weekend.</b> <b>On</b> September1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a major hurricane and a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At {{the same time a}} short-wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States. The trough caused the hurricane to decelerate and turn slightly to the north, and a ridge behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24hours.

5|$|With the Portland match being postponed, it {{resulted}} in a three-week span of no competitive play for D.C. United.

In addition to his career game, Davis set a New Orleans' franchise record with six straight games of at least 28 points. Glen Rice set the previous best stretch with five straight in the 1990s.
