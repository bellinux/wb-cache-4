40|$|ResumoConsiderando que o pensamento de Jon Elster se dirige às falhas da racionalidade e à irracionalidade, o mote norteador deste trabalho será a compreensão da “teoria da escolha racional” em algumas de suas obras, como, por exemplo, em Ulises y las Sirenas: Estudios sobre Racionalidad e Irracionalidad e também em seu texto Ulysses Unbound: Studies in Rationality, precommitment, and Constraints. Mostrar-se-á que o autor se vale do mito de Ulisses para explicar o como e o por quê o indivíduo, mesmo ciente do que seria racional em sua escolha previamente analisada, pode sentir-se tentado a agir guiado por suas emoções. Pretende-se destacar a analogia feita por Elster entre a estratégia utilizada por Ulisses e o processo constitucional, para constatar em que medida a atitude de atar-se a si mesmo pode ser considerada um mecanismo de limitação e proteção contra os interesses e paixões, tanto dos constituintes como também de seus eleitores. Palavras-chaveConstituição; compromisso prévio; paixões; racionalidade imperfeita. AbstractWhereas {{the thought}} of Jon Elster {{addresses}} the failures of rationality and irrationality, the guiding theme of this work is the understanding of ";rational choice theory"; {{in some of his}} works, for example, Ulises y las Sirenas: Estudios about rationality and irrationality, and also in your text Ulysses Unbound: Studies in rationality, precommitment, and Constraints. Show up-to which the author relies on the myth of Ulysses to explain how and why the individual even aware of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rational in <b>your</b> choice previously discussed, may be tempted to act guided by their emotions. It is intended to highlight the analogy made ​​by Elster between the strategy used by Ulysses and the constitutional process, to observe to what extent the attitude of knotting himself can be considered a limiting mechanism and protection of the interests and passions of both constituents as well as their constituents.

Figure to yourself, Mr. Speaker, the land in whose representative chair you sit; figure to yourself the form and fashion of your sweet and cheerful country from Thames to Trent, north and south, and from the Irish to the German Sea, east and west, emptied and embowelled (may God avert the omen of our crimes!) by so accomplished a desolation. Extend your imagination a little further, and then suppose your ministers taking a survey of this scene of waste and desolation. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> thoughts, if you should be informed that they were computing how much had been {{the amount of the}} excises, how much the customs, how much the land and malt tax, in order that they should charge (take it in the most favorable light) for public service, upon the relics of the satiated vengeance of relentless enemies, the whole of what England had yielded in the most exuberant seasons of peace and abundance? What would you call it? To call it tyranny sublimed into madness would be too faint an image; yet this very madness is the principle upon which the ministers at your right hand have proceeded in their estimate of the revenues of the Carnatic, when they were providing, not supply for the establishments of its protection, but rewards for the authors of its ruin.|$|E
60|$|Almost {{by the end}} of March it was too {{probable}} that no road of retreat was any longer open. If they could cut no way out, either by land or water, what form of relief was possible? A diversion from Suakin to Berber—one of Gordon’s own suggestions? But the soldiers differed. Fierce summer heat and little water; an Indian force might stand it; even they would find it tough. A dash by a thousand cavalry across two hundred miles of desert—one hundred of them without water; without communication with its base, and with the certainty that whatever might befall, no reinforcements could reach it for months? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> feelings, and your language, asked Lord (M64) Hartington, if besides having Gordon and Stewart beleaguered in Khartoum, we also knew that a small force of British cavalry unable to take the offensive was shut up in the town of Berber?(104) Then the government wondered whether a move on Dongola might not be advantageous. Here again the soldiers thought the torrid climate a fatal objection, and the benefits doubtful. Could not Gordon, some have asked, have made his retreat at an early date after reaching Khartoum, by way of Berber? Answer—the Nile was too low. All this it was that at a later day, when {{the time had come to}} call his government to its account, justified Mr. Gladstone in saying that in such enterprises as these in the Soudan, mistakes and miscarriages were inevitable, for they were the proper and certain consequences of undertakings that lie beyond the scope of human means and of rational and prudent human action, and are a war against nature.(105) If anybody now points to the victorious expedition to Khartoum thirteen years later, as falsifying such language as this, that experience so far from falsifying entirely justifies. A war against nature demands years of study, observation, preparation, and those who are best acquainted with the conditions at first hand all agree that neither the tribes nor the river nor the desert were well known enough in 1885, to guarantee that overthrow in the case of the Mahdi, which long afterwards destroyed his successor.|$|E

40|$|What {{makes for}} a good life? If you have a child, a spouse, or a very close friend you {{probably}} want {{what is best for}} her. However, in order to know <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best for <b>your</b> loved one you need an account of the personal good. I argue for a version of value pluralism, according to which there is disparate list of fundamental goods which resist reduction to some single supervalue such as pleasure and lack any strong unifying principle. I argue that any adequate account of the human good must include pleasure and freedom from pain, knowledge and understanding, practical rationality, and proper emotional responsiveness as fundamental goods, and that the only thing these various goods have in common is their intrinsic goodness. Value pluralism is an alternative to various kinds of monism about the good, such as hedonism, perfectionism, and the desire-satisfaction theory. Hedonism explains the value of any putative good in terms of pleasure, while perfectionism sees the good in terms of the development and exercise of those capacities or characteristics essential to some aspect of our nature. Desire- satisfaction views are best considered a form of monism about the good, since their identification of one's good with the satisfaction of one's desires offers a way of unifying various goods. The battle between monistic and pluralistic accounts is usefully analyzed in terms of competing theoretical virtues such as unity, simplicity, explanatory coherence, and plausibility. Monistic accounts typically score high along the first three of these dimensions and quite low along the last. I consider what I take to be the most promising versions of value monism, and argue that each scores so low along the dimension of plausibility that it should be rejected in favor of value pluralism. I begin by considering hedonism and the desire- satisfaction view and then discuss two distinct versions of perfectionism. Hedonism and perfectionism, in particular, are implausible because they fail to recognize our complex natures as embodied rational agents, and our need for a vision of the good which is correspondingly complex.
