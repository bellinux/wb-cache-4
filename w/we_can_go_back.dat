500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> again and now do it nationwide-style".|$|E

Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. Once we get a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the powers that be and see if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the grid. I think we will pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world and what does that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{battle for}} the 1st Marine Division would be the bloodiest yet at the Battle of Peleliu. They landed on 15 September 1944 {{as part of the}} III Amphibious Corps assault on the island. The division's {{commanding}} general, Major General William H. Rupertus had predicted the fighting would be, [...] "...tough but short. It'll be over in three or four days – a fight like Tarawa. Rough but fast. Then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to a rest area." [...] Making a mockery of the prediction, {{the first week of the}} battle alone cost the division 3,946 casualties, during which time they secured the key airfield sites. [...] The division fought on Peleliu for one month before being relieved. [...] Some of the heaviest fighting of the entire war took place in places such as Bloody Nose Ridge and the central ridges of the island that made up the Umurbrogol Pocket. [...] The month of fighting against the 14th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) on Peleliu cost the 1st Marine Division 1,252 dead and 5,274 wounded.|$|E

In the present case, since {{it is unlikely that}} we will ever have full data on the Cochimi language, we may never know what the original Cochimi meaning of the word "Cahuilla" may have been. But I believe we may accept the data assembled by Harrington as showing that—unlike other tribal names such as Serrano or Luiseno—the term "Cahuilla" did have an Indian origin, and that it was used by Spanish speakers in Baja California to mean "a non-missionized Indian. " In that sense, it was apparently applied to the Southern California tribe that we call the Cahuilla today...|$|R

5000|$|Some of Theory's {{achievements}} are {{genuine and}} permanent additions to knowledge, or intellectual self-knowledge. Eagleton is quite right {{to assert that}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{to a state of}} pre-Theory innocence about the transparency of language or the ideological neutrality of interpretation ... But like all fashions it was bound to have a limited life of novelty and vitality, and we are now living through its decadence without any clear indication of what will supersede it. Theory has, in short, become boringly predictable to many people who were once enthusiastic about it, and that After Theory is most interesting when its focus is furthest from its nominal subject is perhaps evidence that Terry Eagleton is now bored by it too.|$|R

Although Welch wrote 24 more articles for the Appendixes {{related to the}} Acts 28 position, {{this was the only}} article published.

Their response was: [...] "We do not know what Dr. Bullinger would have written, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and adopt what he has already written, although his last book, The Foundations of Dispensational Truth proves that he fully accepted Acts 28 as the dispensational boundary and the segregation of The Prison Epistles." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Michelle Lulic of Bustle, [...] "the song's lyrics {{seem to be}} {{alluding}} to a relationship that was definitely strong at one point, but now not so much." [...] In the pre-chorus, he warns: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never <b>go</b> <b>back</b> / Thought you'd like to know that," [...] before singing in the chorus: [...] "He, won't touch you like I do /He, won't love you like I would /He don't know your body /He don't do you right /He won't love you like I would." [...] As noted by Lulic, in the chorus, [...] "he is trying to prove to someone {{that he is the}} best thing she is ever going to get." [...] She also suggested that the song could have been inspired by his break-up with former fiancée Perrie Edwards, due to the pleading tone in his voice.|$|R
40|$|This article argues that, propaedeutic to the {{construction}} of an Objectivist aesthetics, scholars must refute the irrational/immoral philosophical premises that have been destroying the philosophy of art. Due to the troubling combination of its contemporaneity, extremism, and considerable influence, poststructuralism, which, since the 1960 s, has served as the default philosophical foundation for philosophers of art, is the target of this article. This article contends that the road to an Objectivist aesthetics must first be cleared of philosophical debris like poststructuralism before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hope to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the world of art...|$|R

50|$|As {{a simple}} {{application}} of the above, consider the plane, parametrised by polar coordinates (R, θ). <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to a new coordinate system (cartesian coordinates) by defining functions x(R, θ) = R cos(θ) and y(R, θ) = R sin(θ). This makes it possible given any point (R, θ) to find corresponding cartesian coordinates (x, y). When <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and convert cartesian into polar coordinates? By the previous example, it is sufficient to have det J ≠ 0, with Since det J = R, conversion back to polar coordinates is possible if R ≠ 0. So it remains to check the case R = 0. It {{is easy to see}} that in case R = 0, our coordinate transformation is not invertible: at the origin, the value of θ is not well-defined.|$|R

The history starts in 1796 when the entire province was claimed by Don Angel de Miranda in search of a new settlement. They cleared out a part of the woods and made the area suitable for farming. In 1899, when the American forces arrived, the inhabitants of Pandan were among the Filipino soldiers who defended Angeles City, a battle which lasted three whole months. Despite the battle between the Filipinos and Americans during the latter’s first arrival, these men fought side by side during the second World War.|$|R
40|$|Photonic dicers {{bring the}} light {{everywhere}} on a chip and light gets reformatted. This is indeed what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{do with the}} laser writing technique developed by D. MacLachlan and co-workers, enabling to build optical waveguides of any size and connect them in a 3 D space. In other words <b>we</b> <b>can</b> bring the light wherever we want across a photonic chip. An example? <b>We</b> <b>can</b> take the light out of a large multimode waveguide and dice it in a 3 D array of stacked single mode waveguides; then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> deliver the waveguides through the photonic chip or even rearrange all the light-paths in a diffraction limited pseudo-slit waveguide. And if <b>we</b> like, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> also <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to a multimode waveguide, and so forth. Well beyond the well-known concept of a photonic lantern, here optical modes can be reformatted arbitrarily and many times, because every waveguide transition is adiabatic and low loss.

40|$|What do {{we mean by}} {{neutrino}} astronomy? Which {{information is}} it able to provide us and which is its potential? To address these questions, we discuss three among the most relevant sources of neutrinos: the Sun; the core collapse supernovae; the supernova remnants. For each of these astronomical objects, we describe {{the state of the}} art, we present the expectations and we outline the most actual problems {{from the point of view}} of neutrino astronomy. The discovery of the world of elementary particles (including cosmic rays, gravitons, neutrinos) and the growing interest in astrophysical processes has opened the way to new astronomies, collectively named particle astronomies. In the case of neutrino astronomy, awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002, the progress was unavoidably related to the solution of the neutrino puzzles, i. e., the solar neutrino problem and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly, which pointed out non-standard neutrino properties. Today, half a century after the deep theoretical insights of B. Pontecorvo and the pioneristic detection of neutrinos from natural sources by the Homestake, KGF and CWI experiments, we know a lot about these particles. <b>We</b> <b>can,</b> thus, <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the original program and use neutrinos to probe the inner parts of the stars, the processes of cosmic ray acceleration, the primordial Universe...|$|R

If the above narrative and analysis are in line with the historical facts, the Han nationality, which has been strengthened by its agricultural advantages, must first encounter the challenge of changing its economic structure. The areas in which they live are areas suitable for agriculture. The raw materials needed for industry in these areas are relatively poor. It is the regions that in the past were unattractive to the Han, and thus have been home to many ethnic minorities, that raw materials are most plentiful. At the same time, industrial development requires technological and cultural knowledge, and ethnic minorities tend to have relatively lower levels of formal education and training than the Han. It is difficult for ethnic minorities to use their own resources to develop their industries in these regions. How will these specific circumstances affect the national structure? [...]...|$|R
