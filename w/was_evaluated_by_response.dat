Materials and methods: In this study, the potential of β-glucanase production by B. subtilis B 5 d was confirmed using qualitative method. The B. subtilis B 5 d isolate was identified through biochemical and molecular methods. Determination of optimum condition for beta glucanase activity <b>was</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>response</b> surface method and Central Composite Design. Investigated variables included temperature (20 - 80 °C), pH (3. 5 - 8) and concentration of substrate (0. 1 - 1 %). Results: According to the molecular and biochemical analysis, the strain B. subtilis B 5 d belonges to B. subtilis species. Based on the Central Composite Design results, the quadratic model was the most suitable model for predicting β-glucanase activity in experimental temperature, pH and substrate concentration range. Furthermore, the optimization of enzyme activity showed that the β-glucanase produced by strain B 5 d has highest catalytic activity at pH (5. 5 - 7) and temperature (50 - 65 °C) and the high concentration of lechinan. However, the enzyme activity is reduced in 80 and 20 °C as well as low concentration of substrate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is an {{exceedingly}} rare and orphan disease, without active drugs approved {{in the front}} line. Pazopanib and trabectedin are licensed for sarcoma treatment from second-line, but very little and contradictory data are available on their activity in ASPS. Lacking ongoing and/or planned clinical trials, we conducted a multi-institutional study involving the reference sites for sarcoma in Europe, U. S., and Japan, within the World Sarcoma Network, to investigate the efficacy of pazopanib and trabectedin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2007, 14 of the 27 centers that were asked to retrospectively review their databases had identified 44 advanced ASPS patients treated with pazopanib and/or trabectedin. Response <b>was</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>Response</b> Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1. 1. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were computed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Among 30 patients who received pazopanib, 18 were pretreated (13 with other antiangiogenics). Response was evaluable in 29 / 30 patients. Best responses were 1 complete response, 7 partial response (PR), 17 stable disease (SD), and 4 progressions. At a 19 -month median follow-up, median PFS was 13. 6 months (range: 1. 6 - 32. 2 +), with 59 % of patients progression-free at 1 year. Median OS was not reached. Among 23 patients treated with trabectedin, all were pretreated and evaluable for response. Best responses were 1 PR, 13 SD, and 9 progressions. At a 27 -month median follow-up, median PFS was 3. 7 months (range: 0. 7 - 109), with 13 % of patients progression-free at 1 year. Median OS was 9. 1 months. CONCLUSION: The value of pazopanib in advanced ASPS is confirmed, with durable responses, whereas the value of trabectedin appears limited. These results are relevant to defining the best approach to advanced ASPS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This retrospective study, conducted among the world reference centers for treatment of sarcoma, confirms the value of pazopanib in patients with advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), with dimensional and durable responses, whereas trabectedin shows a limited activity. Alveolar soft part sarcoma is resistant to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The most important independent variable of extrusion was temperature, followed by moisture. These two parameters significantlyaffected technological and nutritive properties of cowpea seed flour. Results indicated that process temperature linearly and quadratically affected expansion ratio, texture, and bulk density products. Feed moisture quadratically affected expansion ratio. Extrudates that would have suitable texture for snack products were produced at 23 % initial moisture content and 1500 C processing temperature. Products extruded under these conditions had the greater radial expansion and lower texture. Total protein content of the raw material was widely preserved after the extrusion process. With increasing severity of heat treatment, some products presented an invitro digestibility decreased, and a more pronounced loss of available lysine. A decrease in the processing temperature and an increase in the raw material water content, during extrusion, appears as the best practical way to improve both technological and nutritive properties of the product...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe median {{survival}} in glioblastoma is {{just over a}} year, with no standard second-line therapy. Ipilimumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that activates the anti-tumour immune <b>response</b> <b>by</b> cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen- 4 blockade. There is significant evidence supporting {{its role in the}} treatment of malignant melanoma, including in patients with brain metastases. The addition of the anti-angiogenesis agent, bevacizumab, seems to offer additional benefit and limit the immune-related side-effects of ipilimumab in melanoma. To date there have been no clinical trials investigating this combination in glioblastoma. In this single practice case series, 20 patients with glioblastoma were consented for and treated with ipilimumab and bevacizumab in combination. Safety, tolerability and the response to treatment were reviewed for all patients. Three patients were treated after palliative first-line radiotherapy, one patient after first-line chemoradiation and 16 patients were treated with recurrent disease. Sixty-five per cent of patients completed four cycles of 3 weekly ipilimumab therapy, administered with 2 weekly bevacizumab. Radiographic responses for patients with recurrent disease <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>Response</b> Assessment in Neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria; 31 % of patients showed a partial response, 31 % had stable disease and 38 % had disease progression. The treatment combination was well tolerated, with treatment terminated before completion due to adverse events in two patients. Autoimmune toxicity was manageable with systemic corticosteroid therapy. Ipilimumab and bevacizumab in combination show promising activity with a predictable and manageable toxicity profile, warranting further clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of application of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) in breadmaking, {{through the development of}} ideal formulation, with combinations of additives and enzyme, and the evaluation of the effect of the enzyme on proteins. To verify the enzyme effects, three formulations were tested: Base formulation, characterized by the absence of enzyme and emulsifying agents (bread Zero); Control formulation, comprised by the presence of emulsifying agents and ascorbic acid (bread Control), and the formulation prepared with the Base formulation and enzyme (bread MTGase). Protein fractions of gliadins, glutenin and waste extraction were obtained from samples of flour, dough and bread. The gliadins and glutenin were analyzed by RP-HPLC (reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography). The best formulation was obtained using a experimental design, with variations in the concentrations of emulsifying agents, ascorbic acid and enzyme. The results <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>response</b> surface methodology, which values are 0. 6 % of transglutaminase, 0. 2 % of emulsifying agent and 70 ppm of ascorbic acid. The analysis of gliadins fractions showed about 3 % protein, dry basis, and glutenins fractions were between 2 and 5 % protein. The results indicated that the enzyme modified chemical and functional properties of glutenins fraction, improving dough strength and bread volume. Results of total nitrogen content, and chromatographic profiles of the protein fractions suggest that while glutenins proteins were modified by enzyme, gliadins proteins were not affected...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of xylanase from palm kernel cake {{as a substrate}} was studied in solid substrate fermentation. The simultaneous effects of three independent variables, namely incubation temperature, initial moisture content of substrate and air flow rate on xylanase production <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>response</b> surface methodology using central composite face centered design. A total of 18 experiments were carried out in which Aspergillus niger FTCC 5003 was cultivated on palm kernel cake in a column bioreactor for 7 days under incubation temperature, moisture level and aeration rate determined. Test {{results showed that the}} highest xylanase activity of 174. 88 U g - 1 was produced at incubation temperature, initial moisture level and aeration rate of 25 °C, 60 % and 1. 5 L min - 1, respectively. The statistical analysis of the experimental results revealed that the linear effect of incubation temperature and quadratic term of initial moisture content had highly significant effects on xylanase production (p< 0. 01). Statistical results also showed that interaction effect between incubation temperature and initial moisture content as well as interaction effect between moisture level and aeration rate influenced the yield of xylanase at probability levels of 95 %. Optimum conditions determined by statistical model for attaining maximum xylanase production were incubation temperature of 25 °C, initial moisture level of 63 % and aeration rate of 1. 76 L min - 1. The xylanase activity of 192. 50 U g - 1 was obtained when solid substrate fermentation was performed under the optimal circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Taguchi {{method is}} {{regarded}} as a powerful tool to design optimization for quality. In this study, it was used to find the optimal cutting parameters for precision-drilling operations. The cutting parameters include guiding drilling, spindle speed, feed rate, stepping amount, number of steps and cutting fluid. The considered characteristics of performance are tool life, and the variation of drilled hole-diameter. Taguchi Method and Orthogonal Array were applied to the experiments of precision-drilling so as to allocate the corresponding processing parameters. The obtained results <b>were</b> then <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>Response</b> Table, Response Chart, and Analysis of Variance methods (ANOVA) to acquire the optimal processing parameters. These were further confirmed by experiment. Finally, the analysis of the precision-drilling process applied for mold steel SKD 61 shows that this approach can greatly improve the drilling performance of a small-drilling process...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe {{potential}} to accurately quantify {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) mutations in plasma from non–small-cell lung cancer patients would enable more rapid and more frequent analyses to assess disease status; however, the utility of such analyses for clinical purposes has only recently started to explore. MethodsPlasma samples were obtained from 69 patients with EGFR-mutated tumors and 21 negative control cases. EGFR mutations in plasma were analyzed by a standardized allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and ultra-deep next-generation sequencing (NGS). A semiquantitative index (SQI) was derived from dilutions of known EGFR mutation copy numbers. Clinical <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>Response</b> Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1. 1 criteria and expressed as percent tumor shrinkage. ResultsThe sensitivity and specificity of the PCR test and NGS assay in plasma versus tissue were 72 % versus 100 % and 74 % versus 100 %, respectively. Quantitative indices by the PCR test and NGS were significantly correlated (p < 0. 001). EGFR testing at baseline and serially at 4 to 60 days during tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy revealed a progressive decrease in SQI, starting from day 4, in 95 % of cases. The rate of SQI decrease correlated with percent tumor shrinkage at 2 months (p < 0. 0001); at 14 days, {{it was more than}} 50 % in 70 % of patients (rapid responders). In two patients with slow response, an early increase in the circulating levels of the T 790 M mutation was observed. No early T 790 M mutations were seen in plasma samples of rapid responders. ConclusionsQuantification of EGFR mutations from plasma with a standardized PCR test is feasible. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a strong correlation between the EGFR SQI in the first days of treatment and clinical response with relevant implications for patient management...|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{multicentre}} phase II trial (DOVIGIST) {{evaluated the}} antitumour activity of dovitinib as second-line treatment {{of patients with}} gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) refractory to imatinib or who do not tolerate imatinib. Methods: Patients received oral dovitinib 500 mg day(- 1), 5 days on/ 2 days off, until GIST progression or unacceptable toxicity, with an objective to evaluate efficacy, assessed as the disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks. Tumour assessment and response to dovitinib therapy <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>Response</b> Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v 1. 1) and the Choi criteria. Secondary objectives included assessment of progression-free survival (PFS), safety and tolerability, and DCR {{at the end of}} treatment. Results: Thirty-eight of the 39 patients enrolled had histologically confirmed GIST. The DCR at 12 weeks was 52. 6 % (90 % confidence interval (CI), 38. 2 - 66. 7 %) meeting the preset efficacy criterion for the primary end point. The objective response rate (complete response+partial response) was 2. 6 % (1 of 38; 90 % CI, 0. 1 - 11. 9 %), and 5. 3 % (n = 2; 90 % CI, 0. 9 - 15. 7 %) {{at the end of the}} study. The median PFS was 4. 6 months (90 % CI, 2. 8 - 7. 4 months). Dose interruption was required in 26 patients (66. 7 %), of which 18 (69. 2 %) were due to adverse events. The most frequently observed grade 3 adverse events included hypertension (n = 7), fatigue (n = 5), vomiting (n = 4), hypertriglyceridaemia (n = 4), and gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (n = 4). Conclusions: Dovitinib is an active treatment for patients with GIST who are intolerant to imatinib or whose GIST progresses on imatinib...|$|R
