5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|Smyth was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} report by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them. It also served as an indication as to what information was declassified; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information, such as basic nuclear physics, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily deducible by a competent scientist, and omitted details about chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> physics.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Metallica. I <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the pieces}} that the duchess {{actually}} ordered I thought were hideous. Those wouldn’t work for the movie, so we modified and invented. Wallis wasn’t pretty; she was handsome, at best. In England, it was noted over and over how unattractive she was. But Wallis {{was a lot of}} fun—very entertaining. She had a freedom to her that was definitely reflected in her clothes; the duchess <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> presentation. And that became her refuge, and her prison.|$|E

She said that, at one show, she went backstage and talked with Groundling member Phil Hartman and asked him what the group <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> This led to her taking classes there and eventually being asked into the Groundling's main company. While Kathy was a Groundling, she became best friends with Judy Toll.|$|E

25|$|A modest ratings success, KITS {{fought off}} {{competition}} from the legendary AM CHR station, KFRC (which changed format to big bands in 1986), as well as KMEL-FM, which had switched from album-oriented rock to CHR in 1984. 105 KITS was, for a while, {{the darling of the}} Jet Set; daily visits were common from movie celebrities such as Bette Midler, Tom Cruise, Pat Morita, George Takei, Anthony Perkins and others. The celebs didn't usually make it on the air, but they toured the studios in San Francisco's Merchandise Mart just to see what the industry buzz <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1860's when Europe <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> made to fit {{tailoring}} crinolines {{were considered}} impractical. In 1870's women preferred more slimmer silhouette hence bodices grew longer and polonaise was introduced {{that was a}} skirt and bodice made together. In 1870s there was a invention of Ciurass Bodice that {{is a piece of}} armour that covers the torso and functions like a corset. Towards the end of Victorian reign dresses were flared naturally as crinolines were rejected by middle class women and designers such as Charles Fredrick Worth were also against it. All these inventions and changes in fashion led to women liberation as tailored looks improved posture and were more practical.|$|E
25|$|After Guerrero {{turned on}} Santo and allied with Art Barr as La Pareja del Terror (The Pair of Terror), the duo became {{arguably the most}} hated tag team in lucha libre history. Along with Barr, Konnan, Chicano Power, and Madonna’s Boyfriend, Guerrero formed Los Gringos Locos (The Crazy Americans), a villainous stable. Guerrero later said {{that no matter how}} many people joined Los Gringos Locos, the stable <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Barr. Locos feuded mostly with El Hijo del Santo and his partner Octagón, {{eventually}} ending in a Hair vs. Mask match at the first lucha pay-per-view in America, When Worlds Collide, which they lost.|$|E

25|$|The team's 1993 Bathurst victory <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> speed. The #11 Castrol Holden VP Commodore {{was clearly}} the fastest car all week, topping every {{practice}} and qualifying session, except the first practice session, in which the car placed second. The race was a race in three, between Perkins and Hansford, Mark Skaife and Jim Richards in a Winfield sponsored Commodore, and Tomas Mezera and Win Percy in a Holden Racing Team Commodore. When Percy crashed the #15 car after a throttle jammed, the race was a straight fight between Perkins/Hansford and the Skaife/Richards car. The outright speed of the Perkins car saw the team home, despite a late race flurry of rain, which made tyre selection into a lottery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{international}} game, Scotland against England on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1–1–8 or 1–2–7 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2–2–6 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, {{and one or two}} players would hang around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead for someone else to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E
25|$|The Prince {{then takes}} Elika's body outside. There are four Fertile Grounds there, {{each with a}} tree, that {{according}} to what Elika had told him, channel the power of all the Fertile Grounds to the Tree of Life. He is given a vision {{which is the same}} one both he and Elika shared much earlier that shows her father's deal with Ahriman to revive her. When they shared the vision at that time she told the Prince that visions come from Ormazd, not Ahriman. The vision (just like the main debate throughout the game between Elika and the Prince <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Destiny vs Free Will) is all about choice. The Prince re-creates the deal made by Elika's father. He destroys the four Fertile Grounds around the Temple and returns inside. He cuts down the Tree of Life and takes the light power Elika used to heal the Tree. The Prince returns the Light to Elika's body, and she returns to life. The game ends with the Prince carrying Elika across the desert while Ahriman's darkness envelops the world.|$|E
