Interventionists then sought to relocate the takahē to “island sanctuaries” and breed them in captivity.

Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams.

500|$|Scott Dalrymple, in {{his journal}} article on The Bread-Winners, argues, [...] "the brunt of Hay's ire seems aimed less toward these working men {{themselves}} than toward troublesome union organizers.

To Hay, unions were dangerous as they manipulate the uneducated worker; it was better for laborers to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> pay and conditions individually with their employer, as Sleeny does with Matchin. In his journal article, Frederic Jaher notes that Offitt, a self-described reformer, [...] "is arrogant, tyrannical and self-righteous.

Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, [...] "It was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else [...] solve all of our problems, but in the end you gotta do it yourself".|$|E
