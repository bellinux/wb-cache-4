25|$|The {{difference}} between two models is that hierarchical model can explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non-hierarchical model can only predict joint probability of stimuli.

25|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the reality throughout most of Europe, there are still some examples of Portuguese Romanesque civil architecture that survived to our days, specially the fortified noble residences or Domus Fortis (in Portuguese:"Casa-Torre"). Most are no longer more than single towers that stand out from more modern constructions carried out in the house that surrounds them, and many were remodelled in later Gothic and Renaissance styles, but their Romanesque features are still very much visible. These noble fortified manors were built within, or in the periphery, of feudal lands (Coutos or Honras), among agricultural fertile valleys. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> find them in neighbouring areas of forests or mountain ranges where nobility could control new farm lands outside more occupied regions in which the purchase of new lands and titles was more difficult.|$|E

25|$|To {{see that}} the Petersen graph has no Hamiltonian cycle C, {{consider}} the edges in the cut disconnecting the inner 5-cycle from the outer one. If there is a Hamiltonian cycle, an even number of these edges must be chosen. If only {{two of them are}} chosen, their end-vertices must be adjacent in the two 5-cycles, which is not possible. Hence 4 of them are chosen. Assume that the top edge of the cut is not chosen (all the other cases are the same by symmetry). Of the 5 edges in the outer cycle, the two top edges must be chosen, the two side edges must not be chosen, and hence the bottom edge must be chosen. The top two edges in the inner cycle must be chosen, but this completes a non-spanning cycle, which cannot be part of a Hamiltonian cycle. Alternatively, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> describe the ten-vertex 3-regular graphs that do have a Hamiltonian cycle and show that none of them is the Petersen graph, by finding a cycle in each of them that is shorter than any cycle in the Petersen graph. Any ten-vertex Hamiltonian 3-regular graph consists of a ten-vertex cycle C plus five chords. If any chord connects two vertices at distance two or three along C from each other, the graph has a 3-cycle or 4-cycle, and therefore cannot be the Petersen graph. If two chords connect opposite vertices of C to vertices at distance four along C, there is again a 4-cycle. The only remaining case is a Möbius ladder formed by connecting each pair of opposite vertices by a chord, which again has a 4-cycle. Since the Petersen graph has girth five, it cannot be formed in this way and has no Hamiltonian cycle.|$|E

500|$|<b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{estimate}} {{the amount of}} land needed to produce this amount of grain, thanks to Wolfram Eberhard who [...] "estimates the average yield as being 1.0 to 1.5 shih per mu," [...] though Hsu notes that, [...] "Very high yields could reach as much as 6.4 hu per mu." [...] Swann gives 1 shi 石 (which she translates as [...] "picul" [...] with a weight of [...] "64 lbs. 8.8 oz.") as between 1 and 2 hu, {{depending on the type}} of grain. Based only on Eberhard’s yields and Swann’s range of conversion between shi and hu, a farmer would need between about 85 and 254 mu (between about 9.7 and 29 acres) in order to produce the 127 hu of grain Eberhard deems necessary to the subsistence of a family of five. Other scholars give other numbers, however. Hsu claims that 50 mu (about 5.7 acres) was in fact [...] "the acreage needed for subsistence living," [...] while Wang Zhongshu calculates that [...] "there was on the average 24.6 mou per family, or less than 6 mou per person (with each mou equivalent to 456 square m)." [...] Both Li Kui and Chao Cuo claimed that 100 mu was the amount of land required to support a family, though it should be noted that the amount of land denoted by the word mu had changed between Li Kui's time and Chao Cuo's.|$|E

[...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it.
