40|$|Exposure {{estimates}} {{were required to}} support an epidemiological study of occupational noise and cardiovascular disease. The study cohort consisted of male industrial workers employed at two nuclear facilities in England between 1945 and 1999 (n = 2412). Historical noise exposure data were available from 6850 sound pressure measurements collected since 1965. Additional information was obtained from interviews with retired and long-term company personnel. Partly {{due to the lack}} of information provided by job title, coupled with the fact that noise behaves differently compared with chemical agents, an unusual approach was used to estimate noise exposure. Rather than grouping homogeneous exposure groups by job title or task, the assessors first used historical sampling data to estimate average <b>area</b> <b>noise</b> levels in each work-place where a survey had been performed. Noise contours were then estimated in the <b>work</b> <b>area</b> and, finally, individual estimates of exposure were further refined based on job title. Estimates were extrapolated to <b>areas</b> where <b>noise</b> surveys were not performed and adjustments were made for potential bias. Overall, noise exposure estimates ranged from 60 to 97 dBA, with a median of 86 dBA. For use in subsequent exposure–response analysis, cohort work histories were used to calculate exposure indices of cumulative, average intensity and exposure duration above 85 dBA. Validation exercises are discussed...|$|R
30|$|For an <b>area</b> <b>noise</b> source with {{arbitrary}} shapes, the vibratory amplitude and phase at each {{location on}} a surface are usually different. Mesh generation can produce {{an infinite number}} of small surfaces, and on each of them, the vibration of points can be assumed to be uniform, making it reasonable to take each small surface as a point noise source. Hence, by applying the sound radiation formula at each of the point noise sources, the sound radiation induced by an <b>area</b> <b>noise</b> source of arbitrary shapes can be integrated (i.e., the Rayleigh integral method). This method was first used by Wallace [34] to calculate the radiation resistance of a rectangular panel.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the mortality from non-respiratory cancers by <b>work</b> <b>area</b> among active and retired male {{workers of the}} German rubber industry. METHODS: A cohort of 11, 633 male German workers was followed up for mortality from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1991. Cohort members were active (n = 7536) or retired (n = 4127) on 1 January 1981 and had been employed {{for at least one}} year in one of five study plants producing tyres or technical rubber goods. Work histories were reconstructed from routinely documented "cost centre codes" and classified into six categories: I preparation of materials; II production of technical rubber goods; III production of tyres; IV storage and dispatch; V general service; VI others. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs), controlling for age and calendar year and stratified by <b>work</b> <b>area</b> (employment in respective <b>work</b> <b>area</b> for at least one year) and time related variables (year of hire, lagged years of employment in <b>work</b> <b>area)</b> were calculated from national mortality rates as the reference. RESULTS: Significant increases in mortality were found for pharyngeal cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> IV (three deaths, SMR 486, 95 % CI 101 to 1419), oesophageal cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> III (11 deaths, SMR 227, 95 % CI 114 to 407), and leukaemia in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> I (11 deaths, SMR 216; 95 % CI 108 to 387) and II (14 deaths, SMR 187; 95 % CI 102 to 213). Furthermore, increased SMRs were found for stomach cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> I (22 deaths, SMR 134; 95 % CI 84 to 203), colon cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> II (27 deaths, SMR 131, 95 % CI 86 to 191), prostatic cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> V (27 deaths, SMR 152, 95 % CI 99 to 221), and bladder cancer in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> IV (six deaths, SMR 253; 95 % CI 93 to 551) and V (12 deaths, SMR 159, 95 % CI 82 to 279).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects on upper limb and lower back muscles activities during prolonged sitting in two different <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundaries. The effects are measured from the muscle activities of subjects performing two repetitive tasks at the near <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary and at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary. Subjects consisted of 10 males (age 27. 7 +/- 5. 42) and 10 females (age 27. 5 +/- 5. 91) with no history of musculoskeletal injury or back problem at the time of participation. Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal were recorded from the right and left Levator Scapulae, Upper Trapezius, Anterior Deltoid and Erector Spinae which are known as the weaken and tighten muscles due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). The EMG signal was processed and normalized in the form of % MVC for analysis. The overall results indicated that muscle activities in the upper limb and lower back increased significantly when performing work at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary. The most active muscle is the Left Erector Spinae (2. 37 % MVC at the near, 2. 91 % MVC at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary), while the lowest active muscle is the Left Anterior Deltoid (0. 09 % MVC at the near, 0. 13 % MVC at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary). The muscle activity at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary is on average 17 % greater than at the near <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary. Females showed greater muscular activity compared to males at the near (average difference, 1. 28 % MVC) and at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary (average difference, 1. 56 % MVC).

METHODS: A cohort of 11, 663 male German workers was followed up for mortality from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1991. Cohort members were classified as active (n = 7536) or retired (n = 4127) as of 1 January 1981 and had been employed {{for at least one}} year in one of five study plants producing tyres or technical rubber goods. Work histories were reconstructed with routinely documented "cost centre codes" which were classified into six categories: I preparation of materials; II production of technical rubber goods; III production of tyres; IV storage and dispatch; V maintenance; and VI others. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) adjusted for age and calendar year and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs), stratified by <b>work</b> <b>area</b> (employment in respective <b>work</b> <b>area</b> for at least one year) and time related variables (year of hire, lagged years of employment in <b>work</b> <b>area),</b> were calculated from national reference rates. RESULTS: SMRs for laryngeal cancer were highest in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> I (SMR 253; 95 % CI 93 to 551) and were significant among workers who were employed for > 10 years in this <b>work</b> <b>area</b> (SMR 330; 95 % CI 107 to 779). Increased mortality rates from lung cancer were identified in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> I (SMR 162; 95 % CI 129 to 202), II (SMR 134; 95 % CI 109 to 163), and V (SMR 131; 95 % CI 102 to 167). Mortality from pleural cancer was increased in all six <b>work</b> <b>areas,</b> and significant excesses were found in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> I (SMR 448; 95 % CI 122 to 1146), II (SMR 505; 95 % CI 202 to 1040), and V (SMR 554; 95 % CI 179 to 1290). CONCLUSION: A causal relation between the excess of pleural cancer and exposure to asbestos among rubber workers is plausible and likely. In this study, the pattern of excess of lung cancer parallels the pattern of excess of pleural cancer.
