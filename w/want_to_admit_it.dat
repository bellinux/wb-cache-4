Nor do I believe it is politically possible to rein in the growth of the entitlement programs sufficiently to dispense with the need for a VAT. The best chance to do that was health care reform, but it was missed because the reform did nothing to address the core incentives of both patients and doctors to order more procedures, since the doctors are still paid by procedure and the patients do not bear anything like the full cost.

40|$|Teenage binge-drinking in New Zealand is a {{significant}} health issue {{that is on the}} rise. Understanding why teenagers drink in this manner - and whether they perceive their behaviours negatively - is essential to inform practice and policy aimed at reversing undesirable trends. This study used a social constructionist framework to explore how teenagers talked about binge drinking. It aimed to understand why they binge drink by examining the discourses they draw on to construct their behaviour and the subject positions offered by the discourses. Four semi-structured peer group interviews were conducted with 20 teenagers from Palmerston North, aged 16 - 18 years and with experience of drunkenness and binge drinking. A Foucauldian discourse analysis was conducted on the transcribed data. Participants talked about binge drinking in terms of ‘getting wasted’. A ‘social life’ discourse was used to construct this as ‘fun’ and something all teenagers do – alcohol {{is an integral part of}} their social lives. Participants also drew on an ‘alcohol is bad’ discourse, in which they acknowledged the risks and consequences of alcohol use. However, this discourse was actively resisted, which worked to justify their drinking and ensure they were not positioned negatively. How participants talked about getting wasted was also ‘gendered’. Binge drinking was constructed as a masculine activity, with males positioned as drinking to ‘get wasted’ and engage in risky behaviours. Female participants were positioned as drinking more for social reasons, but also with the intention of getting drunk. Alcohol-related sexual experiences provided subject positions when talking about ‘getting wasted’. Both genders were positioned as ‘getting wasted’ to have sex, with males constructed as ‘sex-obsessed animals’, and females as not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> These discourses together constructed ‘getting wasted’ as something positive and teenage-like, and position teenagers as engaging in behaviour that is not harmful or problematic. The findings from this study have implications for reducing this harmful drinking culture, and making drinking safer for teenagers in Palmerston North and New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Nobody likes mistakes. Fewer yet like {{to revisit}} errors—to analyze, discuss or study them. They are often an embarrassment and {{remind us of}} our fallibility and shortcomings. It is always much easier to {{celebrate}} our achievements and successes—that leaves everyone with a warm feeling. However, although it is always preferable to avoid making mistakes, once they occur they are important and must be recognized as such. They speak to our weaknesses as both individuals and institutions. They are signals, if not alarms, to warn us of deficiencies that must be addressed. In fact, {{it has often been}} said for good reason that one can learn more from one’s mistakes than from one’s successes. The military has always been bad at accepting this premise. Mistakes are often construed as a sign of weakness or inability and many perceive them as potential career-ending events. Such a zero tolerance to mistakes breeds an environment of risk aversion, micro-management and stagnation. It kills initiative and experimentation. And, it avoids examining mistakes in detail—lest blame insidiously spread its evil tentacles and taint others in the chain of command. However, this state affairs leads to atrophy within an organization. It takes strong will and determination to break such a cycle. Normally, crisis is the only catalyst that compels leadership within an organization to take action, and even then it is difficult. The Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Forces (CF), particularly the officer corps, found themselves in such a situation in the late 1980 s and 1990 s. By 1997, they were at the lowest ebb of their history. They had lost the confidence and trust of the government and Canadian people they served. They were stripped of their ability to investigate themselves. Furthermore, they were not trusted to implement the recommended changes forced upon them by the government and an external committee was established as a watchdog. Whether the leadership <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> or not, and they vehemently denied it at the time, there existed some substantial and deep rooted problems with DND, the CF and the officer corps.
