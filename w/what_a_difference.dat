The battle lasted from 17:00 hours on September 23 to the early hours of September 24.

500|$|In 2000, PTC's report <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>Difference</b> a Decade Makes {{allegedly}} {{stated that}} there was an increase in profanity, sex, and violence on television during the 1990s. The report also claimed that references to homosexuality increased the most during that decade - by 24-fold. In 2002, the PTC released a report claiming {{that there was}} an increase in profanity on network programming shown during the first hour of prime time. In a 2006 report titled Wolves in Sheep's Clothing, analyst Kristen Fyfe perceived an increase in violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming. Among its results, based on research during summer 2005, the PTC stated that Teen Titans was the most violent program, and claimed Cartoon Network had the most violent incidents. Richard Huff of the New York Daily News criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, [...] "Sailor Mouth", over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly.|$|E

We are here because we have a President, who is true, is a true man of God. A man who prays every day.
