Special stones are manufactured for this purpose, usually with a <b>wooden</b> <b>handle</b> to aid their manipulation; such stones are also known as chi ishi. It is a common practice in karate, used in solo training to improve stances and upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting {{on the back of a}} rocking chair, which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its <b>wooden</b> <b>handle.</b> It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of rolling mills, presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and François Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted <b>wooden</b> <b>handle,</b> which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|E

25|$|The adze is {{depicted}} in ancient Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Originally the adze blades were made of stone, but already in the Predynastic Period copper adzes had all but replaced those made of flint.

25|$|In Northern England and Scotland dead bells are not {{uncommon}} as symbols of death on funerary monuments. As an emblem of mortality the dead bell was mainly confined to eighteenth century tombstones in the North-East of Scotland, especially in Morayshire and Aberdeenshire. In Angus and Perthshire its use is rare and further south it only occurs on seventeenth century stones. The handbell is more common than the church bell and rope, the <b>wooden</b> <b>handle</b> on former being clearly depicted.|$|E

The peat bank is first cleared of heather turfs. The peat, now exposed, is cut using the tairsgeir and the peats thrown out on the bank to dry. A good peat cutter can cut 1000 peats in a day.|$|E
25|$|The kusarigama is a chain-and-sickle weapon. The {{weapon is}} used in several ryu and the design varies from school to school. The kusarigama used in Isshin-ryū has a straight, {{double-edged}} 30cm blade with a <b>wooden</b> <b>handle</b> approx 36cm long with an iron guard to protect the hand. The chain (kusari) has a heavy iron weight and {{is attached to the}} bottom of the handle. The chain is 12 shaku long (3.6 meters) and the attached weight can be thrown against an opponent's weapon, hands or body, either disarming him or otherwise preventing him from properly defending himself against the kama. In some kata, the iron weight is thrown directly at the attackers body causing injury or stunning the opponent.|$|E

(for this nation in matters of trust is the most treacherous in the world), they straightway gathered {{to the number of}} one hundred thousand under the leadership of Theudebert I and marched into Italy: they had a small body of cavalry about their leader, and these were the only ones armed with spears, while all the rest were foot soldiers having neither bows nor spears, but each man carried a sword and shield and one axe. Now the iron head of this weapon was thick and exceedingly sharp on both sides, while the <b>wooden</b> <b>handle</b> was very short. And they are accustomed always to throw these axes at a signal in the first charge and thus to shatter the shields of the enemy and kill the men.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded precursors to {{the modern}} hammer throw stem from the Tailteann Games of ancient Ireland, which featured events such as throwing either a weight attached to a rope, a large rock on a <b>wooden</b> <b>handle,</b> or even a chariot wheel on a wooden axle. Other ancient competitions included throwing a cast iron ball attached to a <b>wooden</b> <b>handle</b> – {{the root of the}} term [...] "hammer throw" [...] due to their resemblance to the tools. In 16th century England, contests involving the throwing of actual blacksmith's Sledgehammers were recorded. The hammer implement was standardised in 1887 and the competitions began to resemble the modern event. The weight of the metal ball was set at 16pounds (7.26kg) while the attached wire had to measure between 1.175m and 1.215m.|$|E

500|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74 {{consisted}} of a glass sphere in which was contained approximately [...] of semi-liquid nitroglycerin devised by ICI. The sphere was covered in stockinette which was coated with a liberal amount of birdlime, an extremely adhesive substance from which the nickname 'sticky bomb' was derived. A casing made out of thin sheet-metal, and formed of two halves, was then placed around the sphere and {{held in place by}} a <b>wooden</b> <b>handle,</b> inside which was a five-second fuse. The handle also contained two pins and a lever; the first pin was pulled out to make the casing fall away, and the second to activate the firing mechanism in the grenade. This primed the grenade, with the lever being held down to ensure the fuse was not triggered; then the user would run up to the tank and stick the grenade to its hull, using as much force as possible to break the sphere and spread the nitroglycerin onto the hull in a thick paste. Another alternative was for the user to throw it at the tank from a distance. Either way, the lever would be released and the fuse activated, and the grenade would then detonate.|$|E
