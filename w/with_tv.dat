5|$|In 2007, two {{driving under}} the {{influence}} incidents led to Lohan being put on probation, and together with three visits to rehabilitation facilities caused the loss of several movie deals. In 2008 and 2009, Lohan worked as a fashion model and launched the clothing line 6126. She resumed her acting career <b>with</b> <b>TV</b> work in 2008, and starred in the TV film Labor Pains (2009). She appeared in Robert Rodriguez's feature film Machete (2010). Between 2010 and 2013, Lohan went into rehabilitation three times, and spent much of her time entangled in legal problems stemming from misdemeanors and probation violations.

After this, the State Attorney challenged {{the conditions of}} release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and/or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August 2, 2012, the appellate court rejected the State Attorney's second complaint and ordered Blythe's immediate release.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was taken up <b>with</b> <b>TV</b> shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they had no time for family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients could see it was him. After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E
