6000|$|... "Is he, indeed? I was {{thinking}} of something else just at that moment. You remember <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> about Miss Palliser last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} got on very well, Bertie, with Mrs. Dias. I did not hear <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> but you {{seemed to be doing}} stunningly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Since I saw you yesterday,' said Sir Gregory, 'I {{have been}} {{thinking}} much of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> to me of your wish to go into Parliament.' ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{am having}} {{difficulty}} hearing <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying!</b> Please repeat <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> trying to <b>say.</b>|$|R
5|$|Shand: Think <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> One {{or other}} was a {{deliberate}} and wicked lie.|$|R
60|$|BRIDGET. I don't {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> [Looks out.] There is a {{crowd of}} people talking to your pupils.|$|R
6000|$|Warned by a {{sign from}} Gardner, the others ignored him, and Harding remarked to the farmer, [...] "You hadn't {{finished}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> when he disturbed you." ...|$|E
6000|$|HE, with {{exemplary}} meekness: [...] "Only <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> before Grinnidge came in. You didn't whisper then. I {{had to wait}} {{there for}} him while" [...] - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I couldn’t hear <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> {{and then}} when you went outside and I asked you whether you were going home you said ’yes,’ didn’t you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|STRAMMFEST. You do {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> This <b>is</b> pure Bolshevism. Are you, the {{daughter}} of a Panjandrum, a Bolshevist? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cheated!" [...] thundered {{the great}} man. [...] "Be careful, young lady; mind <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> I have a witness; Eustace, you hear, 'cheated'! Eustace, 'cheated'!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold blanched. [...] "Reggie, old man, <b>you</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>You</b> can't {{remember}} Percy. I {{wish you}} wouldn't say these things, even in fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, father, {{that is just}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> you wanted, and I am {{sure you}} spent hours every day walking about with the children, or telling them stories." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{go back to}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> just now," [...] Tavernake remarked, [...] "I quite {{agree with}} you about Beatrice's living alone. I am very anxious for her to marry me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And as to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> Fanny, as {{to having}} nothing to support the title, a foreign title in that way is not like one here at home. Here it must be supported." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> Rima. <b>You</b> might as well say: 'Come, let us go to the sun and find out {{everything}} in it.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} can that be?" [...] his friend asked. [...] "Are you sure that <b>you</b> know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying?</b> Is your head quite clear, old friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cilla,' he said, {{in great}} agitation, 'let me know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> Don't drive me crazy {{when it is}} not in the nature of things you should mean it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I have heard <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> over the {{telephone}} that I am here," [...] he declared. [...] "I want to know to whom you were sending that message which you have intercepted outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> to the tree?" [...] {{asked the}} Egyptian, demurely. Then, perhaps {{thinking}} it wisest not to press this point, she continued irrelevantly, [...] "It seems such a pity {{that you are}} a minister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} you try to make my cousin angry; you that ought to have so much sense? Don't you {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> yourself the other day, of the absurdity of combatting pretences which the world sanctions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear! <b>You</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>You</b> {{forget that}} this self-abandonment, and extravagant grief {{would be wrong}} in any one; and, if nothing else, the display is unbecoming in you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As usual, Chebron, {{your tongue}} outruns your discretion. This youth understands enough Egyptian to know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> and it <b>is</b> not courteous {{to speak of}} a person's {{characteristics}} to his face." ...|$|R
50|$|When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> of trusted chat status {{you have}} the largest {{approved}} vocabulary available to talk with. It may also allow small typos that do not change the meaning of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, no. I {{mean you}} and Maud {{have been talking}} to each other for quite a long time, and she seemed very {{interested}} in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> I hoped you might have some good news for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he said, rising, [...] "you {{have put}} it quite out of my head; I've been so absorbed in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> But may I ask just where in your {{treatment}} of the theme your irony ends?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Constance dear, what harm {{can there}} be in expressing them?" [...] said Fan. [...] "They are not absurd fancies any more than <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> just now. I am quite sure that Mr. Northcott is very fond of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here her {{attention}} was suddenly arrested by Madonna, who was eagerly and even impatiently signing on her fingers: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> to Patty? Oh! do {{let me know}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> to Patty?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{would then}} say, [...] "I know exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> to yourself, you’re wrong, I know <b>what</b> you’re saying. <b>You</b> wicked lot. You’re {{the sort of}} people that get me a bad name!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not true, Henry. <b>You</b> cannot mean <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> I {{have always}} been the same. I am the same now. What could alter me? You don't believe that {{anything}} could alter me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> regarding information as to Mahmud's intentions. With your permission, I am ready to undertake to go into his camp, {{and to find out}} what the general opinion is as to his plans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they knew}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> {{they would lose}} all respect for you, Beric," [...] she said {{laughing}} and colouring. [...] "We have been married nearly a year, sir--a great deal too long for you to pay me compliments." ...|$|E
60|$|FANNY [she turns--walks {{slowly back}} towards the tea-table. Halfway she pauses, and leaning {{over the back of}} a chair regards in silence for a while the {{portrait}} of the first Lady Bantock]. I do wish I could tell <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe it. Why, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a mere boy--you don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> I'll {{close up}} this {{business}} to suit myself and leave my keys with Captain Marshall, {{and that will}} end it." ...|$|R
60|$|Cease, cease, my foolish babe, <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> sorrowful to me--much it displeases me; Behold {{with the}} rest, again I say--behold not banners and pennants aloft; But the well-prepared {{pavements}} behold--and mark the solid-walled houses.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} wrong, for {{you might see}} that Mr. Shipley has twice checked his horse that he might hear <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> and Phemie <b>is</b> always showing Mrs. Ashwood {{something}} in the landscape behind us." ...|$|R
