5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a <b>wise</b> <b>man,</b> who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E
50|$|Bragmanni were unclothed, cave-dwelling <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> {{who were}} {{extremely}} moralistic and ascetic. They are often merged or confused with Gymnosophists, a similar group of <b>wise</b> <b>men.</b>|$|R
60|$|And thus Cyril, {{usually the}} most {{impatient}} and intractable of plotters, gave in, as <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> should, to a <b>wiser</b> <b>man</b> than himself, {{and made up}} his mind to keep the secret, and to command the monk to keep it also.|$|R
50|$|The third {{chapter of}} this Gospel covers {{the story of}} the <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> of the East, which, in some respects, closely follows the version of the story from Matthew. Unlike Matthew, however, this account cites Zoradascht (Zoroaster) as the source of the prophecy that {{motivated}} the <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> to seek the infant Jesus.|$|R
5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the imminent arrival of the stoor worm sought {{the advice of a}} <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> or spaeman, who suggests that the beast might be appeased if it is fed seven virgins every week. In line with the wise man's advice, every Saturday the islanders provide a sacrificial offering of seven virgins, who were tied up and placed on the beach for the serpent to sweep into its mouth as it reared its head from the sea.|$|E
5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E
5|$|Though Link {{must still}} collect several items {{in order to}} {{progress}} in the game (as in the previous and subsequent installments of the series), these special items grant abilities which either remain in permanent use {{for the rest of}} the game or can only be activated in the overworld. In place of actively used items, The Adventure of Link features eight spells for Link to use during action scenes. Each spell is learned from a different <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> in one of the eight towns within Hyrule. Link often has to complete side-quests, such as retrieving lost items, before they will teach him their spells. Some spells and items are necessary for advancing beyond certain points in the game. Also, the Life spell becomes the main means of recovering health during action scenes, since healing Fairies are only found in rare fixed spots, and only appear randomly as overworld encounters.|$|E

5|$|The game's opening sees Ringford {{holding the}} Cauldron and its {{controlling}} ring Titrel, having been given Titrel by Ingway {{as part of}} his vengeance against Odin. Elfaria is ultimately killed by Odin, who takes Titrel from her. Velvet steals it in turn and gives it to the dragon Wagner, hoping that this would prevent the Cauldron being used. Her lover Cornelius is meanwhile changed into a Pooka by Ingway and thrown into the Netherworld, escaping with the aid of his grandfather Gallon. He learns that the people of Valentine share his curse, and is embroiled in both the Pookas' efforts to collect wish-granting coins to reverse their condition and his attempts to save Velvet from danger. The Three Wise Men are attempting to fulfill the prophecies of the Armageddon — all but one <b>Wise</b> <b>Man</b> are killed {{during the course of the}} story, while the third Beldor is afflicted with the Pooka's curse and gains subsequent immortality. Cornelius rescues Velvet from their clutches, and despite his fears she reaffirms her love for him in his new form. Several characters also encounter King Valentine, who continues to be tormented by memories of murdering Velvet's mother in a rage — {{as part of his}} scheme to trigger the Armageddon, he hatches the dragon Leventhan.|$|E

50|$|Some {{cultures}} {{regarded the}} mediator as a sacred figure, worthy of particular respect; {{and the role}} partly overlapped with that of traditional <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> or tribal chief. Members of peaceful communities frequently brought disputes before local leaders or <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> to resolve local conflicts. This peaceful method of resolving conflicts was particularly prevalent in communities of Confucians and Buddhists.|$|R

25|$|Haven heads there, {{and meets}} the <b>Wise</b> <b>Man</b> (Terry Bertram), who tells him {{the legend of}} Athellion; Vetch was {{determined}} to conquer Athellion's city, Aurias. However, {{he was unable to}} even approach the city, as its light would blind him. When Athellion left for the war, Vetch bribed a council member to infect the people with the virus, so they became his slaves. Over time, even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten. However, the <b>Wise</b> <b>Man</b> directs Haven to a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria. Haven reaches the Golden Voice, reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung, the person who rings it must wait there for Athellion's return. He rings it, but immediately Chess contacts him, telling him she is stranded without any antidote. He reluctantly leaves, returning to Ferra, and rescuing Chess.|$|E
25|$|On {{the upper}} surface {{we have a}} {{depiction}} of the distressed Virgin Mary being supported by John the Evangelist and two female saints ("Pamoison de la Vierge"), Mary Magdalene and Mary Salome. In the next scene Jesus is being flogged by two soldiers who tighten the blindfold as they apply their whips. On the frieze below the first sculpture on the left shows Elizabeth (biblical figure) visiting the Virgin Mary (the Visitation (Christianity)), the one pregnant with Jesus Christ {{and the other with}} John the Baptist, this being followed by three scenes relating to the nativity. Firstly we see Saint Joseph sleeping in the stable with two cattle next to him. Then we see the Virgin Mary laying in a bed {{and at the end of}} this bed is a depiction of a standing Jesus aged about 7 years this followed by the Adoration of the Magi. The first <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> is kneeling before the bed whilst the second, dressed in the doublet worn in the reign of Charles VII, is pointing with his finger to the star which led them to the stable and addressing the third <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> who is smaller in stature.|$|E
25|$|Barely 300 chasidim survived, and the Rebbe's son Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam took it {{upon himself}} to rebuild Bobov. He first settled in the West Side of Manhattan, later moving to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. The Yeshiva was located {{on the west side of}} Brooklyn Avenue at 184 Brooklyn Avenue between Park Place and Prospect Place; it later moved to Borough Park. Rabbi Shlomo was known as a very <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> and a Gaon in Midos (giant in good manners/attributes). He was noted for his steadfastness in not taking sides in disputes. This brought him great {{popularity}} and respect.|$|E

Johnson, a former top aide to Walter Mondale. From 1985 until 1993, Holbrooke served as managing director of Lehman Brothers. During this time, he co-authored Counsel to the President, The New York Times best-selling memoirs of legendary Democratic <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, published in 1991. He was a top policy adviser to then-Senator Al Gore (D-TN) during his 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. And four years later he advised Bill Clinton, in his quest for the White House.|$|E
25|$|After being {{transported to}} the Middle Ages, Ash Williams is {{captured}} by Lord Arthur's men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's <b>Wise</b> <b>Man.</b> After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as {{he knew it was}} a witch hunt, and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.|$|E
25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a <b>wise</b> <b>man,</b> he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

5000|$|Allen Mandelbaum's [...] "Chelmaxioms : The Maxims, Axioms, Maxioms of Chelm" [...] (David R.

The poetry of Chelmaxioms is supposedly the discovered lost manuscripts of the <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> of Chelm.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some {{important}} message, so he consults his <b>wise</b> <b>men.</b> Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation the king refuses to tell the <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises Daniel over all his <b>wise</b> <b>men,</b> and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon.|$|R
