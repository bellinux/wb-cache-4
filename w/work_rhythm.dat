50|$|Unlike Bengalis’ {{depiction}} of dominance to expose inequality in gender, Marina Abramovic used subjugation {{as a form}} of exposing the position of women in society that horrified rather than disturbed the audience. In her performance <b>work</b> <b>Rhythm</b> 0 (1974), Ambramovic pushed not only her limits, but her audience’s limits as well, by presenting the public with 72 different objects ranging from a feathers and perfume to a rifle and a bullet. Her instructions were simple; She was the object and the audience could do whatever they wanted with her body for the next six hours. Her audience had complete control while she laid motionless. Eventually they became wilder and started violating her body- at one point one man took the pistol with the bullet and had it aimed at Ambramovic hoping she would pull the trigger. After the six hours, she began to move and the public got into a frenzy and ran away in fear. As if they could not come to terms with what just happened. In this emotional performance piece, Ambramovic depicts the powerful message of the objectification of the female body {{while at the same time}} unraveling the complexity of human nature.|$|E

This study is based on interviews with workers in “Nor-Oil”, an organisation working within the petroleum industry. Nor-Oil was responsible for one part of the project studied in this case, project Alpha. Nor-Oil had many challenges during this project, where some of these were considered to influence rhythm and flow of the workers and the level of success. Through this study, we found that the main internal factors setting the <b>work</b> <b>rhythm</b> were: insufficient planning in project organisation, no clear and realistic schedules, contract workers, structured and informative handover meetings and unstructured and inefficient project meetings, in addition to the external factor Acknowledgement of Compliance. In project Alpha, we found that the good temperamental job-fit of the workers was most likely a factor influencing the <b>work</b> <b>rhythm</b> in a positive way. The experience of flow was present for some of the workers, but it become clear that it was a highly individual factor. From this we can state that flow is not a prerequisite for gaining success. Project Alpha maintained the quality of work and was completed within the final deadline, while costs were understood as non-relevant factor for the level of success of project Alpha.

50|$|As {{work life}} {{integration}} {{becomes more and}} more of a choice for many workers, employees seek to have more flexibility in deciding their shift timings. It has been propounded that the inability of employers to introduce flexibility in shift timings is a potential pain point for employees who have to balance non-work commitments with their work commitments. It might also become a source of conflict for employees with heavy family responsibilities, such as that of a caregiver. Incremental benefits can be reaped from allowing workers to work in shifts based on their family needs or natural <b>work</b> <b>rhythms,</b> where job satisfaction and productivity can increase with greater employee engagement.|$|R

40|$|Two major {{prerequisites}} for capitalist development are (i) the securement of a regulär and adequate supply of labour and (ii) {{the establishment of}} managen al control over the labour process, so as to raise labour productivity. Their realization may be particularly problematic {{in areas where the}} capitalist mode of production has not yet deeply penetrated and where {{the majority of the population}} has neither been completely divorced from the means of production nor internalized the norms and values of capitalism. Rural producers, who are still strongly rooted in non-capitalist forms of Organisation and value-systems, may resist their entry into the capitalist labour market and their habituation to the capitalist <b>work</b> <b>rhythm</b> and ethic. Chieftaincy in Africa has played a significant intermediary role between capital and labour in the realization of these objectives.

40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} {{the possible}} contributions of ethnography to the flourishing market for impact evaluations of culture-led regeneration policies. The growing need for accountability has multiplied university engagement in commissioned evaluations, as these seem to provide good {{financial support for}} research. These evaluations, however, have to follow a <b>work</b> <b>rhythm</b> that threatens to transform scientific research into the production of consumer goods as only certain methods can produce results fast enough for the dominant agenda. The predominance of quantitative, or at least quantifiable, data concerning evaluations of cultural policy is hence no surprise. Sticking {{to the requirements of}} classic ethnography seems therefore to exclude the participation of social anthropology in this market or - seen by the perspective this paper adopts - deprives policy-makers of valuable insights into the impacts of cultural policy on local population (the use of ethnography in policy research is also discussed in Chapter 6).

40|$|The ongoing {{integration}} of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) into higher education courses {{is often called}} blended learning although it often relates to course design. It is usually understood in place categories, as a combination of traditional classroom-based sessions and Internet-enabled distance or online learning practices. One alternative understanding of ICT integration can be constructed of time categories, {{with an understanding of}} ICTs more as process- and project-related. Two such design frameworks are conceptually presented and then used together in a small case study in a pilot experiment in physics at the preparatory level for entering engineering programs at a university in Northern Sweden. These are a) time shift mechanisms between synchronous and asynchronous learning modes in the course process and b) agile frameworks mechanisms adapted from work process developments in the software industry. Both are here used to address common procrastination problems in flexible education. Data were collected in student interviews and analysed with qualitative content analysis. Results show student satisfaction with the <b>work</b> <b>rhythm</b> and that a feeling of presence, which enables easy interaction, can be facilitated by synchronicity.

40|$|AbstractReasons for the {{particular}} uncertainty of global projects are the foreign environment and people from diverse cultures with different ways of thinking and working procedures. Handling these differences presents a big challenge for any project manager. During implementation they mainly focus on the professional, regulatory and (infra-) structural framework and don’t pay enough attention to the hidden stumbling blocks, namely the management of different people and cultures. Useful researches such as Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the GLOBE leadership study give a good overview of the cultural differences at the workplace. The focus in this paper is on the personal use of cultural knowledge with the main topic: “Effective application of cultural knowledge increases personal productivity”. Success begins in the mind. The core of cultural management in business is to adopt an attitude that is conducive to the personal preparation for the challenge of managing cultural diversity. A survey of differences in country-specific work methods helps to find the appropriate tools to deal with members of different cultures in one project. Three nations, China (Asia), Germany (Europe) and USA (North America) were selected and compared as examples in regard to common <b>work</b> <b>rhythm,</b> discipline and mentality. The results and analysis will help project managers to discover the potential of transnational projects and to improve their individual leadership coordination and management skills in a multicultural project environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Aesthetics of Rhythm Lena Hopsch Chalmers University, Architecture Rhythm as a {{significant}} factor in music and poetry is relatively well scientifically documented. In sculpture and architecture, however, rhythm is a fairly unexplored area, perhaps due to the complex character of the subject and, moreover, in visual art knowledge of the significance of rhythm is mainly acquired by studying individual artists and architects. In view of this background my thesis "The Aesthetics of Rhythm" developed, a study of the visually and bodily experienced rhythm. To be able to form, but also to be able to discuss the creation in a clear and distinct way are important components in an artistic theory formation. They are the basis of one’s own artistic language. One purpose of my work has been to study the design process where the course to the form rather than the form itself is the essential part. In the thesis basic rhythm conceptions such as stress, pausing, contrast and repetition are studied. I have found that these conceptions which are based on the poetics and rhetoric of classical antiquity are good tools also when comes to discussing and analysing rhythm in architecture and sculpture. They are distinct and effective and in my study I have illustrated each of them separately in order to show their distinctive quality, but I have also demonstrated how they co-operate in a flow and thus create rhythm. In the laboratory work which, in my capacity as a sculptor, I have done with a tight-rope-walker and a choreographer the step, the contact of the foot with the floor and the movement of the body in the room have been an important starting-point.
