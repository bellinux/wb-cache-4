5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E

50|$|Diaw {{recorded}} his first career triple-double on January 31, 2006 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> defeated <b>the</b> Philadelphia 76ers at Philadelphia, 123-99. Diaw had 14 points, 13 assists, and 11 rebounds, {{as well as}} a block and zero turnovers in 39 minutes. He {{recorded his}} second career triple-double shortly afterwards on March 5, 2006 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> defeated <b>the</b> Dallas Mavericks, 115-107. On April 14, 2006, Diaw recorded his third career triple-double <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> suffered a loss to the Golden State Warriors, 110-102. Diaw had 11 points, 11 rebounds, and a career-high 16 assists, while adding three blocks and two steals in 42 minutes. Two days later, Diaw recorded his fourth career triple-double against the Los Angeles Lakers as <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> lost 109-89.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> traded Shavlik Randolph for Reggie Bullock on January 15, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{made sure}} {{they had no}} players that were {{over the age of}} 30 on their roster. This marks one of the few, if only times where an NBA team had no one over the age of 30 signed onto their roster. It {{continued}} to be the case until the February 19, 2015 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> got Danny Granger in a trade with the Miami Heat and later on got Earl Barron from the affiliate Bakersfield Jam (back) on the team in the process.|$|R
50|$|January 13, 2015: <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{had their}} 107-100 {{victory over the}} Cleveland Cavaliers, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> would begin their eight-game homestand for January, which marked the longest homestand in {{franchise}} history. This game also marked the Suns' halfway point into the regular season, which came by <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> much faster {{than most of the}} teams in the NBA.|$|R
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
5|$|An annular eclipse occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and Moon {{are exactly}} {{in line with}} the Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> 40th Anniversary <b>Suns</b> Team– {{selected}} by the vote of the fans through the Internet– was unveiled on January 3, 2008, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> defeated <b>the</b> Seattle SuperSonics, 104–96, to celebrate the team's 40th season. The Suns' inaugural game in 1968 was against the Sonics.|$|R

5000|$|The rivalry {{went to a}} {{new level}} in this decade, because <b>the</b> Spurs and <b>Suns</b> met several times in the playoffs. [...] The only Spurs series losses to <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{occurred}} in <b>the</b> 2000 NBA Playoffs, when Duncan was out with a knee injury and in the 2010 NBA Playoffs, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> put up <b>the</b> first 4-0 sweep in this rivalry.|$|R
5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye in the night sky and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is low. To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
5|$|The {{timelines}} displayed here cover {{events from}} the beginning of the 11th millennium to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternate future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans will become extinct, whether protons decay, or whether or not the earth survives <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> expands to the red giant.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon {{is a time}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is {{descending}} {{from its}} daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly {{the center of the}} sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} only <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

50|$|The {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for an organization looking {{to build a new}} core of talent. For {{the first time since the}} 1996 - 97 season, the All-Star Game did not feature a Suns player. To complete the season on a low note, a franchise-record of 13 straight playoff appearances was snapped <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> failed to qualify for postseason play. Following the season, Majerle retired after making his second stint with <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b>|$|R

5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is below the horizon for the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E
50|$|The orbital radius and angular {{velocity}} of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary.

5|$|Some {{have argued}} that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion, {{although}} this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.|$|E
5|$|Some sites along Shackleton's rim receive almost {{constant}} illumination. At these locales sunlight {{is almost}} always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels, potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings. The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100°C <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is overhead, to as low as −150°C during the lunar night.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and {{the planets}} are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{illuminates}} them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, {{and they thought}} the Moon had {{the nature of a}} mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.|$|E
