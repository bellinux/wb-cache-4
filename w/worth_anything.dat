25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us that is <b>worth</b> <b>anything</b> {{is that we}} can be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
500|$|Del Toro and Soderbergh both {{attended}} the French premiere in late November 2008, where they took {{questions from the}} press. Del Toro remarked that the [...] "legendary rebel" [...] was still pertinent because [...] "the things that he fought for in the late 1950s and mid 1960s are still relevant today", adding that [...] "he did not hide behind curtains ... he stood up for the forgotten ones". When asked why he made the film, Soderbergh stated, [...] "I {{needed to make the}} film, and that is a different feeling. I felt like, if I am <b>worth</b> <b>anything,</b> I have to say yes. I can't say no". The following day, the Dubai International Film Festival would describe Soderbergh's narrative as a [...] "magisterial ... compelling experience", with Del Toro's performance as [...] "blue-chip".|$|E

The minimum 'guaranteed' amount of oil in the Irish Atlantic waters is , worth over €450 billion. There are also areas of petroleum and natural gas on shore, for example the Lough Allen basin, with [...] of gas and [...] of oil, valued at €74.4 billion. Already some fields are being exploited, such as the Spanish Point field, with [...] of gas and [...] of oil, valued at €19.6 billion.

500|$|Smith {{received}} a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992, but {{felt it was}} not <b>worth</b> <b>anything,</b> saying [...] "there's {{part of me that}} feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." [...] The Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance is a Creative Arts and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations. However, Smith says [...] "if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson." [...] The show's creator Matt Groening has called Smith very similar to Lisa: [...] "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that. Writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute", as able [...] "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Somers, {{following}} his dismissal as Lord Chancellor, introduced an Act in 1706 which [...] "became {{the most important}} act of law reform which the 18th century produced". The Act significantly amended the existing law and court procedure, and while {{most of it was}} aimed at the common-law courts, it did affect the Chancery. For equity, the Act provided that a party trying to have his case dismissed could not do so until he had paid the full costs, rather than the nominal costs that were previously required; at the same time, the reforms the Act made to common-law procedure (such as allowing claims to be brought against executors of wills) reduced the need for parties to go to equity for a remedy. Legal historian Wilfrid Prest writes that despite these legislative enactments, the tally of which [...] "begins to look quite impressive", the old problems continued, albeit less frequently; one barrister of the time claimed that going to the Court with a case <b>worth</b> <b>anything</b> less than £500 was a waste of time.|$|E

60|$|He {{thought of}} Everard, afire {{with the idea}} of vengence and {{to such an extent that}} he had succeeded in infecting Justin himself with a spark of it. He thought of him with pity almost; pity that a man should obsess his life by such a phantasm as this same vengeance must have been to him. Was it <b>worth</b> while? Was <b>anything</b> <b>worth</b> while, he wondered.|$|R

No amount of credible science is <b>worth</b> <b>anything</b> if you ignore the findings and simply present the message you wanted the data to support." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{growing number}} of miners and {{settlers}} encroaching in the Dakota Territory, however, rapidly nullified the protections. The US government could not keep settlers out. [...] By 1872, territorial officials were considering harvesting the rich timber resources of the Black Hills, to be floated down the Cheyenne River to the Missouri, where new plains settlements needed lumber. The geographic uplift area suggested the potential for mineral resources. When a commission approached the Red Cloud Agency {{about the possibility of}} the Lakota's signing away the Black Hills, Colonel John E. Smith noted that this was [...] "the only portion [...] <b>worth</b> <b>anything</b> to them". [...] He concluded that [...] "nothing short of their annihilation will get it from them".|$|E

I got money on them, it is true, but they are not <b>worth</b> <b>anything.</b> They are only quasi things, and the good debentures are elsewhere.’ We have never seen the whole basis of railway credit so rudely shaken. We could not have believed that such a defence could have been offered. How is Lombard-street ever to rely on having good debentures, when it finds men of the greatest repute and the highest standing offering it documents so very like debentures, but after all not real? ... Of course the company was primarily responsible; but Sir Morton Peto was acting as their trusted financial agent, ... and therefore he must be held responsible, not of course exclusively, but conjointly with those with whom he acted." ...|$|E
