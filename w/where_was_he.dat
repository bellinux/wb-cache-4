2500|$|Once, Saint Anthony tried {{hiding in}} a cave to escape the demons that plagued him. There were so many little demons in the cave though that Saint Anthony's servant had to carry him out because they had beaten him to death. When the hermits were {{gathered}} to Saint Anthony's corpse to mourn his death, Saint Anthony was revived. He demanded that his servants take him back to that cave where the demons had beaten him. When he got there he called out to the demons, and they came back as wild beasts to rip him to shreds. All of a sudden a bright light flashed, and the demons ran away. Saint Anthony knew that the light must have come from God, and he asked God <b>where</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> before when the demons attacked him. God replied, [...] "I was here but I would see and abide to see thy battle, and because thou hast mainly fought and well maintained thy battle, I shall make thy name to be spread through all the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{these years}} Croatia was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of a kingdom. It is generally said that Duke Tomislav was crowned king in 925, but this is not certain since it is not known when and <b>where</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> crowned, or was he crowned at all. However, Tomislav was the first Croatian ruler whom the Papal chancellery honoured with the title king. Tomislav is mentioned as a king in two preserved documents published in the Historia Salonitana and by the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, where Tomislav's rule was specified at 13 years. In a note preceding the text of the Council conclusions in Split in 925 it is written that Tomislav is the king [...] "in the province of the Croats and in the Dalmatian regions" [...] (in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege). In the 12th canon of the Council conclusions in 925 the ruler of the Croats is called [...] "king" [...] (rex et proceres Chroatorum), while in a letter sent by the Pope John X Tomislav is named [...] "King of the Croats" [...] (Tamisclao, regi Crouatorum). Although there are no inscriptions of Tomislav to confirm the title, later inscriptions and charters confirm that his 10th century successors called themselves [...] "kings".|$|E
