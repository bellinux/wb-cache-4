5|$|At the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915, Blücher was slowed {{significantly}} {{after being}} hit by gunfire from the British battlecruiser squadron {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral David Beatty. Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, the commander of the German squadron, decided to abandon Blücher to the pursuing enemy ships in order to save his more valuable battlecruisers. Under heavy fire from the British ships, she was sunk, and British destroyers began recovering the survivors. However, the destroyers withdrew when a German zeppelin began bombing them, mistaking the sinking Blücher for a British battlecruiser. The number of casualties is unknown, <b>with</b> <b>figures</b> ranging from 747 to around 1,000. Blücher was the only warship lost during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Barry's scheme {{provided}} two plinths for sculptures on {{the north}} side of the square. A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey, originally intended to be placed on top of the Marble Arch, was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until the late-20th century. There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues <b>with</b> <b>figures</b> more familiar to the general public.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted <b>with</b> <b>figures</b> carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, he {{accepted}} a teaching {{position at the}} ICY's preparatory school for boys. White furthered his interests in mathematics during his teaching stint at the institute. He became a lecturer on the subject while {{a member of the}} mathematics committee of the Banneker Institute, also becoming a proficient chess player in his leisure time. His exceptional skills <b>with</b> <b>figures</b> and calculations led to different business ventures: he was an agent for the Anglo-African weekly newspaper (1860–1861) and Pine and Palm (1860–1862). In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau of Emigration, empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move to Haiti, via New York. As a result of his different ventures, White became a relatively wealthy man at a young age.|$|E

He produced an article for a January 1933 issue of the Negro Worker, and then another for a November 1933 issue of Labour Monthly. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more extreme position than {{he had in the}} past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans, <b>with</b> <b>figures</b> like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki being far less radical in their demands.

5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers <b>with</b> <b>figures</b> might numb them to the issues.|$|E

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Somerset County No21) and GradeII* listed building.|$|E

Another work by Etty, sold as A Bacchanalian Scene in 1830 and later renamed Landscape <b>with</b> <b>Figures,</b> was identified in 1953 as a preliminary oil sketch for The World Before the Flood and purchased by the York Art Gallery. The two paintings were exhibited together as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work in 2011–12.|$|E
