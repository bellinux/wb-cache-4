The agreement shall help to promote NATO training of Afghan forces, a reconciliation and reintegration process for Taliban fighters who leave the battlefield, and regional stability with a focus on improving relations with Pakistan. The duration of the agreement is 10 years and requires from both parties to replace the current status of forces agreement with a bilateral security arrangement to be negotiated <b>within</b> <b>a</b> year. <b>Covered</b> <b>areas</b> under the agreement are military and security issues as well as assistance in building Afghanistan's economy and its democracy.

The laser line {{illuminates}} <b>a</b> detail <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by the imaging sensor, the area having a first dimension and a second dimension.

The laser emitter projects the laser line along the second dimension of the area at a position where a image frame is acquired. The imaging sensor is sensitive to laser reflections from the detail produced by the laser line. The imaging sensor images the laser reflections from the detail to generate the image frame. A computer having a pipeline structure is connected to the imaging sensor for reception of the image frame, and for computing the range to the detail using height, depression angle and/or offset.

40|$|Spatially {{distributed}} {{estimates of}} ecological variables are generally required {{for use in}} geographic information systems (GIS) and models when dealing with many environmental phenomena [2]. In particular, the quality of GIS products depends often on local properties that vary in space. In this context, increased interest has been demonstrated to geostatistics, or spatial statistics, as an analytical tool {{in the field of}} environmental sciences. Indeed, the problem of estimating local values of variables at unsampled sites <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by sample points, using the data from those points, {{is at the core of}} geostatistics [2]. The most common geostatistic tools involve kriging for data interpolation and mapping. Most methods to date have focused on the estimation, with the variogram, of the spatial autocorrelation structure used in kriging. <b>A</b> topic less <b>covered</b> concerns the use of different (non-Euclidean) measures for determining related inter-point distances. Some recent references include [1], [6] and [8]. This paper will investigate the use of the so-called geodesic distances for geostatistical related applications. Namely, using techniques derived from mathematical morphology in the field of image processing, new non-Euclidean distances are introduced while the definition of those proposed in previous studies are generalised. Geodesic distances enable both for characterizing isotropic spatial dependence and for taking account of natural barriers in heterogeneous domains. Algorithms described in [9, 10] are employed for computing the geodesic distances; the publicly available source code of [5] is employed to incorporate these non-euclidean distances into geostatistical algorithms.

40|$|The {{lineage of}} the Bar-backed Partridge (Arborophila brunneopectus) was {{investigated}} {{to determine the}} phylogenetic relationships within Arborophila as the species is centrally distributed <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by the distributions of 22 South-east Asian hill partridge species. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of A. brunneopectus was determined and compared with four other hill partridge species mitogenomes. NADH subunit genes are radical in hill partridge mitogenomes and contain the most potential positive selective sites around where variable sites are abundant. Together with 44 other mitogenomes of closely related species, we reconstructed highly resolved phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses and calculated the divergence and dispersal history of Arborophila using combined datasets composed of their 13 -protein coding sequences. Arborophila is reportedly be the oldest group in Phasianidae whose ancestors probably originated in Asia. A. rufipectus shares a closer relationship with A. ardens and A. brunneopectus compared to A. gingica and A. rufogularis, and such relationships were supported and profiled by NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND 5). The intragenus divergence of all five Arborophila species occurred in the Miocene (16. 84 ~ 5. 69 Mya) when there were periods of climate cooling. We propose that these cooling events in the Miocene forced hill partridges from higher to lower altitudes, which led to geographic isolation and speciation. We demonstrated that the apparently deleterious + 1 frameshift mutation in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND 3) found in all Arborophila is an ancient trait that has been eliminated in some younger lineages, such as Passeriformes. It is unclear of the biological advantages of this elimination for the relevant taxa and this requires further investigation...|$|R
30|$|The 2004 off the Kii Peninsula {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} September 5, 2004. Knowing the precise aftershock distribution {{is important for}} understanding the mechanism of this earthquake. However, the hypocenter of the main shock was located more than 100 km offshore from the nearest station of the land observation network. In the {{three days after the}} main shock, we started ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) observation {{in order to determine the}} precise distribution of the aftershocks. We assumed a seismic velocity structure for the hypocenter calculation, based on the results of previous seismic refraction study. The station corrections were incorporated to locate the hypocenter precisely. The hypocenters located <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by five OBSs show relatively small errors. It is found that the OBS-located hypocenters are located about 5.5 km east-southeast from those by JMA and the depth range of the aftershocks is about 5 – 25 km just beneath the Nankai trough axis. The aftershock hypocenters can be grouped into two clusters at different depths of about 10 km and about 20 km. It is inferred that the main shock also has a depth of 5 – 25 km. Since this extent of the main shock was larger than one of the oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate, the fault plane of the main shock extended at the upper most mantle of the Philippine Sea plate. Although we cannot assign the actual fault plane of the main shock form our observation results, it is clarified that intra-plate earthquakes occurred near the trench region. Our OBS result supports that the main shock was the earthquake not at the plate boundary but within the bending Philippine Sea plate near the trough axis.|$|R
