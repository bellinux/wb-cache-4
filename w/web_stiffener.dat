40|$|Composite bridges in Sweden are {{commonly}} {{designed as a}} twin I-girder section. To stablizie the bridge during launching and concreting horizontal cross bracings are used. These are normally connected to a transverse <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> that is welded with a throat size of 5 mm regardless of {{the dimensions of the}} bridge. During an inspection of Vårby Bridge south of Stockholm in 2006 cracks were found in this weld between the transverse <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> and the top flange. After discovering of these problems the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) wants the designer to present calculations for this weld. The aim of this thesis was to investigate and compare the stresses in the weld between the top flange and the transverse stiffener for different cross bracings. A finite element model of a typical composite bridge, with five different types of cross bracings, was investigated using the FE program Brigade Plus. A selection of loads including temperature-, traffic- and fatigue loads were considered. The thesis clearly shows that the design of cross bracings will affect the stress levels in the weld. ...|$|E
40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange section {{developed}} in Australia with a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. The LSB is subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling (LDB) mode when used as flexural members. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by cross sectional change due to web distortion. Lateral distortional buckling causes significant moment capacity reduction for LSBs with intermediate spans. Therefore a detailed investigation was undertaken to determine the methods of reducing the effects of lateral distortional buckling in LSB flexural members. For this purpose the use of web stiffeners was investigated using finite element analyses of LSBs with different <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> spacing and sizes.

The specimen {{is to examine the}} behavior of shear link by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400 mm of the steel profile of WF 200. 100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of shear link have been analyzed, namely flange and web thicknesses,, thickness and length of <b>web</b> <b>stiffener,</b> thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of shear link with diagonal <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> is capable to increase shear link performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility’s between shear links with diagonal stiffener and shear links based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant.

Experimental testing apparently has shown results of the same behavior as predicted in the numerical study. However, when it is compared to the shape of the hysterical curve, a slight difference is apparent. This is due to the influence of stiffness of bolt joints and the supports which is difficult to model precisely in the numerical studies...|$|E

The corrugated thin web is continuously welded to the flanges along the top and bottom edges. Trapezoid web beam is a built up section that able to support vertical loads over long spans.

Ordinarily, the economic design of steel web I-beam requires thin web. To avoid shear buckling, intermediate stiffener has to be used, or alternatively, the web can be made corrugated in trapezoidal profile.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} a number of {{unanswered}} questions regarding repair and fatigue design of welded joints in bridges, including developing and evaluating repair methods for enhancing the fatigue behaviour of web stiffeners in steel bridge girders, using local stress-based methods for evaluating the effectiveness of various repair methods and predicting the fatigue life of welded joints, and studying the effectiveness of high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatments under actual in-service loading conditions in the long fatigue life regime. Along with extensive fatigue testing programs and finite element (FE) analyse studies, a strain based fracture mechanics (SBFM) model is used to predict the fatigue behaviour of repaired welds under realistic loading conditions. Through this research, a methodology is developed for generating structural stress design curves for retrofitted highway bridge welds based on small-scale fatigue experiments, relatively simple and inexpensive fatigue tests of smooth specimens, conventional static materials tests, and laboratory measurements. The idea of retrofitting <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> ends in steel bridge girders susceptible to distortion-induced fatigue using adhesively-bonded fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) angles is introduced through this research. The proposed retrofit method is relatively cheap {{and easy to use}} and does not require deck removal or any other severe modification to the steel girder. Fatigue tests were conducted on specimens designed to model the conditions in the region between a <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> and a flange in a steel girder bridge. Fatigue life increases on the order of several hundred percent were achieved by implementing the proposed retrofit. A coarse FE analysis is used to predict the effectiveness of the proposed retrofit methods in terms of the reduction in the structural stress value. A comprehensive variable amplitude (VA) fatigue testing program and analysis was performed {{to address a}} number of concerns raised regarding the use of impact treatments for the fatigue enhancement of welds in the high cycle (> 10 million cycles) domain. The test results are then used to evaluate a number of available recommendations for the fatigue design of impact treated welds. The nominal, structural, and effective notch stress approaches are considered. An SBFM model was lastly used to predict the effectiveness of an HFMI treatment applied to welded details. The model is evaluated using the experimental results and found to be capable of predicting the fatigue lives for both the as-welded and impact treated specimens for all of the studied loading conditions. The idea of using the analytical structural stress S-N curves to predict the fatigue behaviour of welded joints with a similar load carrying condition welds was then explored...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} efficiency, lightweight, ease of {{erection}} and low cost, steel and aluminium thin-walled structures {{have become very}} popular {{in the construction industry}} over the past few decades. Applications include roof and wall systems (purlins and girts), storage racks, and composite concrete and steel slabs. The effectiveness of these structures lies in the cross-sectional shape of the profiles which enhances their strength by controlling the three fundamental buckling modes: local, distortional, and global. However, despite the attractiveness of these structures, steel and aluminium are greenhouse gas intensive materials and do not produce sustainable structural products. This paper presents an investigation performed at the Griffith School of Engineering, Griffith University, which shows manufacturing these types of profiles in timber is possible.

30|$|A brief {{review of}} {{literature}} on the ultimate strength and buckling modes of web stiffened cold formed steel channel column with various types of edge stiffeners are presented here. Kwon and Hancock (1992) {{was the first to}} publish a paper describing the interaction between local and distortional buckling of the intermediate cold-formed steel thin-walled sections. Very recently, the interactive behaviour of lipped channel columns with and without intermediate web stiffeners has fascinated several researchers. Young and Yan (2002) and Yan and Young (2002) discussed local and distortional buckling of plain channel with upright and complex edge stiffener under axial compression. Experimental investigations on stiffened lipped channels by Yang and Hancock (2004), by Yap and Hancock (2008) on an complex high-strength cold-formed cross-shaped steel column, by Kwon et al. (2009) on an cold-formed simple lipped channels and lipped channels with intermediate stiffeners in the flanges and web, by Yap and Hancock (2011) on an web-stiffened high strength steel cold-formed lipped channel columns. Local-distortional buckling mode interactions of lipped channel columns were discussed by Young et al. (2013), He et al. (2014) Martins et al. (2015) and Manikandan and Arun (2016). Local, distortional and flexural interaction of channels column were reported by Dinis and Camotim (2011) and Wang et al. (2016).

40|$|Structures {{have always}} been {{subjected}} to the detrimental consequences of the fatigue phenomenon. The consequences due to this damaging effects leads to crack initiation and the ultimate result being complete failure. Fatigue appears on structures that has to endure fluctuating loads over a long period. The crack initiation occurs irregular geometries {{such as in the}} vicinity of welds and bolts. A structure that suffers a lot due to fatigue are road bridges. In this thesis the structure under investigation is a composite bridge with a concrete slab on top of two I-girders. The recommended lifetime of road bridges in the Eurocode is 100 years. Bridges are exposed to daily and yearly traffic loads. Also the amount of traffic and therefore the total weight shows a continuously increasing trend over the years. This tendency is under no circumstances expected to stagnate. Eurocode has based its approach to verification of fatigue on applying adversely combined traffic loads, in both directions, on the bridge. In the procedure of double I-girder composite bridges verification there is an uneven distribution of the vehicle loads and the stresses, as the bridge is behaving as an open cross-section. The concrete slab is the only apparent part that is transferring the vehicle loads to the other girder and gives therefore an unequal distribution of the loads. Because of this uneven load distribution there appears to exist some potential in finding a means to strengthen the bridge by ways of making it work as a semi-closed cross-section. This will enhance the load distribution over to the non-stressed girder. In this thesis the focus was set on the stress relation between the center <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> to the lower flange, with and without the strengthening, for a real case section. Assessment were done for case studies where the Rokån bridge as well as four arbitrary cross-sections were investigated in search of retrieving an increased understanding of the mechanism of stress distribution. The strengthening approach is to introduce a truss assembly, in shape of a K, in the plane between the two I-girders bottom flanges. This approach reduced the stresses in the middle position of the Rokån bridge by approximately 8. 3 %. In addition, the parametric study of the arbitrary cross-sections, with the same truss system, where made. Reductions there showed stress values in the interval of 5. 9 % and 16. 6 %. Based on this study it was found {{that it is possible to}} establish a relation between the length on the bridge and the distance, w, between the girders. With regards to this study in applying this K-bracing, indicates that given stress reductions can prolong the bridges technical life to about 2. 5 times. In comparison to strengthening ways available on the market, such as CFRP sheets and an additional concrete slab, there are advantages and disadvantages, such as self-weight, total cost, new fatigue details and the most important stress reduction. While the reductions tends to be quite high, there still exists a FE-model uncertainty regarding the coupling between the K-bracing junctions and the bottom flanges where the fusion of the elements was done with a node to node attachment. In a reality attaching the K-bracing onto the flange will be done by means of a bolted, welded or friction connection, which may lead to another fatigue category and increased/decreased stress concentrations at the new joints...|$|E
40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange {{channel section}} {{developed}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills using a patented Dual Electric Resistance Welding technique. The LSB has a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. It is commonly used as rafters, floor joists and bearers and roof beams in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. It is on average 40 % lighter than traditional hot-rolled steel beams of equivalent performance. The LSB flexural members are subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling mode, which reduces the member moment capacity. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling of steel beams, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Current member moment capacity design rules for lateral distortional buckling in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) {{do not include the}} effect of section geometry of hollow flange beams although its effect is considered to be important. Therefore detailed experimental and finite element analyses (FEA) were carried out to investigate the lateral distortional buckling behaviour of LSBs including the effect of section geometry. The results showed that the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) are over-conservative in the inelastic lateral buckling region. New improved design rules were therefore developed for LSBs based on both FEA and experimental results. A geometrical parameter (K) defined as the ratio of the flange torsional rigidity to the major axis flexural rigidity of the web (GJf/EIxweb) was identified as the critical parameter affecting the lateral distortional buckling of hollow flange beams. The effect of section geometry was then included in the new design rules using the new parameter (K). The new design rule developed by including this parameter was found to be accurate in calculating the member moment capacities of not only LSBs, but also other types of hollow flange steel beams such as Hollow Flange Beams (HFBs), Monosymmetric Hollow Flange Beams (MHFBs) and Rectangular Hollow Flange Beams (RHFBs). The inelastic reserve bending capacity of LSBs has not been investigated yet although the section moment capacity tests of LSBs in the past revealed that inelastic reserve bending capacity is present in LSBs. However, the Australian and American cold-formed steel design codes limit them to the first yield moment. Therefore both experimental and FEA were carried out to investigate the section moment capacity behaviour of LSBs. A comparison of the section moment capacity results from FEA, experiments and current cold-formed steel design codes showed that compact and non-compact LSB sections classified based on AS 4100 (SA, 1998) have some inelastic reserve capacity while slender LSBs do not have any inelastic reserve capacity beyond their first yield moment. It was found that Shifferaw and Schafer’s (2008) proposed equations and Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006) design equations can be used to include the inelastic bending capacities of compact and non-compact LSBs in design. As a simple design approach, the section moment capacity of compact LSB sections can be taken as 1. 10 times their first yield moment while it is the first yield moment for non-compact sections. For slender LSB sections, current cold-formed steel codes can be used to predict their section moment capacities. It was believed that the use of transverse web stiffeners could improve the lateral distortional buckling moment capacities of LSBs. However, currently there are no design equations to predict the elastic lateral distortional buckling and member moment capacities of LSBs with web stiffeners under uniform moment conditions. Therefore, a detailed study was conducted using FEA to simulate both experimental and ideal conditions of LSB flexural members. It was shown that the use of 3 to 5 mm steel plate stiffeners welded or screwed to the inner faces of the top and bottom flanges of LSBs at third span points and supports provided an optimum <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> arrangement. Suitable design rules were developed to calculate the improved elastic buckling and ultimate moment capacities of LSBs with these optimum web stiffeners. A design rule using the geometrical parameter K was also developed to improve the accuracy of ultimate moment capacity predictions. This thesis presents the details and results of the experimental and numerical studies of the section and member moment capacities of LSBs conducted in this research. It includes the recommendations made regarding the accuracy of current design rules as well as the new design rules for lateral distortional buckling. The new design rules include the effects of section geometry of hollow flange steel beams. This thesis also developed a method of using web stiffeners to reduce the lateral distortional buckling effects, and associated design rules to calculate the improved moment capacities...|$|E
40|$|LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{steel beam}} {{produced}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills. The new beam is effectively a channel section with two rectangular hollow flanges and a slender web, and is manufactured using a combined cold-forming and electric resistance welding process. OneSteel Australian Tube Mills is promoting the use of LSBs as flexural members {{in a range of}} applications, such as floor bearers. When LSBs are used as back to back built-up sections, they are likely to improve their moment capacity and thus extend their applications further. However, the structural behaviour of built-up beams is not well understood. Many steel design codes include guidelines for connecting two channels to form a built-up I-section including the required longitudinal spacing of connections. But these rules were found to be inadequate in some applications. Currently the safe spans of builtup beams are determined based on twice the moment capacity of a single section. Research has shown that these guidelines are conservative. Therefore large scale lateral buckling tests and advanced numerical analyses were undertaken to investigate the flexural behaviour of back to back LSBs connected by fasteners (bolts) at various longitudinal spacings under uniform moment conditions. In this research an experimental investigation was first undertaken to study the flexural behaviour of back to back LSBs including its buckling characteristics. This experimental study included tensile coupon tests, initial geometric imperfection measurements and lateral buckling tests. The initial geometric imperfection measurements taken on several back to back LSB specimens showed that the back to back bolting process is not likely to alter the imperfections, and the measured imperfections are well below the fabrication tolerance limits. Twelve large scale lateral buckling tests were conducted to investigate the behaviour of back to back built-up LSBs with various longitudinal fastener spacings under uniform moment conditions. Tests also included two single LSB specimens. Test results showed that the back to back LSBs gave higher moment capacities in comparison with single LSBs, and the fastener spacing influenced the ultimate moment capacities. As the fastener spacing was reduced the ultimate moment capacities of back to back LSBs increased. Finite element models of back to back LSBs with varying fastener spacings were then developed to conduct a detailed parametric study on the flexural behaviour of back to back built-up LSBs. Two finite element models were developed, namely experimental and ideal finite element models. The models included the complex contact behaviour between LSB web elements and intermittently fastened bolted connections along the web elements. They were validated by comparing their results with experimental results and numerical results obtained from an established buckling analysis program called THIN-WALL. These comparisons showed that the developed models could accurately predict both the elastic lateral distortional buckling moments and the non-linear ultimate moment capacities of back to back LSBs. Therefore the ideal finite element models incorporating ideal simply supported boundary conditions and uniform moment conditions were used in a detailed parametric study on the flexural behaviour of back to back LSB members. In the detailed parametric study, both elastic buckling and nonlinear analyses of back to back LSBs were conducted for 13 LSB sections with varying spans and fastener spacings. Finite element analysis results confirmed that the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) are very conservative while the new design rules developed by Anapayan and Mahendran (2009 a) for single LSB members were also found to be conservative. Thus new member capacity design rules were developed for back to back LSB members as a function of non-dimensional member slenderness. New empirical equations were also developed to aid in the calculation of elastic lateral distortional buckling moments of intermittently fastened back to back LSBs. Design guidelines were developed for the maximum fastener spacing of back to back LSBs in order to optimise the use of fasteners. A closer fastener spacing of span/ 6 was recommended for intermediate spans and some long spans where the influence of fastener spacing was found to be high. In the last phase of this research, a detailed investigation was conducted to investigate the potential use of different types of connections and stiffeners in improving the flexural strength of back to back LSB members. It was found that using transverse web stiffeners was the most cost-effective and simple strengthening method. It is recommended that web stiffeners are used at the supports and every third points within the span, and their thickness is in the range of 3 to 5 mm {{depending on the size of}} LSB section. The use of web stiffeners eliminated most of the lateral distortional buckling effects and hence improved the ultimate moment capacities. A suitable design equation was developed to calculate the elastic lateral buckling moments of back to back LSBs with the above recommended <b>web</b> <b>stiffener</b> configuration while the same design rules developed for unstiffened back to back LSBs were recommended to calculate the ultimate moment capacities...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{structural}} behaviour of cold-formed steel built-up compression members with longitudinal stiffeners was investigated by experiments and numerical simulation. The influence of different screw spacings on the ultimate strengths of built-up compression members was also investigated. In current design specifications, generally {{there are no}} direct and explicit design rules for cold-formed steel built-up sections. Therefore, design rules for built-up open sections and closed sections have been proposed. The test program was conducted for cold-formed steel built-up sections, which were compressed axially between fixed ends with various column lengths ranged from 300 to 3200 mm. Two identical open sections were connected by self-tapping screws to form a built-up section. The material properties and initial geometric imperfections of the test specimens were measured. The experimental investigation consisted of built-up open sections with edge and <b>web</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> and built-up closed sections with inward or outward <b>web</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> In total, 47 specimens were tested with a screw spacing of 100 mm, and another 25 specimens were tested with screw spacings of 300 and 600 mm. A further investigation on {{the structural}} behaviour of cold-formed steel built-up compression members was performed using finite element analysis (FEA). Firstly, accurate and reliable finite element models (FEMs) were developed and verified against the test results. Secondly, extensive parametric studies of cross-section geometry and the screw spacing were {{carried out by the}} verified FEMs. The parametric study contained 442 specimens for built-up open sections, built-up closed sections, and built-up sections with different screw spacings. Therefore, the complex structural behaviour of built-up compression members with edge and <b>web</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> together with different spacings of self-tapping screws were studied thoroughly, as reported in this thesis. The current direct strength method (DSM) is a favored design method for cold-formed steel columns and beams due to its ease of calculation. However, DSM does not cover the design of cold-formed steel built-up sections. The appropriateness of DSM for cold-formed steel built-up compression members was accessed by both experimental and numerical investigation. It was found that the current DSM is not quite suitable for the design of built-up compression members. Therefore, the current DSM was modified for built-up open and closed sections. The results show that the modified design rules are generally conservative and reliable for the design of built-up compression members. In addition, design recommendations are proposed for built-up sections with different screw spacings. The reliability of the current and modified design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed {{steel channel}} {{sections}} are increasingly used as flexural {{members in the}} construction industry. Improved section profiles such as SupaCee sections are also available for use instead of the conventional lipped channel beam (LCB) sections. They contain additional longitudinal <b>web</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and special return lips that enhance their bending and shear capacities. Web crippling capacities of these innovative sections {{are different from those}} of LCBs due to the difference in section geometry. However, no investigation has been conducted into the web crippling behaviour and strength of these high strength SupaCee sections. Current design equations (AISI S 100 and AS/NZS 4600) do not include any design procedures for such sections with special longitudinal <b>web</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and lips. Hence an experimental study was first conducted to assess the web crippling behaviour and strengths of conventional LCBs and SupaCees under different loading conditions. Seventy two tests of LCB and SupaCee sections were conducted under two flange load cases (ETF and ITF load cases). Comparison of ultimate web crippling capacities showed that the web crippling capacities of SupaCee sections are reduced in comparison to LCB sections. Therefore suitable modifications to the current AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design equations were made by proposing different web crippling coefficients for SupeCee sections. Numerical models were also developed and validated using the experimental results, and were then used in numerical parametric studies. This paper presents the details of the experimental and numerical studies of LCBs and SupaCees subject to web crippling under ETF and ITF load cases. Suitable web crippling design rules were also developed under the direct strength method format...|$|R
40|$|Bolted beam-column {{connections}} {{are a common}} moment connection used {{in the design of}} steel buildings. Existing design guides include design parameters for bolt configurations having one bolt {{on either side of the}} beam web for each row of bolts. There is potential for increasing connection strength by adding additional bolts on the outside of these rows. This addition could be useful in retrofit scenarios, or even in the design of new structures. In this research, finite element analysis is used to analyze various beam-column connections and t-stub connections. The modeling methods, research process, and conclusions are explained in the thesis paper. The primary goal was to determine the usefulness of adding addition bolts to these connections, along with the effect of other components such as column <b>web</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> and extended endplates...|$|R

Experimental results are presented for element specimens with a single stiffener and for panel specimens with three stiffeners. Response and failure characteristics of the specimens are described. Effects of impact damage on structural response for both specimen configurations are also presented. Experimental results indicate that impact location may significantly affect the residual strength of the Y-stiffened specimens.

40|$|Existing design {{methods for}} <b>web</b> <b>{{stiffener}}s</b> differ widely in concept {{and in the}} stiffener size which results. An investigation has been conducted to provide a rational, usable and validated design method for transverse stiffeners. The proposed design method takes account of the axial compression in stiffeners caused by tension field action and external forces, the transverse forces on the stiffeners required to enforce effective division of the web plate, and the tendency for the stiffened plate to buckle overall. Design criteria are established {{to ensure that the}} resulting stiffeners do not yield before plate failure, and that the plating is effectively divided into panels. The transverse stiffener dimensions required by the proposed design model have been validated against finite element results for plates subjected to pure shear, and to combined shear and direct in-plane loading. Finally, the stiffener sizes are compared with those required by the existing methods...|$|R

In the case of wider flange width, the local buckling of flange in compressive side was observed.
