40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{detection}} of <b>wipes</b> and their frame ranges {{is important for}} the purpose of reliable video parsing and video database indexing. <b>Wipes</b> are difficult to detect because of the complexity and variety of the transition effects. Many of the existing <b>wipe</b> detection algorithms could detect only a few <b>wipe</b> effects. The false/miss detection problem caused by motion is also very serious. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>wipe</b> detection algorithm that can detect most <b>wipe</b> effects with accurate frame ranges. We carefully model a <b>wipe</b> based on its nature and then use the model to filter out possible confusion caused by motion or other transition effects. More precisely, properties of independence and completeness are proposed to characterize an ideal wipe; frame ranges of potential <b>wipes</b> are located by finding sequences which are a close approximation to an ideal <b>wipe.</b> Bayes rule is applied to each potential <b>wipe</b> to statistically estimate an adaptive threshold for the purpose of <b>wipe</b> verification. Experiment results on videos with different genres show that the proposed methodology can be used to detect various <b>wipe</b> effects effectively.

40|$|Background: Hospital-acquired infections {{associated}} with Clostridium difficile cause severe morbidity and mortality. The current control of C difficile endospores with liquid sporicides might have limited efficacy {{in the health}} care environment. Sporicidal <b>wipes</b> might offer additional control of surface bioburden and are now increasingly used, although there is little information about their efficacy against spores in practice. Methods: Ten <b>wipes</b> were tested for sporicidal efficacy using a recently developed 3 -stage protocol that measures the ability of the <b>wipe</b> to remove microbial bioburden from a surface, the potential for microbial transfer from the <b>wipe</b> to other surfaces, and the sporicidal activity of the <b>wipe.</b> Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the association of spores with the <b>wipe</b> fibers, and light scattering was used to measure the size of spore aggregates released from the <b>wipes.</b> Results: The ability of the sporicidal <b>wipes</b> to remove C difficile spores from an inanimate surface ranged from 0. 22 to 4. 09 log 10 spores removed within 10 seconds. One <b>wipe</b> did not remove any spores. None of the <b>wipes</b> demonstrated high sporicidal activity (ie, > 4 log 10 reduction) within 5 minutes of contact time, except for a control <b>wipe</b> soaked in 5, 000 -ppm sodium hypochlorite. Only one <b>wipe</b> demonstrated some sporicidal activity after 5 minutes, with a 1. 50 and a 3. 74 log 10 reduction in spore number of C difficile NCTC 12727 and R 20291 (ribotype 027), respectively. All but one <b>wipe</b> demonstrated that spores could be repeatedly transferred to other surfaces. Light-scattering data provided evidence that some <b>wipes</b> were able to break up spore aggregates, potentially releasing more spores onto the surface. Electron microscopy micrographs showed that spores might be loosely {{associated with}} some <b>wipes,</b> explaining the rapid release. Conclusion: Although the use of sporicidal <b>wipes</b> might offer additional control of microbial burden on surfaces, current efficacy tests might be inadequate to reflect the activity of these <b>wipes</b> in practice. This can lead to the use of <b>wipes</b> that might not be appropriate for applications {{in the health care}} environment. Tighter control of labeling and appropriate efficacy tests are needed before antimicrobial <b>wipes</b> are released to the market...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of different <b>wipe</b> effects, <b>wipe</b> transition is considered complex and difficult to detect. This paper identifies two common characteristics of different <b>wipes,</b> which can be described by two principles – independence and completeness.

Since no pre-determined values would be appropriate for different videos, we propose using a dynamic method to generate adaptive thresholds for <b>wipe</b> detection.

40|$|This {{research}} compared three <b>wipe</b> sampling techniques {{currently used}} to test for beryllium contamination on room and equipment surfaces in Department of Energy facilities. Efficiencies of removal of beryllium contamination from typical painted surfaces were tested by <b>wipe</b> sampling without a wetting agent, with water-moistened <b>wipe</b> materials, and by methanol-moistened <b>wipes.</b> Analysis indicated that methanol-moistened <b>wipe</b> sampling removed about twice as much beryllium/oil-film surface contamination as water-moistened <b>wipes,</b> which removed about twice as much residue as dry <b>wipes.</b> Criteria at 10 CFR 850. 30 and. 31 were established on unspecified <b>wipe</b> sampling method(s). The {{results of this study}} reveal a need to identify criteria-setting method and equivalency factors. As facilities change <b>wipe</b> sampling methods among the three compared in this study, these results may be useful for approximate correlations. Accurate decontamination decision-making depends on the selection of appropriate wetting agents for the types of residues and surfaces. Evidence for beryllium sensitization via skin exposure argues in favor of <b>wipe</b> sampling with wetting agents that provide enhanced removal efficiency such as methanol when surface contamination includes oil mist residue...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wipe</b> {{transition}} detection {{in video}} segmentation {{is more difficult}} to detect than abrupt and other gradual transitions, because of diversity in patterns, and difficulty in distinguishing <b>wipe</b> from camera and object motion. In this study, the authors propose an algorithm for <b>wipe</b> transition detection.

In order to decrease the computational load of the proposed algorithm, the authors propose a preprocessing step as a first stage of the algorithm. The preprocessing step consists of calculation of statistical image difference between the consecutive frames to obtain the potential <b>wipe</b> frames, which are input to their proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm detects and identifies various types of <b>wipes</b> and also distinguishes <b>wipes</b> from object and camera motion.
