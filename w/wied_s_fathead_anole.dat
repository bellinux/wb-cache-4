40|$|It was {{recently}} shown by Hansen that the Wigner-Yanase entropy is, for general states of quantum systems, not subadditive {{with respect to}} decomposition into two subsystems, although this property is known to hold for pure states. We investigate the question whether the weaker property of subadditivity for pure states with respect to decomposition into more than two subsystems holds. This property would have interesting applications in quantum chemistry. We show, however, {{that it does not}} hold in general, and provide a counterexample. In 1963, Wigner and Yanase [4] introduced the entropy-like quantity <b>S</b> <b>WY</b> (ρ, K) = 1 2 Tr[ρ 1 / 2, K] 2 = Trρ 1 / 2 Kρ 1 / 2 K − TrρK 2 for density matrices ρ of quantum systems, with K some fixed self-adjoint operator.

40|$|Recently, Narayan, Garcia and McClintock {{showed that}} there is a {{difference}} in the quiescent luminosities of black hole and neutron star x-ray nova: when the quiescent, Eddington scaled luminosities are compared, every black hole x-ray nova (BHXN) is fainter than every the neutron star x-ray nova (NSXN). To this earlier work we add three more BHXN, GRO J 1655 - 40, GRO J 0422 + 32, and 4 U 1543 - 47. This increases the significance of the difference between the quiescent luminosities to the > 99 % level. Given the reasonable assumption that the (Eddington scaled) mass transfer swings in BHXN and NSXN are similar, this difference provides direct evidence for the existence of event horizons in the BHXN: they have larger luminosity swings because the quiescent mass transfer energy is being hidden behind the event horizon.

40|$|Scientists {{participating}} in the USGS Abandoned Minelands Initiative have quantified metal concentrations and loadings from mining-related and natural background sources in the upper Animas River of southwestern Colorado, {{with the goal of}} guiding remediation decisions by federal land-management agencies. We have compared site-specific toxicity thresholds with frequencies of dissolved metal concentrations in stream water to evaluate the contributions of zinc and copper to toxic effects in fish and aquatic invertebrates in the upper Animas. Median lethal concentrations (LC 50 s) of zinc and copper were determined for fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, and amphipods, Hyalella azteca, from seven-day toxicity tests under water quality conditions typical of the upper Animas. Frequency analysis based on hysteresis models was used to predict seasonal occurrence and daily probabilities of dissolved zinc and copper concentrations at two gaging stations near Silverton, Colorado. Results of these analyses indicate that dissolved zinc concentrations at both locations frequently exceed 7 -day LC 50 s for amphipods, and occasionally exceed zinc LC 50 <b>s</b> for <b>fathead</b> minnows. In contrast, copper concentrations rarely approach lethal levels for either species. Model results are consistent with recent on-site toxicity tests with these two species. Comparison of modeled zinc and copper concentrations with published toxicity thresholds for brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, suggest that both zinc and copper contribute to chronic toxicity in resident trout in the upper Animas...|$|R

40|$|Alicyclic bicyclic acids {{have been}} {{reported}} to be the major naphthenic acids (NA) in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) but due to the extreme complexity of OSPW none have yet been identified. A previous study using the Microtox ™ assay indicated that some synthetic alicyclic bicyclics were the most acutely toxic acids tested so it is important that these compounds are identified and their toxicities determined. Using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) we show that> 100 C 8 - 15 bicyclic acids are typically present in OSPW. Synthesis or purchase facilitated GCxGC retention times of methyl esters of these acids to be established and their mass spectra compared with unknowns. Having identified numerous alicyclic bicyclic acids by comparison with authentic standards, we suggest that many of the remaining unknowns are simply analogues of the identified acids with longer alkanoate chains and/or alkyl substituents. Previously we reported the predicted toxicities of a range of NA, many of which had been identified in OSPW, but the alicyclic bicyclic acid structures modelled had only been found in commercial NA mixtures or crude oil. Now, having identified numerous novel acids, we report their toxicities to Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow), the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis and the water flea Daphnia magna as predicted by Admet Predictor ™ (Simulations Plus). Also, neural network ensemble models were used to assess a compound's likelihood of binding to the estrogen or androgen receptors. Furthermore, the persistence of NA is a huge problem for the oil sands extraction industries so the likelihood of biodegradation was also modelled. Predicted LC 50 <b>s</b> for <b>fathead</b> minnows and water fleas were in the range 0. 01 – 3. 54 mmol/L and EC 50 s for T. pyriformis 0. 01 – 0. 7 mmol/L. As expected for this type of structure, no binding affinities for either estrogen or androgen receptors were predicted. Of the structures tested, about 30 % were considered not readily biodegradable as defined by the model based on biological oxygen demand and theoretical oxygen demand. Structures with terminal branches were least likely to readily biodegrade...|$|R
40|$|As fish cell {{cultures}} {{continue to}} be explored as alternatives to whole fish for evaluating the toxicity of environment chemicals, technical issues have emerged that influence results and thus need to be understood and standardized. These include carrier solvents, dosing protocols, exposure vessel, exposure media, viability endpoints, and cell lines. Some of these factors have been explored in this thesis for eight reactive contaminants exhibiting varied physicochemical properties using the rainbow trout cell lines RTgill-W 1 and RTL-W 1. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) {{was used as a}} reference (control) chemical. Cell viability was evaluated with alamar Blue, carboxyfluoroscein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester and neutral red as measures respectively of metabolic activity, plasma membrane integrity, and lysosomal function. Experimental in vitro EC 50 values were compared to 1) pre-existing in vivo LC 50 <b>s</b> from the <b>fathead</b> minnow database and 2) pre-existing in vitro EC 50 s from the Halle database. Results point to good in vitro/in vivo correlations for menadione, dichlorophene, hexachlorophene, and acrolein. Poor correlations were observed for allyl alcohol, 4 -fluoroaniline, acetaldehyde, and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene due to a combination of solubility and volatility problems. Overall, the results suggest that the impact of different technical approaches on the evaluation of acute toxicity in vitro depends very much on the chemical class being investigated and less on the characteristics of the cell line. The in vitro cytotoxicity of reactive chemicals is challenging {{due to the nature of}} the chemicals’ physicochemical properties. Further improving the in vitro toxicity of reactive chemicals is a prerequisite for the ultimate goal of using fish cell cultures as acceptable, standard alternatives to the use of fish acute lethality assays...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{synthetic}} phosphoinositolglycan (PIG) compounds {{has been demonstrated}} to exert insulin-mimetic activity on glucose and lipid metabolism in rat adipocytes differing considerably in potency [compound 41 > 37 > 45 >> 7 > 1; W. Frick, A. Bauer, J. Bauer, <b>S.</b> <b>Wied</b> and G. Müller, G. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 13421 - 13436]. In the present study we examine whether these differences {{are based on the}} capability of the PIG compounds to stimulate signalling components which are thought to mediate metabolic insulin action. Studies using a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and introduction into adipocytes of anti-phosphotyrosine or inhibitory anti-insulin receptor beta-subunit antibodies demonstrated dependence on tyrosine phosphorylation but independence of insulin receptor kinase activation of the insulin-mimetic signalling and metabolic activity of the PIG compounds. The five compounds elicited in rat adipocytes a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS- 1) and IRS- 3 and, to a minor degree, IRS- 2, in IRS- 1 / 3 -associated phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) protein as well as activity, and in protein kinase B (PKB) activity as well as phosphorylation. This was most pronounced for compound 41, approaching 65 - 95 % of the maximal insulin response (MIR) at 20 microM, and declined in the order of compounds 37, 45, 7 and 1. The same ranking was true for the maximal inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity (GSK- 3) (41, 75 % of MIR; compound 37, 65 %; compound 7, 25 %; compound 1, 10 %) and GSK- 3 autophosphorylation. The half-maximal concentrations effective for signalling (compound 41, 2 - 5 microM; compound 37, 10 - 20 microM) corresponded well to those stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, compounds 37 and 41 stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein synthesis in rat adipocytes to only about 20 - 30 % (at 50 microM) of MIR. We conclude that in rat adipocytes: (i) the potency of PIG compounds to regulate glucose/lipid metabolism depends on the activation of PI 3 -K and PKB and inhibition of GSK- 3; (ii) initiation of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS- 1 / 3 is sufficient and activation of the PI 3 -K cascade is required for insulin-mimetic metabolic signalling; and (iii) PIG compounds are quite selective for the PI 3 -K compared to the MAPK cascade, (iv) PIG compounds seem to use the same signalling components downstream of PI 3 -K (including Rab 4) for stimulation of glucose transport as does insulin. Thus the early signalling step(s) used by PIG, but not by insulin, may represent a target for the treatment of insulin-resistant states...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Female sexual {{dysfunction}} (FSD) {{is a highly}} prevalent sexual health problem but poorly investigated at the primary care level. Aim. This article examines the prevalence of {{sexual dysfunction}} and its possible risk factors associated with women {{at high risk of}} FSD in a hospital-based primary practice. Methods. A validated Malay version of the Female Sexual Function Index (MVFSFI) was utilized to determine FSD in a cross-sectional study design, involving 163 married women, aged 18 - 65 years, in a tertiary hospital-based primary care clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Sociodemographic, marital profile, health, and lifestyle for women at high risk of FSD and those who were not at high risk were compared and their risk factors were determined. Main Outcome Measures. Prevalence of FSD in Malaysian women based on the MVFSFI, and its risk factors for developing FSD. Results. Some 42 (25. 8 %) out of 163 women had sexual dysfunction. Prevalence of sexual dysfunction increased significantly with age. Sexual dysfunctions were detected as desire problem (39. 3 %), arousal problem (25. 8 %), lubrication problem (21. 5 %), orgasm problem (16. 6 %), satisfaction problem (21. 5 %) and pain problems (16. 6 %). Women at high risk of FSD were significantly associated with age (OR 4. 1, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 9. 0), husband's age (OR 4. 3 95 % C. I 1. 9 to 9. 3), duration of marriage (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 6. 8), medical problems (OR 8. 5, 95 % CI 3. 3 to 21. 7), menopausal status (OR 6. 6, 95 % CI 3. 1 to 14. 3), and frequency of sexual intercourse (OR 10. 7, 95 % CI 3. 6 to 31. 7). Multivariate analysis showed that medical problem (adjusted OR 4. 6, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 14. 0) and frequency of sexual intercourse (adjusted OR 7. 2, 95 % CI 2. 1 to 24. 0) were associated with increased risk of having FSD. Those who practiced contraception were less likely to have FSD. Conclusion. Sexual health problems are prevalent in women attending primary care clinic where one in four women were at high risk of FSD. Thus, primary care physician should be trained and prepared to address this issue.
