5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind.|$|E

25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

500|$|The visa {{situation}} was sorted out by Bandi Grosz {{and the men}} were taken to a hotel, where they met the Jewish Agency delegates. Brand was furious that no one sufficiently senior was available to negotiate a deal. The Jewish Agency agreed to arrange for Moshe Sharett (previously Shertok), head of its political department and later second prime minister of Israel, to travel to Istanbul to meet him. Brand passed them a plan of Auschwitz (probably from the Vrba-Wetzler report) and demanded that the gas chambers, crematoria and railways lines be bombed. The discussions left him discouraged and depressed. He wrote that the delegates lacked any sense of urgency and were focused more on internal politics and Jewish emigration to Palestine, rather than the slaughter in Europe: [...] " [...] were undoubtedly worthy men...But they lacked any awareness of how critical was the period of history {{in which they were}} living. They had not looked death in the face day after day, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> Budapest..." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Solidarity {{had been}} {{transforming}} itself from a trade union into a social movement or more specifically, a revolutionary movement. Over the 500 {{days following the}} Gdańsk Agreement, 9–10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations, such as the Independent Student Union (Niezależne Zrzeszenie Studentów, created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union (NSZZ Rolników Indywidualnych [...] "Solidarność" [...] or Rural Solidarity, created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union. It {{was the only time}} in recorded history that a quarter of a country's population (some 80% of the total Polish work force) had voluntarily joined a single organization. [...] "History has taught us that there is no bread without freedom," [...] the Solidarity program stated a year later. [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind was not only bread, butter and sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the repair of the republic."

In the final cut of the film, however, most of the music was chosen by Sollett, editor Myron Kerstein and music supervisor Linda Cohen. Sollett said that he [...] "got lucky" [...] with the songs {{that he was able}} to choose because, within the financiers and the studio, [...] "there was nobody in that group who knew all that much about music or the music that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the film". His objective when selecting the music was to find [...] "the best music you haven't heard yet", primarily from bands based in New York City. While filming in New York, he emailed songs [...] "right out of my iTunes [...] " [...] which he thought would suit particular scenes to Kerstein, who was in Los Angeles assembling the film as it was shot.|$|E
