5|$|The PS90 is a carbine {{version of}} the P90, {{intended}} for civilian shooters for personal protection and sporting use; it was introduced in 2005, {{and continues to be}} offered in several configurations. The PS90 <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> standard 50-round P90 magazines, but the gun is supplied with a magazine that is blocked to a capacity of 10 or 30 rounds, allowing it to be sold in jurisdictions where magazine capacities are restricted by law.|$|E
5|$|The troublemaker Bricriu once incites three heroes, Cú Chulainn, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach, {{to compete}} for the champion's portion at his feast. In every test that is set Cú Chulainn comes out top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> result. Cú Roí mac Dáire of Munster settles it by visiting each {{in the guise of a}} hideous churl and {{challenging}} them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and Lóegaire both behead Cú Roí, who picks up his head and leaves, but when the time comes for him to return they flee. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to Cú Roí's axe; Cú Roí spares him and he is declared champion. This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Other examples include the 13th century French Life of Caradoc and the English romances The Turke and Gowin, and Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle.|$|E

The barrel has a slotted flash suppressor with 6 ports {{and can be used}} to launch rifle grenades (such as the BT/AT 52) or mount a bayonet lug attachment (it <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> M7 bayonet).|$|E

This means only {{that the government will}} give the holder of the notes new federal reserve notes in exchange for the note (or <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> old notes as payments for debts owed to the federal government). The government is not obligated to redeem the notes for gold or silver, even if the note itself states that it is so redeemable. Some bills may have a premium to collectors.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E

500|$|Mosley won {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the FIA on 3 June 2008, with 103 votes in support and 55 against, with seven abstentions and four invalid votes. Several clubs, including the ADAC, AAA and KNAF considered withdrawal from the FIA after the decision. Other formerly critical organisations have since said that they <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the vote and now wish to move on. In July 2008, Mosley won a High Court legal case against the News of the World for invasion of privacy. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Eady, said there was: [...] "no evidence that the gathering on March 28, 2008 was intended to be an enactment of Nazi behavior or adoption of any of its attitudes. Nor was it in fact. I see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
500|$|Agni also accepts semen in {{myths of}} the {{conception}} and birth of Karttikeya, a god of male beauty and battle. Numerous versions of Karttikeya's birth story exist, many having a conception from only male input, although heterosexual sex or desire {{also plays a}} part. However, Parvati is credited as Karttikeya's mother due to her having sexual intercourse with Shiva, causing him to ejaculate. Ganga is Karttikeya's mother in other versions, accepting semen from Agni and carrying the unborn child. The male progenitor is sometimes Shiva, Agni, {{or a combination of}} the two. In the Shiva Purana and the Ramayana, the gods fear the outcome of Shiva and Parvati's [...] "unending embrace," [...] and interrupt their coitus. Shiva then appears before the gods and declares [...] "now let him step forward who <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> semen I discharge". At the prompting of the gods, Agni captures Shiva's semen in his hands and swallows it. In these stories, Parvati and Shiva condemn Agni's actions, calling them [...] "wicked" [...] or [...] "improper." [...] In the eleventh century text Kathasaritsagara, however, Shiva forces the reluctant Agni to receive his semen. The semen causes a burning sensation in those that ingest it, prompting Agni to divest it into wives of a group of sages, under Shiva's advice. The sages' wives in turn drop the semen into the Ganges river (the Ganga), where it flows to the shore from which Kārttikeya springs. In the Mahabharata, Kārttikeya is also the son of Agni, who ejaculates into the hands of one of the Krittikas (the Pleiades), who in turn throws the semen into a lake, from whence Kārttikeya is born. In some myths, Agni ejaculates onto a mountain that was itself made from Shiva's divine semen, making Kārttikeya the child of the two gods, according to an interpretation by Markandeya in the Vana Parva.|$|E
500|$|Minerva and Telemaco {{return to}} Ithaca in a chariot. Telemaco is greeted joyfully by Eumete and the {{disguised}} Ulisse in the woodland grove: [...] "O great son of Ulysses, you have indeed returned!" [...] After Eumete goes to inform Penelope of Telemaco's arrival {{a bolt of}} fire descends on Ulisse, removing his disguise and revealing his true identity to his son. The two celebrate their reunion before Ulisse sends Telemaco to the palace, promising to follow shortly. In the palace, Melanto complains to Eurimaco that Penelope still refuses to choose a suitor: [...] "In short, Eurymachus, the lady has a heart of stone." [...] Soon afterwards Penelope receives the three suitors (Antinoo, Pisandro, Anfinomo), and rejects each in turn despite their efforts to enliven the court with singing and dancing: [...] "Now to enjoyment, to dance and song!" [...] After the suitors' departure Eumete tells Penelope that Telemaco has arrived in Ithaca, but she is doubtful: [...] "Such uncertain things redouble my grief." [...] Eumete's message is overheard by the suitors, who plot to kill Telemaco. However, they are unnerved when a symbolic eagle flies overhead, so they abandon their plan and renew their efforts to capture Penelope's heart, this time with gold. Back in the woodland grove, Minerva tells Ulisse that she has organised a means whereby {{he will be able}} to challenge and destroy the suitors. Resuming his beggar's disguise, Ulisse arrives at the palace, where he is challenged to a fight by Iro, ("I will pluck out the hairs of your beard one by one!"), a challenge he accepts and wins. Penelope now states that she <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> suitor who is able to string Ulisse's bow. All three suitors attempt the task unsuccessfully. The disguised Ulisse then asks to try though renouncing the prize of Penelope's hand, and to everyone's amazement he succeeds. He then angrily denounces the suitors and, summoning the names of the gods, kills all three with the bow: [...] "This is how the bow wounds! To death, to havoc, to ruin!" ...|$|E

I hope that so far as possible the people may be given the chance through direct primaries to express who shall be the nominee.

2500|$|... (Note: Starting in {{the late}} 1960s, several {{movements}} in Judaism ceased recognizing Jewish women's offspring as Jews if the women intermarried. The Reconstructionist movement of the United States, followed by the Reform movement of the U.S. in 1983, declared that they would accept the children of either an intermarried Jewish father or an intermarried Jewish mother as Jews only if the children are raised as Jews. If the children are not raised as Jews, and later wish to join the Reform or Reconstructionist movements in the U.S., they must convert. The Society for Humanistic Judaism in the U.S. <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> children {{based on their own}} self-identification.

When a Reverend Mother dies {{in the presence}} of another Reverend Mother, the second <b>will</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> ego/memory of the first to prevent the loss of the dying Reverend Mother's experience and ancestral memories. Especially when the Mother Superior perishes, it is important to take her ego/memory so that her plans and strategies may continue uninterrupted. This is first explored in Dune, when Jessica accepts the life experience of the dying Fremen Reverend Mother Ramallo. In Chapterhouse Dune, Darwi Odrade is Mother Superior, a contentious choice ratified by {{the fact that she was}} present at the previous Mother Superior's death, and has her in Other Memory; she represents the most continuous line of leadership. Under extreme conditions, a large community of Bene Gesserit will practice Extremis Progressiva, a mass sharing of ego/memories with each other to spread all the ego/memories amongst everyone; thus, if one survives, they all survive. [...] In Chapterhouse Dune, the Bene Gesserit school on Lampadas, under attack by the Honoured Matres, undertakes Extremis Progressiva; Lucilla escapes with the [...] "Lampadas Horde", hoping to return to the Bene Gesserit with them.|$|E
