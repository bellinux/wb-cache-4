The action brought {{the total number of}} wards to 58. The measure had support from both parties and passed overwhelmingly. In the general election, two loans questions were on the ballot: $16 million for general municipal improvements, and $10 million for <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> systems. Both measures passed.|$|E

5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E

Intensity VI (Strong) effects were limited to a narrow coastal zone that included Myers Flat in the south and Brookings, Oregon in the north. Damage at this intensity level included broken plate glass windows, cracked walls, foundation and chimney damage, and significant loss of merchandise. In Fields Landing, two homes that came off their foundations, the fallen overpass, and broken gas, <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> lines were associated with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E

Responsibilities included healthcare, the fire brigade, the kindergarten, roads, rubbish disposal, power production, the <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> system, the cinema, cultural actives and the library. Ownership was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993.|$|E

5|$|Due to the city's {{population}} decline, {{beginning in}} the 1920s and accelerating through the 1950s, local government leaders made several attempts to consolidate services. A preGreat Depression annexation attempt by the city failed due to opposition from county voters, and only after World War II would more efforts be made toward consolidation. The first (and one of the few) successful attempts at consolidation resulted {{in the creation of}} the Metropolitan Sewer District, a citycounty <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> company formed in 1954. The next year, however, a citycounty mass transit agency was rejected by voters, followed by a failed charter revision in 1955 that would have unified the city and the county. As the County population grew, local subdivisions began multiplying and incorporating into cities and towns, producing more than 90 separate municipalities by the 1960s. Regional planning advocates succeeded in the 1965 creation of the EastWest Gateway Coordinating Council, a group given the power to approve or deny applications for federal aid from cities.|$|E

25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> tariffs in Jordan are {{differentiated}} by geographic area, {{type of use}} {{and volume}} of use.

Residential <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> tariffs use an increasing-block system, under which users pay a higher tariff per m3 if they consume more water. The first block, corresponding to a consumption of 18m3 per quarter, is a minimum charge independent of the amount of water consumed. <b>Water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> tariffs for non-residential use (commercial and industrial users) are about ten to twenty times higher respectively than residential <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewer</b> tariffs in the lowest consumption block.|$|E
