25|$|Collision {{detection}} typically {{refers to}} the computational problem of detecting the intersection {{of two or more}} objects. While the topic is most often associated with its use in video games and other physical simulations, it also has applications in robotics. In addition to determining whether two objects have collided, collision detection systems may also calculate time of impact (TOI), and report a contact manifold (the set of intersecting points). Collision response deals with simulating <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> collision is detected (see physics engine, ragdoll physics). Solving collision detection problems requires extensive use of concepts from linear algebra and computational geometry.|$|E
25|$|Plastid {{differentiation}} is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible. Chloroplasts may {{be converted}} to chromoplasts, which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit. Starch storing amyloplasts can also {{be converted to}} chromoplasts, {{and it is possible}} for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts. Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> carrot or a potato is illuminated. If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids. Chloroplast, amyloplast, chromoplast, proplast, etc., are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.|$|E

500|$|A key {{passage in}} the novel details <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> vampire enters a room uninvited, an action that {{traditional}} vampire lore usually prohibits. Alfredson originally wanted to omit this from the film, but Ajvide Lindqvist was adamant {{that it had to}} be included. Alfredson was initially nervous about the scene. He realized in post-production that the sound effects and music made it [...] "American, in a bad way", and had to be removed for the scene to work. The end result, which shows Eli slowly beginning to bleed from her eyes, ears, and pores, received positive notices from many critics. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described it as a [...] "haemophilia of rejection".|$|E

500|$|In the Herald Sun, Leigh Paatsch {{gave the}} film one star. He criticised the casting, {{describing}} {{the main characters}} as [...] "supposed to be aged about 20 [...] played by blokes who all look as if they’re 30-plus, and carry on as if they’re not yet 10", and also found the film misogynistic, saying [...] "the derogatory manner in which women are spoken of (and often depicted) is relentlessly, callously crass. Sometimes even hateful". A mixed review from Philippa Hawker of the Sydney Morning Herald concluded [...] "The Australian elements seem hastily inserted and incidental: the movie could have been set in any country that had a water park {{and a place to}} get lost. But as a hymn to male bonding, and an exploration of the comic possibilities of <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> turd hits a water slide, The Inbetweeners 2 is a precisely crafted, assured piece of work".|$|E

[...] William Petry, the vice-president of the local union, asked Chafin to leave, but Chafin responded by brandishing a revolver. [...] Petry then shot Chafin in the chest with a 22-caliber pistol. [...] Petry was later cleared of criminal wrongdoing on the grounds that his action was self-defense, but he expressed no remorse about the shooting and later remarked [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> man carries a toy pistol.

Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls you both, so they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence.

500|$|With {{the rise}} of feminist {{literary}} criticism in the 1970s, Mary Shelley's works, particularly Frankenstein, began to attract much more attention from scholars. Feminist and psychoanalytic critics were {{largely responsible for the}} recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer. Ellen Moers {{was one of the first}} to claim that Shelley's loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein. She argues that the novel is a [...] "birth myth" [...] in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother's death as well as for failing as a parent. Shelley scholar Anne K. Mellor suggests that, from a feminist viewpoint, it is a story [...] "about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> man tries to have a baby without a woman... is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction". Victor Frankenstein's failure as a [...] "parent" [...] in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy, giving birth, and particularly maternity.|$|E

[...] Montagu Curzon of The Spectator wrote that [...] "Guest makes an astonishingly mature debut (he is 27) and has the rare ability to describe childhood as a small child lives it; accepting, helpless, curious." [...] Lois Kendall gave the book a positive review in Cultic Studies Review, and wrote: [...] "The book is deep, yet light and readable, both for those who have had similar life experiences and who, I am sure, will find solace in this book, and for those with no such personal experience, who will find the narrative fascinating." [...] Publishers Weekly characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "Honest and vivid, this is an absorbing book about survival and good intentions gone awry." [...] Gillian Engberg of Booklist called the book a [...] "stirring memoir", and wrote: [...] "Guest writes with a reporter's sense of economy and restraint, letting absurd, even shocking details speak for themselves." [...] Christopher Hart gave the book a positive review in The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Tim Guest’s extraordinary account of his childhood in the communes of Bhagwan, the notorious Indian guru, is a survivor’s tale, poignant, funny and wise." ...|$|E

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide called the episode [...] "A thoroughly enjoyable romp through <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> bunch of lads go for a Sunday out at the ball game."

500|$|Vonnegut was a vocal {{critic of}} the society in which he lived, and this was {{reflected}} in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In The Sirens of Titan, the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of Saturn's moons, Titan, {{as a result of}} his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in Hocus Pocus, the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views. In Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion, Thomas F. Marvin states: [...] "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." [...] Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> [...] "hereditary aristocracy" [...] develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because [...] "they deserve their fate". Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In Slaughterhouse-Five and Timequake the characters have no choice in what they do; in Breakfast of Champions, characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in Cat's Cradle, Bokononism views free will as heretical.|$|E
