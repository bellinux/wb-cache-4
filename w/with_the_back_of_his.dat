500|$|According to Nicholson, [...] "we {{never did}} shoot {{the end of}} the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You'd go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut.

Pitchfork Media reported, [...] "it sure looks official, since Frank seems {{to appear in the}} bloody, somewhat tragic clip (in doctor's garb), and Frank posted it on his Tumblr." [...] It featured Native American cultural imagery and interdimensional elements in its plot. The music video plays out [...] "more like a short film than something you’d see on MTV Jams, this visionary piece sees the OFWGKTA crooner play merely a supporting cast role as a doctor. Ocean makes a cameo as a doctor, though [...] "mostly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head, his footage refreshingly entwined with a girl-saving Native American mystical ritual." [...] The video explores the dreams of a sick girl, a [...] "few primitive zombie-looking people", and some [...] "celestial activity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the matches}} against Carlton, the Waratahs adopted Australian rules, {{and for a}} time, the colonial game {{threatened}} to supersede rugby in Sydney. Coulthard accepted an invitation from Phil Sheridan, a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground, to travel to Sydney {{with the aim of}} fostering Australian rules in the city. On 15 September 1877, soon after his arrival, Coulthard joined several local footballers on a fishing trip in Sydney Harbour. The group was anchored near Shark Island when Coulthard, sitting on the boat's gunwale <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tailcoat hanging over the side, was pulled overboard by [...] "a monster shark, 13 feet long". The shark had seized his coattails trailing on the water and dragged him beneath the surface [...] "some ten or twelve feet" [...] until it tore the coat from his body. After kicking at the shark, Coulthard swam to the surface alongside the boat, [...] "into which he threw, with the aid of his friends, a kind of somersault, just about as quickly as he had been taken overboard." [...] The incident was said to be [...] "one of the most marvellous escapes from a fearful death on record" [...] and [...] "probably without parallel in Australian waters".|$|E
