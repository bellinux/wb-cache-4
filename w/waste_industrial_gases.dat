30|$|Many <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> are emitted discontinuously. The {{purification}} of discontinuously emitted waste gases by biofiltration {{still remains}} challenging. Our {{findings suggest that}} BTF 2 cannot be acclimated and cannot form a robust biofilm successfully under discontinuous operation mode. Biomass accumulation inside BTF 2 was approximately 47 times lower than that observed in the continuously operated BTF 1. EPS, which is the key component of biofilm, was approximately one hundred times higher in BTF 1 than that in BTF 2, indicating that the biofilm formation in BTF 2 was severely affected. Under discontinuous operation mode, microbial cells usually enter a so-called endogenous metabolic state during idle times due to the insufficiency of carbon sources. The growth rates of microorganisms were thus lowered (Gallastegui et al. 2011). Additionally, biofilm formation is a highly complex process involving several steps, such as reversible adhesion to solid surfaces, irreversible attachment and EPS production (Molin and Tolker-Nielsen 2003; Zoubos et al. 2012). Those microbial cells reversibly adhered {{to the surface of}} packing materials can easily detach from the surface when nutrients are limited. In this situation, it is difficult to increase the density of microbial cells to a threshold level at which quorum sensing signal molecules can be produced (Kim et al. 2014).|$|R

Because of its low expansion coefficient and dielectric properties, cordierite is also used in advanced ceramics, catalyst supports automotive, <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> purification and parts subjected to sudden temperature changes. The low intrinsic strength of the cordierite may be compensated {{by the presence of}} mullite, forming a composite material of cordierite-mullite, extending its use to somewhat higher temperatures, at the expense of a slight increase in the thermal expansion coefficient. In this work a cordierite-mullite precursor was prepared from a mixture of magnesium oxide, calcined alumina, silica fume and monoaluminum phosphate solution that produces fast setting at room temperature (∼ 20 minutes) and then, by calcination, cordierite-mullite is generated. The evolution of the mineralogical phases was studied from room temperature to 1350 °C by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry. A possible sequence of chemicals reactions throughout the heat treatment is also proposed. Adding refractory aggregates to this precursor leads to obtaining a fast-setting concrete, suitable for the formation of individual pieces or repair service at moderately high temperatures.

40|$|This work {{focused on}} the {{potential}} of glycerol as a scrubbing solvent for stripping of highly polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> streams. Results for glycerol interactions were compared to those of water. Solubility predictions {{in the form of}} infinite dilution activity coefficients were made using the Modified UNIFAC Dortmund group contribution model, which was set up on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet specifically designed for this purpose. Activity coefficients for VOCs in water and glycerol (highly polar solvents) increased with an increase in the length of the VOC solute nonpolar tail. Furthermore, activity coefficients decreased with an increase in the degree of branching of the VOC solute. The results show that low chain length highly polar alcohol, ketone, organic acid and aldehyde solutes are very soluble in glycerol. Diols, dicarbonyl aldehydes, some ketone derivatives and the ethanolamines also show good solubility. Highly polar diesters and ester derivatives are less soluble in glycerol and water. This study has found glycerol to be a better scrubbing solvent than water in treating highly polar VOCs. However {{it is possible that the}} standard method of building up the glycerol molecule in the UNIFAC may result in under-predictions of activity coefficients and thus special group interaction parameters for glycerol are required...|$|R

Storage options are therefore required and also other possibilities of utilizing this power in a future energy system. Fuel synthesis using CO 2 from <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> and hydrogen from electrolysis is an attractive approach.
