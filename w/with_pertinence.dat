In the stage of primary feature extraction, the feature subset is extracted from the dataset which has the highest proportion of the target category. In the stage of secondary feature extraction, the features that can distinguish the target and interfering categories are added to the feature subset. Our theoretical analysis and experimental observations reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to extract fewer features with greater identification ability of the target category. Moreover, the universality of the proposed algorithm proves to be available with the experiment that every category is set to be the target one...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the perceptual {{organization}} of the visual scene constrains the deployment of attention. Here we investigated how the organization of multiple elements into larger configurations alters their attentional weight, depending on the "pertinence" or behavioral importance of the elements' features. We assessed object-based effects on distinct aspects of the attentional priority map: top-down control, reflecting the tendency to encode targets rather than distracters, and the spatial distribution of attention weights across the visual scene, reflecting the tendency to report elements belonging to the same rather than different objects. In 2 experiments participants had to report the letters in briefly presented displays containing 8 letters and digits, in which pairs of characters could be connected with a line. Quantitative estimates of top-down control were obtained using Bundesen's Theory of Visual Attention (1990). The spatial distribution of attention weights was assessed using the "paired response index" (PRI), indicating responses for within-object pairs of letters. In Experiment 1, grouping along the task-relevant dimension (targets with targets and distracters with distracters) increased top-down control and enhanced the PRI; in contrast, task-irrelevant grouping (targets with distracters) did not affect performance. In Experiment 2, we disentangled the effect of target-target and distracter-distracter grouping: Pairwise grouping of distracters enhanced top-down control whereas pairwise grouping of targets changed the PRI. We conclude that object-based perceptual representations interact <b>with</b> <b>pertinence</b> values (of the elements' features and location) in the computation of attention weights, thereby creating a widespread pattern of attentional facilitation across the visual scene.

40|$|Plant {{primary cell}} walls are {{hydrated}} extracellular complexes composed largely of polysaccharides: cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Cell wall constituents and composition vary in cell-, environment-, and species-dependent manners. For example, within land plant hemicelluloses xyloglucan is ubiquitous while mixedlinkage (1 → 3),(1 → 4) -β-D-glucan (MLG) is {{found only in}} the Poales and Equisetum. Glycosyl hydrolase 16 (GH 16) enzyme family members include numerous enzymes <b>with</b> <b>pertinence</b> {{to the understanding of}} the ‘lives’ of cell wall hemicelluloses. However, despite this, the details of the interactions between GH 16 enzymes and their substrates have often not been elucidated. Likewise, the true preferences of many of these enzymes and the range of substrates which they can utilise remain to be fully explored. By providing a greater wealth of information for the correlation of enzyme structure with reaction catalysed, such an understanding would enable better predictions of the activities of novel enzymes. Crucially, this would also allow better identification of roles performed by these enzymes in planta as well as of the potential applications of these enzymes. This work sought to further our understanding of the interactions between GH 16 enzymes and their substrates by the study of five activities exhibited by GH 16 enzymes – xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET), xyloglucan endoglucanase/hydrolase (XEG/XEH), mixed-linkage glucan : xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (MXE), lichenase and cellulose : xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (CXE). All of the analysed activities act on xyloglucan and/or MLG. Of particular focus is the novel enzyme MXE from the evolutionarily isolated genus Equisetum (horsetail), which acts on both. Notable findings include: identification of MXE/CXE gene; determination of the substrate specificity of MXE; defining of the sites of attack of lichenase, XEG, XET and MXE; discovery of novel xyloglucan structures and discrepancies between the xyloglucan present in different barley organs...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis, On Fate and Fatalism: Photography and Fatal Theories, is a twopart practice-led enquiry {{comprising}} a book {{of photographs}} and an exegesis. This exegesis, entitled Photography and Fatal Theories, is my written interpretation and response to two bodies of artwork presented in my book, On Fate and Fatalism, in which I examine the notion of fate and fatalism through a photographic practice. This project proceeds by posing the question: how can notions of fate and fatalism be explored, articulated and interpreted in a photographic practice? In my series, Femme Fatalist: Woman With Taxidermy, which comprises Part One of my book On Fate and Fatalism, I examine the notion of fate <b>with</b> <b>pertinence</b> to postfeminism and argue that the discourse of postfeminism is enclosed in a discourse of how women relate to popular culture and consumption. My femme fatalist is a parody of the postmodern femme fatale trope, and through conceptualizing popular postfeminism {{as a form of}} fatalism, I present a critique of conspicuous consumption as being an insufficient form of postfeminist empowerment. I suggest that the notion of the abject offers a perspective on the importance of the fatal to subjectivity in postmodernity, and my interest in the fatal follows through to my series, Body Bags: “I am a Trash Bag”, which comprises Part Two of my book of photographs. In this second series, in which I conceptualize the plastic bag as the quintessential icon of postmodern consumption, I move toward a consideration of waste as a means to explore the notions of fate and fatalism. Through this investigation I find that to be a fatalist, and to believe in fate, has lost much of its meaning in postmodernity, and I suggest that practice-led research offers opportunities for a meaningful reconsideration of fate and fatalism’s relevance to discussions of postmodern subjectivity and discourses of consumption...|$|E

The Field Inquiry was designed to capture progress achieved and difficulties encountered by countries in implementing the various commitments and recommendations contained in the ICPD Programme of Action and in the Key Actions for its Further Implementation (ICPD+ 5). The Field Inquiry assessed major sections of the Programme of Action: population and development; gender equality, equity and empowerment of women; reproductive health and rights; behaviour change communication and advocacy; partnerships; resources; data, research and training; and indicators. This information was completed with data provided to a list of socio-economic and demographic indicators, which was administered to all ECLAC/CDCC Member and Associate Member States The report provides an overview of the major economic, social and demographic trends observed in the Caribbean over the past decade, including sector reform and macro-economic adjustment, globalisation and their impact on population issues and concerns. Furthermore, it reflects the assessment of the implementation of the Programme of Action at the sub-regional and national levels conducted by governments and civil society. This includes an analysis of the interrelationships between population, sustained economic growth and sustainable development, issues related to migration patterns, gender equality and the implementation of reproductive health and rights. It also examines the impact of HIV/AIDS and the responses of the Caribbean to the epidemic, as well as the special needs of two age groups, adolescents and older persons.

Having lived through an era of tremendous change over {{the second half of}} the twentieth century and into the twenty-first the author has a great drawing board to contemplate in the context of professional career experience as an engineer. The ability to engage in ‘subject-object’ separation is the means by which Kegan (1994, 2009) explains that transformation takes place and the Essays in this Portfolio aim to support and bring about such change. Exploration of aspects of ‘Kerry’ is the material selected to both challenge support change in the way of knowing from being subject to certain information and knowledge that to being able to consider it more objectively. The task of being able to distance judgement about the economy and economic development of Kerry was facilitated by various readings around of a number of key thinkers including Kegan, Drucker, Porter and Penrose. The central themes of Kerry or the potential for economic development are built into each Essay. Essay One focuses on reflections of Kerry life - on Kerry people within and without Kerry - and events as they affected understandings of how people related to and worked with one another. These reflections formed the basis for transformational goals identified which required a shift from an engineering mindset to encompass an economics-based view. In Essay Two knowledge of economic concepts is developed by exploring the writings of Drucker, Penrose, and Porter <b>with</b> <b>pertinence</b> to considering economic development generally, and for Kerry in particular in the form of an ‘entrepreneurial platform’.
