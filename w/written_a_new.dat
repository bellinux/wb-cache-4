In 1233 he had <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> will, which mentions his brother and a niece named Agatha. He left bequests to his family, his household, Lincoln Cathedral, {{and a number of}} monasteries in his diocese. What was left after the specific legacies was to be divided between poor religious houses, such as the Barrow Gurney Nunnery, students and teachers at Oxford University, Jewish converts and the poor on the episcopal manors.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{this move}} to the Vanilla Studios {{rehearsal}} space, the Clash's songwriters Mick Jones and Joe Strummer had experienced a period of writer's block.

It also stipulates that 'ccusations of apostasy and incitement to violence are prohibited'.

Critics have pointed out alleged flaws of this formulation, namely that it violates the freedom of expression.|$|E
25|$|In New York City, Laurents went to {{the opening}} night party for a new play by Ugo Betti, and there he met Sondheim, who had heard that East Side Story, now retitled West Side Story, was back on track. Bernstein had decided he needed to {{concentrate}} solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on Peter Pan instead. Laurents asked Sondheim {{if he would be}} interested in tackling the task. Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (Saturday Night had been aborted), but Oscar Hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted. Meanwhile, Laurents had <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> draft of the book changing the characters' backgrounds: Anton, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish Maria had become a Puerto Rican.|$|E
500|$|Although commercially successful, Quatermass 2’s {{release was}} largely {{overshadowed by the}} box-office record-breaking {{performance}} of Hammer's The Curse of Frankenstein, which was also released in May 1957. Upon this success, Hammer made its priority the production of Gothic horror films. For this reason, although Nigel Kneale had <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Quatermass serial for the BBC, Quatermass and the Pit (broadcast December 1958 to January 1959), Hammer did not acquire the rights until 1961 and the film version did not appear until 1967. [...] Quatermass 2 is notable, however, for being the first film Hammer pre-sold to a major US distributor, in this case United Artists. This new finance and distribution deal would become the norm for subsequent Hammer films and led to them eventually winding down their own distribution arm, Exclusive Films, in the mid-1960s.|$|E

2500|$|When Bernhardt {{returned}} from her 1886–1887 tour, {{she received a}} new invitation {{to return to the}} Comédie Française. The theater management was willing to forget the conflict of her two previous periods there, and offered a payment of 150,000 francs a year. The money appealed to her, and she began negotiations. However, the senior members of the company protested the high salary offered, and conservative defenders of the more traditional theater also complained; one anti-Bernhardt critic, Albert Delpit of Le Gaulois, wrote, [...] "Madame Sarah Bernhardt is forty-three; she can no longer be useful to the Comédie. Moreover, what roles could she have? I can only imagine that she could play mothers..." [...] Bernhardt was deeply offended and immediately broke off negotiations. She turned once again to Sardou, who had <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> play for her, La Tosca, which featured a prolonged and extremely dramatic death scene at the end. The play was staged at the Porte Saint-Martin Theater, opening on 24 November 1887. It was extremely popular, and critically acclaimed. Bernhardt played the role for 29 consecutive sold-out performances. The success of the play allowed Bernhardt to buy a new pet lion for her household menagerie. She named him Scarpia, after the villain of La Tosca. The play inspired Giacomo Puccini to write one of his most famous operas, Tosca (1900).|$|E
2500|$|After a {{break of}} more than three centuries, writing of vachana poems was revived. Though some poets such as Tontada Siddhalingayati (1540), Swatantra Siddhalingeswara (1565), Ganalingideva (1560), Shanmukha Swamy (1700), Kadasiddheswara (1725) and Kadakolu Madivallappa (1780) {{attempted}} to re-popularise the tradition with noteworthy pieces, they lacked the mastery of the 12th century social reformers. The most notable of the later day vachanakaras (lit. [...] "Vachana poets") were undoubtedly Sarvajna and Sisunala Sherif (late 18th century). Sarvajna {{is known to have}} lived sometime between the mid-16th century and the late 17th century. Though the vachana poetic tradition had come to a temporary halt, the creation of anthologies and commentaries based on the earlier vachana canon, depicting the 12th century Veerashaiva saints as its protagonists, became popular from around c.1400. Among well-known 16th century anthologists were Channaveeracharya (16th century) and Singalada Siddhabasava (c.1600) who interpreted the vachanas from a purely philosophical and meta-physical context. In the Keladi court, notable works on doctrine, such as Virasaivadharma siromani ("Crest jewel of the moral order of the Veerashaivas") and Virasaivananda chandrike ("Moonlight to delight the Veerashaivas") were <b>written.</b> <b>A</b> <b>new</b> genre of mystic Kaivalya literature, a synthesis of the Veerashaiva and the Advaitha (monistic) philosophy, consolidated from the 16th century onwards. While the most famous writings are ascribed to Nijaguna Shivayogi (c.1500), later day writers such as Mahalingaranga (Anubhavamrita in shatpadi metre, c.1675) and Chidanandavadhuta (Jnana Sindhu) are also notable.|$|E
2500|$|On August 30, 1928, the Marion Palace Theatre {{opened to}} a packed house for two performances. At the first performance, Colonel George B. Christian gave a brief opening address. The father of President Warren G. Harding's secretary, George B. Christian Jr., the elder Christian was {{actively}} involved in Marion's civic life. His remarks included a short history of theatres in Marion, and he praised {{the beauty of the}} building. John Eberson then made a few remarks and introduced Young. He presented Young with a bag of birdseed, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the stuffed pigeons that Eberson had installed to create the feeling of being outdoors at the Palace. The entertainment began with organ music by Banks Kennedy, a well-known Chicago organist. He had <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> composition, which he titled [...] "Everybody's Welcome to the Palace." [...] Next was a theatre overture, [...] "A Night in the Clock Store," [...] by the Palace Orchestra under the direction of Elmer Newstrom. Four vaudeville acts followed: Harry Kahne, a nationally known mental wizard; Tilyou and Rogers, a comedy team; Johnny Mack and Company (including Ethel Dunton, Dolly Moran and Shirley Manion); and the Castlemans, a trio of entertainers. Following the live acts, a Metro-Goldwin-Mayer silent picture, Excess Baggage (1928 film), starring William Haines, Josephine Dunn and Ricardo Cortez, was shown. The film is now lost. The owner had hoped to open the theatre with the new [...] "talkie" [...] equipment. While the theatre was pre-wired for sound motion pictures, the equipment did not arrive until the following year.|$|E

60|$|P.S.--Since I {{wrote the}} foregoing, Mr. McCrackan's article {{appeared}} (in the March {{number of the}} North American Review). Before his article appeared--that is to say, during December, January, and February--I had <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> book, a character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from her own acts and words, and it was then--together with the three brief articles previously published in the North American Review--ready to be delivered to the printer for issue in book form. In that book, by accident and good luck, I have answered the objections made by Mr. McCrackan to my views, and therefore {{do not need to}} add an answer here. Also, in it I have corrected certain misstatements of mine which he has noticed, and several others which he has not referred to. There are one or two important matters of opinion upon which he and I are not in disagreement; but there are others upon which we must continue to disagree, I suppose; indeed, I know we must; for instance, he believes Mrs. Eddy wrote Science and Health, whereas I am quite sure I can convince a person unhampered by predilections that she did not.|$|E

I've got a capital chorus of mermaids to balance the other chorus of Biological Professors on the Challenger Expedition. I consider it's a happy cross between Ariosto and Aristophanes. If you like, I'll give you the score, and read over the words to you.' 'Do,' said the old man, settling himself down in comfort in his son's easy-chair, and assuming the sternest air of an impartial critic. Arthur Berkeley read on dramatically, in his own clever airy fashion, suiting accent and gesture to the subject matter through the whole first three acts of that exquisitely humorous opera, the Primate of Fiji. Sometimes he hummed the tune over to himself as he went; sometimes he played a few notes upon his flute by way of striking the key-note; sometimes he rose from his seat in his animation, and half acted the part he was reading with almost unconscious and spontaneous mimicry. He read through the famous song of the President of the Local Government Board, that everybody has since heard played by every German band at the street corners; through the marvellously catching chorus of the superannuated tide-waiters; through the culminating dialogue between the London Missionary Society's Agent and the Hereditary Grand Sacrificer to the King of Fiji. Of course the recital lacked everything of the scenery and dresses that give it so much vogue upon the stage; but it had at least the charmingly suggestive music, the wonderful linking of sound to sense, the droll and inimitable intermixture of the plausible and the impossible which everybody has admired and laughed at in the acted piece.|$|E
