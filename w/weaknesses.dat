5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. <b>Weaknesses</b> in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these <b>weaknesses</b> unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E

For some of his early appearances he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human <b>weaknesses,</b> while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. Although his anger over his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{may have}} a similar distribution of muscle <b>weakness.</b> Deciding on a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis or LEMS on clinical grounds may therefore be difficult. OBJECTIVE: To compare the localisation of initial muscle <b>weakness</b> {{and the distribution of}} <b>weakness</b> at the time of maximum severity in patients with myasthenia gravis and LEMS. SUBJECTS: 101 patients with myasthenia gravis and 38 patients with LEMS. RESULTS: In myasthenia gravis, initial <b>weakness</b> involved extraocular muscles in 59 %, bulbar muscles in 29 %, and limb muscles in 12 % of the patients. In LEMS no patient had ocular <b>weakness,</b> 5 % had bulbar <b>weakness,</b> and 95 % had <b>weakness</b> of the limbs as the first symptom (p < 0. 001). At the point of maximum severity, <b>weakness</b> in myasthenia gravis was purely ocular in 25 %, oculobulbar in 5 %, restricted to the limbs in 2 %, and present in both oculobulbar muscles and limbs in 68 %. At this point, none of the LEMS patients had <b>weakness</b> restricted to extraocular or bulbar muscles (p = 0. 002). The legs were affected in all LEMS patients, whereas in 12 patients with generalised myasthenia gravis limb <b>weakness</b> was restricted to the arms (p = 0. 024). CONCLUSIONS: In a patient suspected to have a myasthenic syndrome whose first symptom is ocular <b>weakness,</b> LEMS is virtually excluded. Limb <b>weakness</b> confined to the arms is only found in generalised myasthenia gravis and not in LEMS. Muscle <b>weakness</b> in myasthenia gravis tends to develop in a craniocaudal direction, and in the opposite direction in LEMS...|$|R

5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act.

A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{protection}} scheme of the Yamato class still suffered from several major design flaws and shortcomings. The torpedo defense system performed substantially worse than designed; in particular, very poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armour created a rupture-prone seam {{just below the}} waterline, causing the class to be susceptible to torpedoes. Other structural <b>weaknesses</b> existed near {{the bow of the}} vessels, where the armour plating was generally thinner. These deficiencies proved crucial, particularly for the first two members of the class when they were each seriously damaged by submarine torpedoes in 1943 and then sunk by torpedo bombers in 1944–45.

40|$|Conflict {{scholars}} have devoted considerable {{attention to the}} natural resource curse, and specifically to connections between natural resources, state <b>weakness,</b> and civil war. Many have posited a state <b>weakness</b> mechanism – that significant oil production causes state <b>weakness,</b> and state <b>weakness</b> consequently {{increases the likelihood of}} civil war onset. Using standard measures, this paper demonstrates that the state <b>weakness</b> mechanism does not exist in the short or medium term. The methods developed in this paper show that in only two cases is there the possibility of a medium term effect, and the state <b>weakness</b> mechanism is unlikely to be operative even in these two cases. Furthermore, these methods do not rely on assumptions about unmeasured confounders, so this result is robust to the consideration of other risk factors for civil war onset. The state <b>weakness</b> mechanism may still exist in the form of long term effects or an effect that reinforces pre-existing war and/or state <b>weakness.</b> However, the null hypothesis of no long-term and/or reinforcing effect cannot be rejected without the use of additional assumptions...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{complications}} {{are common}} in the terminal stages of multiple sclerosis and contribute to mortality in these patients. When respiratory motor pathways are involved, respiratory muscle <b>weakness</b> frequently occurs. Although it is well established that <b>weakness</b> of the respiratory muscles produces a restrictive ventilatory defect, the degree of muscle <b>weakness</b> and pulmonary function are poorly related. Respiratory muscle <b>weakness</b> was observed in patients with normal or near normal pulmonary function. Expiratory muscle <b>weakness</b> is more prominent than inspiratory muscle <b>weakness</b> and may impair performance of coughing. Subsequently, in addition to bulbar dysfunction, respiratory muscle <b>weakness</b> may contribute to ineffective coughing, pneumonia, and sometimes even acute ventilatory failure may ensue. Respiratory muscle <b>weakness</b> may also occur early {{in the course of}} the disease. Recent studies suggest that the respiratory muscles can be trained for both strength and endurance in multiple sclerosis patients. Whether respiratory muscle training delays the development of respiratory dysfunction and subsequently improves exercise capacity and cough efficacy, prevents pulmonary complications or prolongs survival in the long-term remains to be determined. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz {{beginning}} in 1873 described {{how to avoid}} <b>weaknesses</b> in one's own position and how to create and exploit such <b>weaknesses</b> in the opponent's position. The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz {{was the first to}} break a position down into its components. Before Steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely develop their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.|$|E

5|$|Several major <b>weaknesses</b> in Akagis design {{were not}} rectified. Akagis {{aviation}} fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These <b>weaknesses</b> would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E
