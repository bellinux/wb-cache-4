I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now.

25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} the Gacaca activities and the gradual support for Gacaca by the authorities was clearly motivated {{by the fact that}} the ordinary justice system was virtually non-existent after the genocide. The Gacaca had to do <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> before—relieve the pressure on the ordinary courts. These were now not working slowly, as they did before, but not working at all. Once they started to work, they were quickly overloaded with the cases of genocide suspects who were filling the prisons. This new form of justice was bold, but not unprecedented: This becomes evident when one considers the emerging numbers of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRC) as, for example, that in South Africa. The slogan of the South African TRC “Revealing is Healing” and its argument that truth-telling serves as a “therapeutic function” underline this assumption. The TRC format was suggested to the Rwandan government, but ultimately they chose to pursue mass justice through Gacaca; a system where their country had roots and familiarity.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{reaction}} of some fans was dismay, {{as there were}} concerns that The Next Generation would continue to lift stories from The Original Series.

500|$|The {{second factor}} that brought about change was {{the early modern}} {{ascendancy}} of the individual, and focus on privacy. Already in the later Middle Ages castles had begun to incorporate {{an increasing number of}} private chambers, for the use both of the lord and of his servants. Once the castle was discarded to the benefit of palaces or stately homes, this tendency was reinforced. This did not mean an end to the employment of domestic servants, or even in all cases a reduction in household staff. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> mean, however, was a realignment whereby the family [...] in a genealogical sense [...] became the cornerstone of the household.|$|E

500|$|Supporters of Truman's {{decision}} argue that, {{given the}} tenacious Japanese {{defense of the}} outlying islands, the bombings saved {{hundreds of thousands of}} lives that would have been lost invading mainland Japan. Critics have argued that the use of nuclear weapons was unnecessary, given that conventional tactics such as firebombing and a naval blockade might have induced Japan's surrender without the need for such weapons. Truman strongly defended himself in his memoirs in 1955–56, stating that many lives could have been lost had the U.S. invaded mainland Japan without the atomic bombs. In 1963, he stood by his decision, telling a journalist that [...] "it was done to save 125,000 youngsters on the American side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life." ...|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{took up the}} {{practice}} of law in 1865 as a means to improve his personal finances. His efforts took him to Wall Street where, the day after Lincoln's assassination, a riotous crowd led him into an impromptu speech to calm it: [...] "Fellow citizens! Clouds and darkness are round about Him! His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies! Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne! Mercy and truth shall go before His face! Fellow citizens! God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives!" [...] The speech, with no mention or praise of Lincoln, was according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell [...] "...quite as significant for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not contain as for what it did." [...] In the following years, Garfield had more praise for Lincoln; a year after the Illinoisan's death Garfield stated that, [...] "Greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln," [...] and in 1878 called Lincoln [...] "...one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power." ...|$|E
500|$|Another failure, {{identified}} by Bracha, is {{not found in}} what the Statute covered, but in <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not.

Moreover, the right provided was merely that of [...] "making and selling... exact reprints. To a large extent, the new regime was the old stationer's privilege, except it was universalised, capped in time, and formally conferred upon authors rather than publishers". The effect of the Statute on authors was also minimal. Previously, publishers would have bought the original manuscript from writers for a lump sum; {{with the passage of}} the Statute, they simply did the same thing, but with the manuscript's copyright as well. The remaining economic power of the Company also allowed them to pressure booksellers and distributors into continuing their past arrangements, meaning that even theoretically [...] "public domain" [...] works were, in practise, still treated as copyrighted.|$|E

[...] Though the Liberals' fortunes had been sagging in the post-war years, there remained no doubt that they could again defeat the Conservatives; their real challenge was evidently from the newly politicized UFA.

500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E
500|$|The {{repercussions of}} the {{euthanasia}} for Dot's character {{have been described}} as [...] "extremely serious" [...] as she suffered from [...] "untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action."

Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person she could talk to [...] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [...] to Graham Greene.

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Anasazi" [...] was rated an A, being described as [...] "mind-blowing if frustrating", with it being noted that the episode [...] "made fans want to fast-forward through summer." [...] Writing The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A-, noting that the episode [...] "has {{a lot of really}} strong moments" [...] and praising Duchovny's acting. However, he felt that the episode marked {{the point at which the}} series' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus, explaining that [...] "it's troubling that instead of answering any big issues here ... the show only gives us new directions". Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I'm proud of the way it came together, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten. I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered."

The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E
500|$|However, the {{estimated}} average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be in excess of twenty years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially. In 2004, wind energy cost a fifth of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> in the 1980s, and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt turbines were mass-produced. In 2012 capital costs for wind turbines were substantially lower than 2008–2010 but still above 2002 levels. A 2011 report from the American Wind Energy Association stated, [...] "Wind's costs have dropped {{over the past two}} years, in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour recently.... about 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electric power, and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year.... winning more mainstream acceptance from Wall Street's banks.... Equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years {{as was the case in}} previous cycles.... 5,600 MW of new installed capacity is under construction in the United States, more than double the number at this point in 2010. Thirty-five percent of all new power generation built in the United States since 2005 has come from wind, more than new gas and coal plants combined, as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E
