40|$|Local governments {{across the}} United States spent {{approximately}} $ 5 billion, {{an average of}} $ 100 million per state, on energy for their public schools in 1992. This represents a tremendous drain on education dollars of which part (captured through building system and operational efficiency improvements) could be directed toward more important educational needs. States and local governments know there are sizeable opportunities, but are challenged by how and where to start. IdentifLing the worst energy performers, with the most potential, easily and at low cost is a key in motivating local governments into action. Energy benchmarking is an excellent tool for this purpose. The 1992 US Energy Information Administration’s Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) database is investigated {{as a source for}} energy benchmarks for local-government-owned schools. Average energy use values derived from CBECS are shown to be poor energy benchmarks. Simple distributions of building energy use values derived from CBECS, however, are shown to be reliable energy benchmarks for local schools. These can be used to gauge the energy performance of your local public school. Using a stepwise, linear-regression analysis, the primary determinants of electric use in local schools were found to be gross floor area, year of construction, use of <b>walk-in</b> coolers, electric <b>cooling,</b> non-electric energy use, roof construction, and HVAC operational responsibility. The determinants vary depending on the school’s location. While benchmarking based on simple distributions is a good method, an improved benchmarking method which can account for these additional drivers of energy use is detailed...|$|R
40|$|Fucus vesiculosus L. (Phaeophyceae) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} and hence ecologically most important primary producer, carbon sink and habitat provider in the western Baltic Sea. All F. vesiculosus L. specimens were collected on 23 April 2014 from a depth of 0. 2 - 1 m in the non-tidal Kiel Fjord, western Baltic Sea (54 ° 27 'N; 10 ° 12 'E), where this species forms dense and almost monospecific stands on stones. After sampling the algal thalli were stored in a refrigerator box with water from the sampling site, transported to Bremerhaven and stored at 10 °C for one day in filtered seawater. Experiments were conducted with vegetative apical tips (6. 7 ± 0. 5 cm length), the actively growing region of F. vesiculosus, which were randomly selected and cut from 144 different individuals prior to the experiments. These tips were acclimated to laboratory conditions for three days in filtered seawater at 10 °C {{before the start of}} the experiment. Furthermore, 30 additional vegetative apices were freeze-dried to document the initial biochemical status of F. vesiculosus in its native habitat. A temperature gradient was installed in a <b>walk-in</b> constant <b>cooling</b> chamber (15 °C) in nine water baths (5, 10, 15, 20, 24, 26, 27, 28 and 29 °C ± 0. 1 °C) which were tempered by thermostats (5, 10 and 15 °C: Huber Variostat CC + Pilot ONE, Peter Huber Kältemaschinen GmbH, Offenburg, Germany; 20 and 28 °C: Haake DC 3, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA; 24, 26, 27 and 29 °C: Haake DC 10). Every temperature treatment consisted of four 2 L glass beakers (n = 4). In each beaker four F. vesiculosus apices were grown in 2 µm-filtered North Sea water diluted with demineralized water in a ratio of 1 : 1 and enriched with nutrients after Provasoli (1968; 1 / 10 enrichment), leading to a salinity of about 15. 6 which equaled habitat conditions. The algae were exposed to an irradiance of 130 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1 ± 10 % (Powerstar HGI-TS 150 W, OSRAM GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) measured at the top of the beaker under a 16 : 8 h L:D cycle. The media in the beakers was changed every third or fourth day and aerated with artificial air containing 380 ppm CO 2 (gas mixing device; HTK Hamburg GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Before the experiment, the algae were acclimated to the final temperatures in steps of 5 °C for 2 days each, beginning at 10 °C. After 21 days exposure time, three out of four samples per replicate were freeze-dried for further biochemical analyses, and afterwards the thermostats were turned off to reduce the temperature to 16 ± 0. 4 °C for another 10 days permitting growth under post-culture conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Initially the Warm Creek Ranch {{headquarters}} was {{slated to}} be used as the [...] "base of operations" [...] for the eco-sanctuary. However, on September 11, 2012, a month after the BLM published the Federal Register Notice with no provision for paying Pickens to maintain the horses on the allotment, she made reference to plans for a luxury resort called the Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco-Resort. Pickens began converting the headquarters for the resort, and began renovating the old ranchhouse there to become a dining hall and kitchen. [...] On April 3, 2013, the Elko County Commission approved a liquor license for venture, and Pickens spent a million dollars on [...] "Safari Tents" [...] or Tee Pees for the guests. The eco-resort was open for business in the summer of 2014 and, among other things, offered horseback rides on BLM-administered public lands and using the fore-mentioned road to the private property in Goshute Valley to take guests to see the horses kept there. Pickens states she was informed by the BLM in December of that year that she would need a permit to use the road and public lands for her commercial ventures and that she filed the application for the permit. Pickens claims that in October 2015 the BLM told her the paperwork had been misplaced, and her representative claims that the BLM requested trivial information to process the application. Also, Elko County officials determined that the food preparation facilities she planned did not meet the County health and safety codes, and required her to install a commercial kitchen. [...] By February, 2016 the BLM had not finished processing the permit application and the County's safety codes had not yet been met. The County required Pickens to, in case of fire, to put sprinkler systems in the lavishly furnished teepees, and because the town of Wells had, in 2008, suffered a major earthquake, she was required to modify the <b>walk-in</b> <b>cooler</b> in the kitchen to be earthquake proof. [...] Pickens issued a press release on February 10, 2016, stating the resort would not open for 2016, but although the Mustang Monument website stated she hoped to open in 2017 and having spent $25 million on the venture, she stated on September 1, 2016, she was [...] "out of it" [...] and would sell the Tee Pees. George Knapp, an investigative reporter for a Las Vegas television station, states she said that she had made a bad decision and she would not spend more money on the venture.

40|$|Evaporators {{found in}} most HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R {{applications}} use multiple circuits to address the multidimensional optimization problem of cost, capacity, and air-/refrigerant side pressure drop. However, an inherent problem of having multiple refrigerant circuits in evaporators is that maldistribution can occur. This maldistribution can be caused on the refrigerant side by quality and/or mass flow maldistribution at the refrigerant distributor. On the air-side, maldistribution {{can be caused by}} uneven airflow and/or air inlet temperature; on both sides the possibility of uneven fouling exists. To reduce the performance penalties caused by air-side maldistribution, the hybrid control method was used to optimize the refrigerant distribution to individual circuits. The hybrid control uses a primary expansion valve, which provides for most of the pressure drop, and smaller secondary balancing valves, which adjust the individual circuit mass flowrates. This approach was chosen since it is expected that the balancing valves can be manufactured at much lower cost than individual expansion valves for each circuit. In order to assess how severe the influence on maldistribution is, four applications with high potential for air-side maldistribution were selected and investigated experimentally, as well as in simulation studies. ^ Application 1 was a 3 -ton R 404 A <b>walk-in</b> <b>cooler</b> refrigeration system for a storage room with a target temperature of 2 °C (35. 6 °F). It was found that the increasing air-side maldistribution, caused by uneven frost built up over time can lead to severe hunting with liquid overfeed from the evaporator, when using the factory installed thermostatic expansion valve (TXV). An electronic expansion valve (EXV) was used as baseline for the performance evaluations. It was found, that in both the TXV and EXV case, significant refrigerant maldistribution occurred even if the system was tested with no enforced air-side maldistribution. After including the balancing valves, the system coefficient of performance (COP) increased by approximately 4...|$|E
40|$|Woody {{perennial}} plants including blackberries (Rubus subgenus Rubus Watson) require certain amounts of chilling or rest hours below 7 T during the dormant season for successful bud break the following year. Blackberry cultivars developed in Arkansas are being grown in various climates worldwide, and all cultivars need chilling requirement estimates for accurate recommendations of adaptation. Determining chilling requirements using stem cuttings collected from field-grown plants rather than whole plants is a desirable system. We {{conducted a study}} to evaluate both artificial- and field-chilling of six cultivars. For the artificial-chilling study, 12 -node stem cuttings were collected 2 days after the first killing frost. These were then placed in a moist medium in a <b>walk-in</b> <b>cooler</b> at 30 C.

40|$|Agriculture is an ever-changing industry. Improved {{technologies}} and farming practices {{have helped to}} increase the amount of food that production agriculture has been able to produce to feed the growing world population. However, there are still issues that cause concern within the agriculture industry. One of these issues is seed carry-over from year to year. If soybean seed is not used, it must be incinerated (burned), buried, or planted at high volumes. Recent studies have indicated that there may be a potential to carry excess soybean seed over to the next cropping season if the soybean seed is treated with a fungicide or fungicide-insecticide mixture before being put into storage. The objective of this study was to determine whether treating soybeans with a fungicide before putting them into storage could preserve the viability and vigor of the seed and slow seed deterioration. There were five treatment groups for the three different varieties of soybeans. The active ingredients in the treatments used were 1) fluxapyroxad, 2) mefenoxam/fludioxonil, 3) thiabendazole, 4) pyroclostrobin, and 5) control. After treatment, the seeds were packaged and stored in three different storage environments: cold storage, laboratory storage, and warehouse storage, where temperature and relative humidity were monitored. The seeds were stored for periods of two months, four months, and six months. Upon removal of the seed from storage, the seeds were tested for seed viability (using the “ragdoll” germination method) and for seed vigor (using the accelerated aging method). Data was analyzed to determine whether there were any significant interactions between seed variety, storage environment, and fungicide treatment for both seed viability and seed vigor. For seed viability, variety was the only significant factor for several time periods. For seed vigor, there was a significant interaction between environment and variety. In particular, one variety had very low seed viability and vigor throughout the study. The two other varieties had similar germination percentages for all storage periods. Unlike previous studies, this study was not able to find a significant treatment effect between the active ingredients in the fungicides used. However, if seed deterioration rate can be slowed, it may be possible for soybean seed to be carried over to the next cropping season if it is a variety with a high germination rate that is stored in a cold storage environment like a <b>walk-in</b> <b>cooler.</b> Many farmers and individuals within the agriculture industry stand to benefit from having a technique or method that could allow some soybean seed to be carried over until the next cropping season...|$|E
