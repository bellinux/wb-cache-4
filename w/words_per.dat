5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication is typically much slower than speech, with users generally producing 8–10 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute. Rate enhancement strategies {{can increase the}} user's rate of output to around 12–15 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute, {{and as a result}} enhance the efficiency of communication.|$|E
5|$|The Amateur Station Operator's Licence, General Grade, {{requires}} {{a minimum of}} 50% in each section of the written examination, and 60% overall, and a demonstration of proficiency in sending and receiving Morse code at 8 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute (without errors for each). The minimum age is 14 years. The licence allows a user to make radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony transmission in 13 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 400W. In addition, satellite communication, facsimile, and television modes are permitted.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
50|$|A {{difference}} between amateur radio licenses and commercial radiotelegraph licenses is that commercial operators {{must be able}} to receive code groups of random characters along with plain language text. For each class of license, the code group speed requirement is slower than the plain language text requirement. For example, for the Radiotelegraph Operator License, the examinee must pass a 20 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> minute plain text test and a 16 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> minute code group test.|$|R

50|$|As {{an example}} {{illustrating}} switching speeds or timing requirements consider that when sending Morse code at a 20 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> minute rate the typical dot signal duration {{is a mere}} 50 milliseconds. To enable good quality QSK operation the switching hardware must switch the radio antenna from receiver to transmitter in much less than one tenth of the dot duration. At 20 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> minute code speed this means that QSK T/R switching times {{must be in the}} range of 1 to 1/2 millisecond or below. Even smaller sub-millisecond times are required with higher speed Morse code transmissions.|$|R
5|$|Emily Herbert is the pen name of British {{journalist}} Virginia Blackburn. Blackburn wrote {{articles about}} Lady Gaga in publications including The Express, and the Herald Sun. Her biography of Katie Price, Katie and Peter: Too Much in Love, became a number one bestseller {{in the category}} of paperback non-fiction. She also wrote Michael Jackson: King of Pop, Kerry: Story of a Survivor (about Kerry Katona), Robbie: A Life Less Ordinary (Robbie Williams), and Gok Wan: The Biography (Gok Wan). Blackburn specializes in celebrity biographies; she motivates herself to write 5,000 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> day. Overlook Press stated it was the first published biography about Lady Gaga.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the other end of the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> day of messages.|$|E
5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three <b>words</b> <b>per</b> month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

25|$|On January 7, 1972, the FCC amended Part 97 {{to allow}} faster RTTY speeds. Four {{standard}} RTTY speeds were authorized, namely, 60 (45 baud), 67 (50 baud), 75 (56.25 baud) and 100 (75 baud) <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute. Many Amateur Radio operators had equipment that {{was capable of}} being upgraded to 75 and 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute by changing teleprinter gears. While there was an initial interest in 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute operation, many Amateur Radio operators moved back to 60 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute. Some {{of the reasons for}} the failure of 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute HF RTTY included poor operation of improperly maintained mechanical teleprinters, narrow bandwidth terminal units, continued use of 170Hz shift at 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute and excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the {{increasing}} pace of business communication {{had created a}} need for mechanization of the writing process. Stenographers and telegraphers could take down information at rates up to 130 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute, whereas a writer with a pen was limited {{to a maximum of}} 30 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute (the 1853 speed record).|$|E

25|$|For Grade II, {{the test}} piece {{consists}} of 125 letters, with five letters forming one word. Candidates {{are required to}} transmit by using a Morse key for five consecutive minutes at the minimum speed of five <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute.

25|$|Some {{shorthand}} systems {{attempted to}} ease {{learning by using}} characters from the Latin alphabet. Such non-stenographic systems have often been described as alphabetic, and purists might claim that such systems are not 'true' shorthand. However, these alphabetic systems do have value for students who cannot dedicate the years necessary to master a stenographic shorthand. Alphabetic shorthands cannot be written at the speeds theoretically possible with symbol systems—200 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute or more—but require {{only a fraction of}} the time to acquire a useful speed of between 60 and 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> minute.|$|E
