"Cop Killer" [...] was {{replaced}} by a new version of [...] "Freedom of Speech," [...] a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just <b>Watch</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Say. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Foxy Lady." [...] Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of [...] "Cop Killer" [...] has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song [...] "still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it, too, and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on Law & Order SVU." ...|$|E

[...] Shortly after, he released his debut album Rhyme Pays in 1987 supported by DJ Evil E, DJ Aladdin and producer Afrika Islam, who helped create the mainly party-oriented sound. The record wound up being certified gold by the RIAA. That same year, he recorded the title theme song for Dennis Hopper's Colors, a film about inner-city gang life in Los Angeles. His next album Power was released in 1988, under his own label Rhyme Syndicate, {{and it was a}} more assured and impressive record, earning him strong reviews and his second gold record. Released in 1989, The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just <b>Watch</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Say established his popularity by matching excellent abrasive music with narrative and commentative lyrics.

Elliott Gould was not exactly my idea of Philip Marlowe, but anyway there we were. Also, as far as the story was concerned, time had gone by—it was twenty-odd years since the novel was written, and the private eye had become a cliché. It had become funny. You had to <b>watch</b> out <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were doing. If you had Humphrey Bogart at the same age that he was when he did The Big Sleep, he wouldn't do it the same way. Also, we were faced with a technical problem of this enormous book, which was the longest one Chandler ever wrote. It's tremendously involuted and convoluted. If you did it the way he wrote it, you would have a five-hour film.Brackett says that Brian G. Hutton was originally attached as director and wanted the script structured so that [...] "the heavy had planned the whole thing from the start" [...] but when writing it she found the idea contrived.|$|R

40|$|Urban space reading {{can be done}} in {{different}} ways, but its understanding and its full meaning can only takes place through the drawing. Using different means of representation, at our disposal today, we can grasp different aspects of the investigated area. Both pencil and creation of a virtual model represent the place in an objective or subjective way, but the results obtained in the second case gives the possibility of interactive interpretation and reuse. The substantial difference between the two methods is therefore that the first is static and the second is dynamic: one does not replace the other, rather they complement each other. Working with some students in the Faculty of Architecture of Cagliari, in a drawing workshop, we tried to compare the two methods, integrating them, and obtaining as a result the final virtual model of a portion of the city of Cagliari, rich in cultural, historical, and social meanings. The realization of the virtual model has uncovered problems and peculiarities of the place that otherwise would not have emerged. As you draw you are forced to investigate the place you want to represent, in all the details that make it up, and then you can take and play them in the model. In conclusion, the creation of the virtual model has enabled us to deep the knowledge of the place having a more complete picture, which should lead to a more conscious design. “Drawing is an element of self-knowledge, pursuit of our awareness of things, reflection on our ability to understand <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think. Only when you start drawing you realize that there are things you thought clear and instead are much more complicated than expected and others, that seemed dark and become clear only when you draw them. ” (Ferreira Nunes 2008) ...|$|R
