50|$|Both the Nautilus and Colossus have a sonar {{system that}} {{indicates}} the direction {{to the other}} ship. When the two are aligned vertically the display turns red and a <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounds.|$|R
2500|$|The Ministry song [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (from {{the album}} The Mind Is a Terrible Thing To Taste) {{features}} an audio {{sample of the}} military station's <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> and a few notes of composer John Harrison's synthesized score.|$|R
50|$|On 9 March 1986, a Vickers Viscount (registration: G-BLNB) made a wheels up landing, {{the landing}} gear <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> not having functioned correctly. There were no {{injuries}} to the 3 occupants; after repair the aircraft was returned to service.|$|R
50|$|All {{aircraft}} with retractable {{landing gear}} are required to {{have a way to}} indicate the status of the landing gear, which is normally a set of lights that change colors from red to amber to green depending on whether the gear are up, in transit, or down. However, a distracted pilot may forget to look at these lights. This has led to aircraft designers building extra safety systems in the aircraft to reduce the possibility of human error. In small aircraft this most commonly {{takes the form of a}} <b>warning</b> light and <b>horn</b> which operate when any of the landing gear is not locked down and any of the engine throttles are retarded below a cruise power setting. However, the horn has been useless in situations when the pilot was unfamiliar with the aircraft and did not know what the horn sounding was meant to indicate. Pilots have sometimes confused the landing gear <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> with the stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> In other cases, pilots cannot hear the horn on older aircraft due to wearing a modern noise-canceling headset.|$|R
50|$|The {{emergency}} caught both pilots by surprise. There was {{confusion and}} shock {{on the flight}} deck, a situation compounded by the extremely loud noise from the overspeeding propellers. About four seconds after the double propeller overspeed began, the beta <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> started to sound intermittently, although the pilots stated afterwards they did not hear it.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 January 1970, an Aspen Airways Convair CV-240-12 (registration N270L) {{landed on}} the runway with its landing gear raised. The pilot in command {{wanted to keep the}} {{airspeed}} above 130 knots in case a go-around was required, and failed to extend the landing gear on short final. The gear <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> did not sound. There were no injuries.|$|R
500|$|Manchester Metrolink {{has many}} tramway sections, along which trams share the highway with other road traffic and pedestrians. Trams are {{equipped}} with a two-tone standard horn and a louder <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> which is primarily intended for use on former railway routes but can be used anywhere. A number of fatal incidents have occurred on the network since opening in 1992: ...|$|R
50|$|The 1967 model 172H was {{the last}} Continental O-300 powered model. It also {{introduced}} a shorter-stroke nose gear oleo to reduce drag and improve {{the appearance of the}} aircraft in flight. A new cowling was used, introducing shock-mounts that transmitted lower noise levels to the cockpit and reduced cowl cracking. The electric stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> was replaced by a pneumatic one.|$|R
50|$|TOWS is {{designed}} to sound a warning for numerous other dangerous errors in the take-off configuration, such as the flaps and slats not being extended when the throttles are opened while the aircraft is on the ground. The alert is typically {{in the form of}} an audible <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> accompanied by a voice message that indicates the nature of the configuration error.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike some Metro {{systems in}} the United Kingdom, the Manchester Metrolink has {{a high degree of}} street {{interaction}} between pedestrians and motorists with on-street running trams - this is most notable in Manchester city centre. All trams are equipped with a standard <b>horn</b> and a <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> A number of fatal incidents have occurred on the network since opening in 1992: ...|$|R
50|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, the pressure inside the cabin gradually decreased. As it passed through {{an altitude of}} 12040 ft, the cabin altitude <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded. The <b>warning</b> should have prompted the crew to stop climbing, but it was misidentified by the crew as a take-off configuration warning, which signals that {{the aircraft}} is not ready for take-off, and can only sound on the ground.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 {{a similar}} {{incident}} {{occurred on the}} Settle and Carlisle line at Crosby Garrett, north of Kirkby Stephen, where a landslide caused a Carlisle-bound Sprinter to derail. The driver set off a <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> mounted on the track, and although a southbound goods train hit the Sprinter, nobody was seriously hurt. This took place during bad weather conditions similar to the 1995 incident.|$|R
5000|$|A {{stall warning}} is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an audible warning as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn,</b> which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable metal tab that actuates a switch, and produces an audible warning in response.|$|R
5000|$|January 11, 1995: A Cessna 208 Caravan leased by FedEx Express {{and flying}} a cargo flight from Flagstaff to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport crashed about 1.3 miles SSE of Flagstaff Pulliam Airport. While {{returning}} to the airport, the [...] "fuel selector off" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> was heard. The pilot was killed. The cause of the crash {{was determined to be}} the pilot's failure to properly configure the fuel system prior to takeoff.|$|R
2500|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past , the overspeed <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at [...] until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|R
50|$|A Pan Am Boeing Stratocruiser 10-29 (N90941, named Clipper Australia) was {{on final}} for Haneda Airport when the gear was extended, showing three greens. When power was reduced prior to touchdown, the gear unsafe <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded {{and a red}} gear unsafe warning light illuminated. The captain first called for a go-around, but noticed that the {{airspeed}} was too low. The gear was retracted quickly and a belly landing was carried out. All 59 passengers and crew on board survived, but the aircraft was written off.|$|R
50|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past 16000 ft, the overspeed <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at 24800 ft until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|R
50|$|The aircraft's Take-off <b>warning</b> system <b>horn</b> was {{not heard}} on the CAM channel of the CVR. It is {{possible}} that the take-off configuration warning was not sounding.|$|R
50|$|From the CVR data, 16 {{seconds before}} the crash, the Captain called for a go-around, gear up and flaps before the crash. A <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> then sounded {{followed}} by a 'too low gear' aural sound. Apparently, the pilots had difficulty in sighting the runway and should have carried a missed approach on the Decision Altitude of 307 ft instead of continuing descent below 204 ft. The flaps were retracted and the gear was extended. But the gear was locked. The 'too low gear' warning then appeared again, and a Ground Proximity Warning System followed.|$|R
50|$|The FDR and the CVR {{were found}} {{and sent to}} Washington to be read out by the NTSB in United States. They were found in good condition; however, the team {{experienced}} difficulty reading the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM). The team {{also found that the}} channel from the CAM was masked by hum and noise dominating the signal. There were some voices heard on the CAM track; {{there were a number of}} step changes in background noise level and character that may have been consistent with an intermittent electrical connection in the CAM wiring circuit. As a result, the team was not able to conclude that the CAM was providing input to the CVR throughout the entire 30 minutes. Such a poor quality in CVR record failure makes it impossible to find out whether the flight crews made proper take-off configuration procedures including checklist execution. However several crew words, cockpit switch activations, engine noise, and cabin chime sounds heard on the CAM channel of the CVR were typically at a volume level much lower than the standard take off <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> of the Boeing 737-200. The typical sound of the take-off configuration warning was not heard in the CVR CAM channel. The stick-shaker warning (typically as loud as or louder than the takeoff <b>warning</b> <b>horn)</b> was also not heard on the CVR CAM channel.|$|R

2500|$|The stall {{characteristics}} are also relatively benign, being described by Flight International as [...] "probably the most docile of any aircraft I can remember". On the DA42, stall conditions are forewarned by the sounding of a <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> at 5-7kt above stall, {{as well as}} by elevating levels of airframe buffeting and a 5–10° drop of the nose. The aircraft is relatively difficult to stall outside of substantial mishandling or deliberate intention. Both longitudinal and lateral stability can be maintained with a relatively low level of effort, not necessitating continuous trimming while the aircraft is accelerating. Active use of the rudder is necessary for effective turns and counteracting sideslip tendencies.|$|R
50|$|Devices to {{warn the}} pilot when the aircraft's speed is {{decreasing}} close to the stall speed include stall <b>warning</b> <b>horns</b> (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), stick shakers, and voice warnings. Most stalls {{are a result of}} the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time. Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the stall speed, not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice.|$|R

500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, signals passed at danger (SPADs) were {{increasingly}} {{perceived as a}} significant danger to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each distant signal {{was accompanied by a}} ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted [...] "clear", an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby sounding a bell in the cab. With the signal at danger, the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{without an}} instant's <b>warning,</b> von <b>Horn</b> drew his gun, wheeled, and fired point-blank, first {{at one of}} his companions, then at the other.

25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it.|$|R

25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with European Union regulatory requirements. Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine intake air temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|R
40|$|SummaryPersistent {{mechanical}} hypersensitivity {{that occurs}} in the setting of injury or disease remains a major clinical problem {{largely because the}} underlying neural circuitry is still not known. Here we report the functional identification of key components of the elusive dorsal <b>horn</b> <b>circuit</b> for mechanical allodynia. We show that the transient expression of VGLUT 3 by a discrete population of neurons in the deep dorsal horn is required for mechanical pain and that activation of the cells in the adult conveys mechanical hypersensitivity. The cells, which receive direct low threshold input, point to a novel location for circuit initiation. Subsequent analysis of c-Fos reveals the circuit extends dorsally to nociceptive lamina I projection neurons, and includes lamina II calretinin neurons, which we show also convey mechanical allodynia. Lastly, using inflammatory and neuropathic pain models, we show that multiple microcircuits in the dorsal horn encode this form of pain...|$|R
