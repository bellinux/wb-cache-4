25|$|Her {{original}} {{power was}} nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gallilee {{turned to}} her niece, and {{proceeded}} quietly with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{gave her}} {{a little time to}} compose herself; and then asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|Guy {{was still}} awake, and able <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{tell him about}} Philip.|$|R
60|$|Everyone looked rather {{blank and}} amazed, except the Story Girl. <b>She</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, and <b>she</b> did it.|$|R
60|$|She locked {{her door}} and opened her writing-desk. Knowing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>she</b> tried to collect herself and do it.|$|R
60|$|There, Lucy {{found herself}} {{at a loss}} how to express <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> next--and took refuge in silence.|$|E
60|$|Anne rose. At a {{sign from}} Geoffrey, the servant and the lad {{waited in the}} room to hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, but {{she wishes}} {{you would have}} heard <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the supposing Ida to have gone in that direction.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can I, with my face swollen {{as it is}} now? Besides, {{what would}} be the good? What can I say to her? I know well enough <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say to me, without {{listening}} to it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Horace dissented widely {{from his}} friend's opinion. [...] "It's {{an insult to}} Grace," [...] he broke out, warmly, [...] "to hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have put}} your case admirably," [...] I remarked. [...] "If Madame is sincere, I {{should at least}} like <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mountjoy {{replied that}} {{he was ready to}} hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She at once stepped up to him, and {{addressed}} him in these words: ...|$|E
60|$|The Grand Master had {{collected}} the suffrages, {{and now in}} a solemn tone demanded of Rebecca <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> against the sentence of condemnation, which {{he was about to}} pronounce.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, {{and listened to}} him, {{as if he was}} {{speaking}} to her in an unknown tongue, and went on with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> as quietly as ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Mrs. Vimpany can put <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{say to us}} into few words," [...] Fanny replied, [...] "we shall {{hear from}} her to-morrow by telegraph." ...|$|R
60|$|I then {{showed her}} a small plan of Harmer Place, which I had drawn from my {{recollection}} of it, and Sarah understood perfectly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] she laughed; [...] "I have no superstitions. I {{will go in}} {{and hear}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." [...] And leaving him, she entered the tent.|$|R
60|$|He made {{an effort}} to rise then and there. With some difficulty, Carrie induced him to lie down again. He listened to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with evident impatience, and then shook his head.|$|E
60|$|Madam Rachel saw, {{while she}} was speaking, that Dwight did not look sullen and dissatisfied, but good-natured and pleasant; and so {{she knew that he}} had {{concluded}} to listen, candidly, to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Her {{resolute}} eyes {{rested on}} him with a look which said plainly, [...] "I mean to be heard." [...] He {{followed her into the}} sitting-room, and waited in sullen submission to hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!--she understands <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do,--nobody better," [...] rejoined Leah significantly; [...] "and it is {{not every}} one could fill her shoes--not for all the money she gets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{she said}} firmly, [...] "Klara {{shall not be}} silent, Andor. Let go her arm and let her speak. I want <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{must have}} {{climbed into the}} cart when I left the town," [...] he said; [...] "but waken her, wife, and we will hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And pray {{what came}} {{of her at}} last?" [...] said I, for I was willing to hear a little (seeing she would talk of it) <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> as well of Amy as of myself.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed a}} long time before Cecily had {{anything}} to say, and then <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she said in a softened, indistinct voice. [...] "You're very kind," [...] she said, and kept hold of the little photograph.|$|E
6000|$|The {{captain had}} listened to all this because he very much wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but now he exclaimed: [...] "Do you suppose I shall pay any {{attention}} to all the gossip about my affairs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite {{disgusted with}} her, papa,' said Fanny. 'I really don't see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{do with my}} marriage. Let her keep to her own matrimonial projects--if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> any.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he told himself, [...] "I don't think I {{can blame}} her, after all, and with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{say it would}} hurt if I kept her waiting." ...|$|R
60|$|Janey said no more, {{and fell}} <b>to</b> {{thinking}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer Daisy; for both took {{great pride in}} the pretty girl, who was the queen among her young friends.|$|R
60|$|Eunice neither moved nor answered. Having {{some doubt}} {{of what might}} happen if the two girls {{remained}} together, I proposed to Helena to leave the garden and to let me hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "She did it; {{she came}} back, and fanned me. I {{submitted}} {{as long as}} I could--and then I begged her not to trouble herself any longer. She put down the fan, and went on with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{took her}} hands {{suddenly}} from his shoulders, and pressed them both upon her side; while in her face, not like itself - {{and in her}} figure, drawn up, resolute to finish by a last effort <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> - the feelings long suppressed broke loose.|$|E
60|$|She bowed, {{her heart}} thumping {{almost as much}} as the father's, in the {{importance}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell, and the doubt how much <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a right <b>to</b> speak without betrayal.|$|R
60|$|Hetty seemed concerned, and {{she looked}} furtively about her as if unwilling any one but a child should hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> communicate, and even that she should learn it abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't b'lieve Eureka {{would do}} such a dreadful thing!" [...] cried Dorothy, much distressed. [...] "Go and get my kitten, please, Jellia, and we'll hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say about it." ...|$|R
