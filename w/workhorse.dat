5|$|There are few draft-type Finnhorse family lines left, {{and only}} an {{estimated}} {{two or three}} hundred animals {{are known to be}} used as actual workhorses in the 21st century. However, interest in traditional uses and methods has been increasing, and <b>workhorse</b> competitions are regularly held which usually include horse pulling or ploughing contests.|$|E
5|$|Bewick's last wood engraving, Waiting for Death, was {{of an old}} bony <b>workhorse,</b> {{standing}} forlorn by a tree stump, {{which he}} had seen and sketched as an apprentice; the work echoes William Hogarth's last work, The Bathos, which shows the fallen artist by a broken column. He died after a few days' illness on 8 November 1828, at his home. He was buried in Ovingham churchyard, beside his wife Isabella, who had died two years earlier, and not far from his parents and his brother John.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding experienced a revival, and {{the consumption of}} horse meat continued to decrease. On March 11, 1994, the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a <b>workhorse</b> again, and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses. Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France, with some going to Italy, Belgium and Germany, mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons. A few are sent to Sicily and Guadeloupe, but this is quite rare.|$|E

40|$|Norway is an {{industrialised country}} with a highly {{mechanised}} agriculture so few draft animals are used by farmers. However, the income of Norwegian farmers is falling {{and there is a}} growing focus on the ecological impact of farming. This has caused some farmers to start using work horses again. The government supports projects that lead to a wider public acceptance of <b>workhorses</b> as an alternative to tractors. One agricultural school includes the use of <b>workhorses</b> in its compulsory curriculum. This is only a beginning: major demands have to be met before a significant number of farmers begin to use <b>workhorses</b> again...|$|R

5|$|Each year, the Trait du Nord is {{honored at}} an {{agricultural}} show and horse show in Paris. In 1995, the breed won the International <b>Workhorse</b> Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010, a Trait du Nord {{took the first}} place prize for weight pulling at the show. Trait du Nord teams participate in the Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century. The race takes place {{every two or three}} years and is the biggest equine relay race in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of three}} {{separate}} sets of valve gear on the 1930 batch eased maintenance and improved the standardisation of parts. The prototype was rebuilt {{to the same}} specification as the 1930 batch, creating a robust <b>workhorse</b> capable of a good turn of speed when working heavy passenger and freight trains. The revised valve gear layout was subsequently applied to the 3-cylinder U1 and Vclass designs. The relatively early withdrawal of the N1s pre-dated the era of preservationists buying withdrawn locomotives from scrap dealers or British Railways, and consequently no examples of the N1class survived into preservation.|$|E
