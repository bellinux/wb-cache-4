Rae also said that non-university individuals {{would be forced to}} bear the tax burden needed to sustain a freeze/lowering. Supporters also asserted that a university education <b>would</b> primarily <b>benefit</b> the individual rather than being a public good.|$|R

5|$|Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services <b>would</b> <b>benefit</b> from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, {{despite the fact that}} two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose of}} army cooperation.|$|E

5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view.

He felt that with this approach everyone <b>would</b> <b>benefit</b> at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E
