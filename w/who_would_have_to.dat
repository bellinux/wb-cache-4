5|$|Anyone who had {{a horrible}} appearance, was missing a finger, or had {{appendages}} {{similar to those of}} an animal was believed to be a vampire. A person who died alone and unseen would become a vampire, likewise if a corpse swelled or turned black before burial. Dogs, cats, plants or even agricultural tools could become vampires; pumpkins or melons kept in the house too long would start to move, make noises or show blood. According to the late Serbian ethnologist Tatomir Vukanović, Roma people in Kosovo believed that vampires were invisible to most people, but could be seen by a twin brother and sister born on a Saturday who wore their clothes inside out. Likewise, a settlement could be protected by finding twins who could also see the vampire outdoors at night, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> flee immediately after they spotted it.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E

5|$|In the November general {{election}} Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes. In {{the final days}} of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17. This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments, as did Holmes and other Democrats. Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election. That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878. Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education. After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resign to become governor. Hatfield appointed Howell Appling, Jr. to the office, and O'Hara challenged the appointment in state court. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue, with the appointment of Appling confirmed. He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid {{returned}} to the United States to replace Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary as Commander Eastern Sea Frontier and Commander Sixteenth Fleet, making {{his home in the}} historic Quarters A, Brooklyn Navy Yard. He served on a board chaired by Fleet Admiral Halsey which also included Admirals Spruance, Towers and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, whose task was to nominate 50 of the 215 serving rear admirals for early retirement. Kinkaid was soon facing this fate himself, when the House Armed Services Committee sought {{to reduce the number of}} four-star rank officers in 1947. Kinkaid was one of three admirals, the others being Spruance and Hewitt, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> retire or be reduced in rank to rear admiral. After some lobbying, this was averted, and they were permitted to remain in the grade until 1 July 1950, past Kinkaid's retirement age. Retirement ceremonies, including a parade through New York City, were held on 28 April 1950 and Kinkaid formally retired two days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{selected}} {{project was}} a spin-off {{that was being}} developed by an inexperienced team under director Kazuhiro Aoyama. The spin-off was originally intended to introduce a new character <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> escape from an infected Raccoon City. However, after the promotion, Capcom decided that Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine would be the main character and Raccoon City would be destroyed. Unlike {{the majority of the}} early scripts in the series, the scenario of the game was not created by Capcom's Flagship studio but by internal Capcom writer Yasuhisa Kawamura, who had very little experience with the Resident Evil series at the time. Kawamura noted that he had to play the original game to familiarize himself with the series' fictional universe immediately. Nevertheless, the story was proofread and sanctioned by Flagship to avoid continuity errors with other installments in the series, an issue that was also given attention in monthly meetings between all directors and producers.|$|E

5|$|Jock Stein {{had been}} the manager of Scotland since the {{resignation}} of Ally MacLeod in 1978, and had managed to ensure qualification for the 1982 World Cup in Spain. However, over the period there had been little other success, either in the European Championships, which Scotland had failed to qualify for twice, or the British Home Championship, which had led to criticism leading into the next competition, the 1986 World Cup. As a consequence, Stein was facing significant pressure to ensure qualification for his team for the tournament, given the route that have been provided to Scotland by the qualifying draw. Group 7 {{was one of three}} UEFA qualifying groups with only four teams – in each of these groups, the second placed teams would advance to a play-off round. For the second placed team in Group 7, this meant a two-legged play-off against the winner of the OFC tournament, likely to be Australia, which was seen as a much easier proposition than the runners up in Group 1 and Group 5, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face each other. As a consequence, the defeat to Wales in Glasgow had led to significant criticism directed at Stein, who was aware that failure to get a result against Wales would likely cost him his job. He was not helped by the fact that a number of his senior players, including Graeme Souness (his captain), Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and Steve Archibald would all miss the game through injury or suspension. Stein was also taking diuretics to manage heart failure at the time but had, in the build-up to the game, decided to stop taking them to try and remained focused and negate any potential side-effects the medication might have. Despite his enthusiasm for the job and for football, the strain on Stein, combined with his poor health, had led to him indicating that he would step down after the World Cup Finals in Mexico.|$|E

He made 27 in their opening win against Afghanistan but was out for 2 as England were thrashed by India, but still {{qualified}} in second place. He hit 71 runs of just 36 against the West Indies in the first match of the Super Eight stage. Despite his efforts, England still lost by 15 runs. He hit 30 against New Zealand as England won to keep their hopes of qualification alive. However, England lost to Sri Lanka by seven wickets meaning that their hopes of progressing were over as they were knocked out of the competition.|$|E
25|$|Plans for Stord Airport, Sørstokken were {{launched}} in the early 1980s. Thus the plans for a bridge crossing Stokksundet were again raised in 1982, this time by the industry on Bømlo, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel by ferry to reach the new airport. A committee was established in May 1983, which gave Engineer Harald Møyner the assignment of producing a new report. He launched three proposals: a pontoon or suspension bridge between Foldrøyholmen and Litlaneset; a suspension bridge between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate {{just south of the}} new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago.

25|$|The Japanese were {{assigned}} the Zhejiang city of Ningbo as their {{port of entry}} into China, and were allowed to present tribute once every 10 years. These Japanese missions to Ming China continued up to Japan's Sengoku period, when the hold of the Ashikaga shogunate waned and power became divided by the warring regional daimyo. These internecine feuds reached China in the Ningbo Incident of 1523, when traders from the Ōuchi clan fought {{with those of the}} Hosokawa clan in Ningbo for the right to present tribute, which spiralled out of hand and resulted in the widespread pillage of Ningbo. When a Ming fleet appeared onto the scene to restore peace, the fleet was defeated instead and the Japanese traders got away. After this episode, the Ming banned all Japanese from trading in Ningbo, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> join the pirates on offshore islands in order to trade Chinese goods.|$|E
25|$|The exiled Queen went to Milan {{where she}} had an {{interview}} with Napoleon. He promised her, as compensation {{for the loss of}} Etruria, the throne of a Kingdom of Northern Lusitania (in the North of Portugal), he intended to create after the Franco-Spanish conquest of Portugal. This was part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau between France and Spain (October 1807) that also had incorporated Etruria to Napoleons' domains. Napoleon had already ordered the invasion of Portugal but his secret aim was ultimately to depose the Spanish royal family and have access to the money remitted from Spanish colonies in the New World. As part of the agreement, Maria Luisa would marry Lucien Bonaparte, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> divorce his wife, but both refused: Lucien was attached to his wife and Maria Luisa considered those nuptials a misalliance, and she would not allow herself to be put in Portugal in the place of her eldest sister, Carlota. Napoleon wanted Maria Luisa to settle in Nice or Turin, but her intentions were to join her parents in Spain. She arrived at a court deeply divided and a country in unrest: her brother, Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias, had plotted against their father and the unpopular prime minister Manuel Godoy.|$|E

500|$|In 1904, O'Reily {{travelled}} Europe to {{make his}} ad limina visit to Rome, and to visit his native Ireland where he was made a freeman of Kilkenny. Due to poor health, from 1905, O'Reily kept to himself in his house in Glen Osmond, leading to the local press referring {{to him as the}} [...] "Recluse of Glen Osmond".

500|$|The Flames {{struggled}} in 2009–10, failing {{to qualify for}} the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2003. Iginla accepted responsibility for the team's failure, admitting that finishing around 70points for the season was [...] "not enough". The Flames' declining fortunes and Iginla's season led to increasing questions on whether he could be traded from the team with whom he has played his entire NHL career. Iginla, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> approve any trade the team attempts to make due to a no-movement clause in his contract, expressed that he did not wish to leave Calgary, but would accommodate a trade if the Flames wished to do so. Former Flames' general manager Craig Button argued against trading Iginla, blaming a lack of complementary players for both Iginla and Calgary's failures: [...] "There's nothing easier in hockey than to be able to shut down one player. And the Calgary Flames, I would argue, have made it really easy for teams to shut down Jarome." [...] The Flames publicly stated that they had no plans to trade him.|$|E

500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century a private company, the Spring Valley Water Company (SVWC), owned much of the Alameda Creek Watershed and had held a {{monopoly}} on water service to San Francisco. In 1906, William Bowers Bourn II, a major stockholder in the SVWC, {{and owner of the}} giant Empire gold mine, hired Willis Polk to design a [...] "water temple" [...] atop the spot where three subterranean water sources converge (a pipe from the Arroyo de la Laguna, Alameda Creek, through the Sunol infiltration galleries, and a 30-inch pipeline from the artesian well field of Pleasanton) [...] Some sources claim Bourn wanted to sell the water company to the City of San Francisco and saw the temple as a way to appeal to San Francisco voters, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> approve the purchase (municipal efforts to buy out the SVWC had been a source of constant controversy from as early as 1873, when the first attempt to purchase it was turned down by the voters because the price was too high).
