A political scientist Maurice Duverger found an inspiration for a new type of the political system in the emergence of the new republic. Duverger's theory of semi-presidentialism became the fundemental for further study and it became a model for many emerging regimes. The main aim of the thesis is to analyze <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> position in <b>the</b> French semi-presidential political system. The theoretical part of the thesis describes an essence of the semi-presidentialism, its characteristics and <b>the</b> role that <b>president</b> plays in this system. The empirical part focuses on <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> constitutionally enshrined powers and it outlines the reforms that {{had an impact on the}} institution of <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> This part also answers <b>the</b> question <b>why</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> influence depends so much on his relationship with the prime minister...|$|R

40|$|How do {{domestic}} political conditions shape when leaders get punished for backing down in international crises? We explore how three factors—the <b>president’s</b> partisanship, <b>the</b> reaction of other elites, and whether <b>the</b> <b>president</b> justifies his {{decision on the}} basis of new information—influence the size of domestic audience costs. While standard theories in American politics suggest that partisanship should exert a large effect over voter behavior, we offer an alternative theory explaining <b>why</b> <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> unique informational advantage following a crisis will mute partisanship’s effect on audience costs. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> justification for <b>why</b> he backed down, however, will have a large effect on audience costs. Using a series of original survey experiments, we find strong support for our theoretical argument. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the role of partisanship, framing, and the audience costs literature more broadly.

60|$|Putney {{carried the}} laugh against Gerrish, {{but there were}} some of the group, and there were many people in Hatboro', {{including}} most of the women, who felt the want of exemplary measures in dealing with Northwick's case. These ladies did not see the sense of letting those girls live on just as if nothing had happened, in a house that their father's crimes had forfeited to his victims, while plenty of honest people did not know where they were going to sleep that night, or where the next mouthful of victuals was to come from. It was not really the houseless and the hungry who complained of this injustice; it was not even those who toiled for their daily bread in the Hatboro' shops who said such things. They were too busy, and then too tired, to think much about them, and the noise of Northwick's misdeeds died first amid the din of machinery. It was in the close, stove-heated parlors of the respectable citizens, behind the windows that had so long commanded envious views of the Northwicks going by in their carriages and sledges, and among women of leisure and conscience, that his infamy endured, and that the injuries of his creditors cried out for vengeance on those daughters of his; they had always thought themselves too good to speak to other folks. Such women could not understand what the Ponkwasset Mills Company meant by not turning those girls right out of doors, and perhaps they could not have been taught why the company had no power to do this, or <b>why</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> at least, had no wish to do it. When they learned that his family still kept up friendly relations with the Northwick girls, they were not without their suspicions, which were not long in becoming their express belief, that the Hilarys were sharing in the booty. They were not cruel, and would not really have liked to see the Northwick girls suffer, if it had come to that; but they were greedy of the vengeance promised upon the wicked, and they had no fear of judging or of meting with the fullest measure.|$|E
