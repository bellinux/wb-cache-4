500|$|Arthur Vaughan Williams died {{suddenly}} in February 1875, and his widow took {{the children to}} live in her family home, Leith Hill Place, Wotton, Surrey. The children were {{under the care of}} a nurse, Sara Wager, who instilled in them not only polite manners and good behaviour but also liberal social and philosophical opinions. Such views were consistent with the progressive-minded tradition of both sides of the family. When the young Vaughan Williams asked his mother about Darwin's controversial book On the Origin of Species, she answered, [...] "The Bible says that God made the world in six days. Great Uncle Charles thinks it took longer: but <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> worry about it, for it is equally wonderful either way".|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Singer Charulatha Mani wrote for The Hindu on [...] "Nalandhana" [...] that, [...] "...one {{can feel the}} proximity in musicality. The Thavil beats, Nadaswara refrains and the honeyed voice all blend into an inviting melody composed by K.V. Mahadevan." [...] For [...] "Maraindhirundhu" [...] she said, [...] "The nadaswaram and thavil back-ups for this song and the jathi-s give it its typical classical flavour. 'Thooyane mayavaa mayane velava ennai aalum Shanmuga vaa'– these lines represent the ideal confluence of raga, bhava and lyric, a perfect foil to each other." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen in their Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, referred to [...] "Nalandhana" [...] as [...] " [...] major song hit". According [...] to film critic Randor Guy, [...] "Nalandhana" [...] became [...] "one of the memorable song sequences with Sivaji Ganesan and AVM Rajan, playing the [...] on screen". P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] {{does not need to}} know the language to sing a song perfectly, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Nalandaana... Thillana Mohanambal [...] )".|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, literary critic David Rannie praised the poems as a whole: [...] "that strange little lovely group, which breathe a passion unfamiliar to Wordsworth, and about which he—so ready to talk about the genesis of his poems—has told us nothing [...] Let a poet keep some of his secrets: <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> grudge him the privacy when the poetry is as beautiful as this; when there is such celebration of girlhood, love, and death [...] The poet's sense of loss is sublime in its utter simplicity. He finds harmony rather than harshness in the contrast between the illusion of love and the fact of death." [...] Later critics focused on the importance of the poems to Wordsworth's poetic technique. Durrant argued that [...] "The four 'Lucy' poems which appeared in the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads are worth careful attention, because they represent the clearest examples of the success of Wordsworth's experiment." [...] Alan Grob (1932–2007) focused less on the unity that the poems represent and believed that [...] "the principal importance of the 'Matthew' and 'Lucy' poems, apart from their intrinsic achievement, substantial as that is, is in suggesting the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth's thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and contributed to}} the film's success. Film historian and columnist Randor Guy approved of the music, considering [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] to have [...] "excellent background orchestration". Film critic Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express, opined that [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] had set [...] "the precedent for several generations of jilted lovers". On [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana", singer Charulatha Mani wrote, [...] "The subtle pathos that P. Susheela imparts when she sings 'sol sol..en uyire' is notable." [...] P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] does not need to know the language to sing a song perfectly, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Sonnathu neethanaa... Nenjil Oru Aalayam [...] )". Rajadhyaksha and Willemen called [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] "a classic number about unrequited love." [...] Following Viswanathan's death in July 2015, the news agency, Press Trust of India wrote that [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] was [...] "memorable for the deep sense of solace it offered to wounded hearts." [...] Anand Venkateswaran of The Wire noted, [...] "MSV’s style is less about making words sit in a meter than about a musical empathy with the meaning. Could anyone else have set to tune the first line of ‘Sonnadhu nee daana‘, of Nenjil Or Alayam (Muthuraman, 1962)?" [...] A critic from Dina Thanthi noted Kannadasan had an uncanny ability to deliver perfect situational songs and cited [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana" [...] as an example.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{positive response}} from critics; {{all the songs}} were successful, especially [...] "Engey Nimmadhi". Film historian Randor Guy stated, [...] "The movie has excellent music (Viswanathan-Ramamurthy; lyrics by Kannadasan) and many songs became hits— Paartha Gnaabakam Illayo...!, Unnai ondru ketpen (...) and Engey nimmathee (T. M. Soundararajan)." [...] Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said, [...] "Who can forget the everlasting flavour of MSV’s expertise that emanated through each and every number, beginning with ‘Unnai Ondru Kaetpaen’!" [...] Film critic Baradwaj Rangan called it a [...] "stylish musical bonanza". According to singer Charulatha Mani, [...] "Unnai Ondru Ketpen" [...] {{was based on the}} Harikambhoji raaga and further wrote, [...] "In the phrase, ‘Ennai Pada Sonnal’, the notes SRGR,S S,N set the mood for the raga." [...] whilst also calling the song a [...] "super-hit piece". Music director and singer Ramesh Vinayakam said [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] was an example of [...] "the unconscious yet natural and healthy fusion that was happening to cinema music at the hands of music directors." [...] The Hindu included [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] in its list, [...] "Immortal songs of TMS". P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] does not need to know the language to sing a song perfectly, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Chittukkuruvi... Puthiya Paravai [...] )". The Times of India noted, [...] "Think any of Sivaji Ganesan's songs and you'll immediately think of the film. Be it the seductive club song Partha Nyabagam Illayo (Pudhiya Paravai)... the songs in his films were perfectly in sync with the sequence." ...|$|E

500|$|Keats's {{use of the}} odal hymn in his six odes, {{along with}} {{his use of the}} odal hymn with a responsal voice in [...] "Ode to a Grecian Urn" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", created, {{according}} to Walter Jackson Bate, [...] "a new tone for the English lyric." [...] Bate, when speaking about the 1819 odes, wrote: [...] "The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer. Yet to Keats it was not even a new beginning. It was rather a matter of becoming more alive in preparation for the next beginning." [...] In addition to this, Bate argued that [...] "It is because [...] "To Autumn" [...] is so uniquely a distillation, and at many different levels, that each generation has found {{it one of the most}} nearly perfect poems in English. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> be afraid of continuing to use the adjective [...] The 'Ode to a Nightingale,' for example, is a less 'perfect' though a greater poem." [...] Charles Patterson argued the relationship of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats, [...] "The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of [...] "To Autumn" [...] but is much superior in these qualities to the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Later, Ayumi Mizukoshi argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] drew neither attention nor admiration. Herbert Grierson believed [...] "Nightingale" [...] to be superior to the other odes because it and [...] "To Autumn" [...] were more logical and contained stronger arguments. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E
