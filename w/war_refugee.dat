5|$|By 1931, Fraser had {{successfully}} passed her medical examinations and become licensed. Two years later, Fraser became a part-time lecturer {{and then in}} 1934 was promoted to full-time lecturer in the department. Around the same time, in 1933, Williams moved to the farm full-time, returning to Toronto only on weekends. In 1937, she was finally accepted into the Ontario Veterinary College and that same year, Fraser's mother died. Williams graduated in 1941 and she began practicing as a veterinarian. For the first time, the two women acquired a home together, living in Toronto. They took in a foster child, Jenny Rodd, a <b>war</b> <b>refugee</b> from England, who remained with them until the war ended. Rising homophobia during the war-years, which carried into the 1950s and 1960s led the couple to hide the intimate nature of their relationship from their ward and present an ambiguous relationship to the greater society, limiting their social life to those who knew them best.|$|E

An official government emissary sent to Turkey was of considerable assistance in the rescue of Romanian Jewry. The WRB saved about 200,000 Jews. Those rescued through the WRB were probably mostly in Hungary, in part through the Raoul Wallenberg mission which was sponsored by the WRB.|$|E

In 1943, Morgenthau's Treasury Department {{approved}} the World Jewish Congress' plan to rescue Jews {{through the use of}} blocked accounts in Switzerland, but the State Department and the British Foreign Office procrastinated further. Morgenthau and his staff persisted in bypassing State and ultimately confronting Roosevelt in January 1944. He obtained the presidential creation of the US <b>War</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board in January 1944. The Board sponsored the Raoul Wallenberg mission to Budapest and allowed an increasing number of Jews to enter the U.S. in 1944 and 1945; as many as 200,000 Jews were saved in this way.|$|E

In spring 1944, President Roosevelt dispatched US Treasury Department official Iver C. Olsen to Stockholm {{as a representative of the}} WRB. Olsen was tasked specifically by the President with finding a way to aid the Hungarian Jews. This, however, was not the sole reason for Olsen being posted to Sweden. In addition to his duties with the WRB, Olsen was also secretly functioning as the chief of currency operations for the Stockholm branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the United States' wartime espionage service.|$|E

2500|$|Hurwitz (1991) {{argues that}} in late 1943, the Treasury Department drafted a report {{calling for the}} {{creation}} of a special rescue agency for European Jewry. At the same time, several congressmen connected with the [...] "Bergson Boys" [...] introduced a resolution also calling {{for the creation of}} such an agency. On January 16, 1944, Morgenthau presented Roosevelt with the Treasury report, and the president agreed to create the <b>War</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board (WRB), the first major attempt of the United States to deal with the annihilation of European Jews.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, some historians have {{attempted}} to re-examine and evaluate the significance of his activities during World War II and {{his role as a}} political opponent of Begin. One allegation is that Kook's adversaries in Israel and America downplayed some of his accomplishments and minimized their own role in curtailing his activities. David Wyman and Rafael Medoff, co-authors of a 2002 Kook biography, suggested that despite the frequent obstruction by the modern American Jewish establishment Kook's rescue group's activism was the major factor in establishment of the <b>War</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board and that it was an instrument rescuing approximately 200,000, partly by means of the [...] Raoul Wallenberg mission.|$|E

2500|$|However, at the Bermuda Refugee Conference in 1943, {{both the}} United States and Britain refused to relax their {{immigration}} policies, {{not even for}} British Mandatory Palestine. In reaction, the WJC published a comment which said: [...] "The truth is that what {{stands in the way}} of aid to the Jews in Europe by the United Nations is not that such a program is dangerous, but simple lack of will to go to any trouble on their behalf." [...] Only in January 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the setting up of the <b>War</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board, whose purpose was to [...] "rescue victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death".|$|E
2500|$|After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt helped {{expedite}} Jewish {{immigration from}} Germany and allowed Austrian and German citizens {{already in the}} United States to stay indefinitely. He was prevented from accepting more Jewish immigrants by the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924, the prevalence of nativism and antisemitism among voters and members of Congress, and some resistance in the American Jewish community to the acceptance of Eastern European Jewish immigrants. Hitler chose to implement the [...] "Final Solution"–the extermination of Jewish population–in January 1942, and American officials learned of {{the scale of the}} Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the ongoing Holocaust and promised to try its perpetrators as war criminals. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the <b>War</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed {{that the best way to}} help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt himself.|$|E
