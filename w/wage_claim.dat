50|$|In 1864, the grinders' union {{issued a}} <b>wage</b> <b>claim.</b> This was ignored, {{and when a}} new claim the {{following}} year was also passed over, they joined with the smiths' union, {{the largest in the}} town, in calling a strike in February 1866. Some large employers retaliated by installing file cutting machines. The Association's attempt to mediate failed, and the employers rejected a compromise. In order to bolster the strike, the Association appealed for funds from trades {{in other areas of the}} country, and having received some, it agreed a proposal from the Wolverhampton Trades Council to hold a national conference. The strike was lost in June, but the conference went ahead.|$|E

[...] Although that was not the cause of the dispute, it became essential to the settlement of the dispute. [...] In the 1960s, employment in coal mining had fallen by almost 400,000 with little resistance from the NUM leadership, but the left wing of the union was becoming stronger and drawing strength from the students' protests. When miners staged a protest in London to support their <b>wage</b> <b>claim,</b> many Londoners were surprised that there were still coal mines operating in Britain. The NUM leadership of Sidney Ford was regarded by many within the union as having been too passive and accommodating of a Labour government.|$|E

This paper focuses on these problems, highlighting the dynamic links between wage behavior, the fiscal deficit, inflation, and the capital stock. The fiscal impact of higher wages works through the reduction in public enterprises' profits and, hence, government revenues from profit taxes. If <b>wage</b> and tax <b>claims</b> on firms' revenue are 'too high,' capital can be run down until <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> are moderated by the fall in output.

50|$|KSUA's {{fortunes}} {{began to}} decline in the late 1980s. KFAR, the predominant commercial station in Fairbanks, had a format {{for many years in}} the 1970s and 1980s of top 40 music and local news and talk. Bill Walley, the station's general manager and later owner, had resisted expanding into some of the more contemporary music trends and radio formats which had emerged during the 1980s, and in fact had in part seeded KSUA during its push to become an open air station. A combination of Walley starting KWLF in 1987 and hiring away Anderson and Evans, and the decline of the Alaskan economy during the same period, saw KSUA's status as a commercial radio entity take a sudden sharp downturn. As Fairbanks's radio market expanded with a flood of new stations in the early 1990s, acute financial troubles began to plague KSUA. The station's advertising revenues steadily declined amidst an increasingly competitive broadcasting landscape. KSUA was eventually unable to meet its payroll demands to both management and on-air staff. The formerly-paid D.J.s were asked to volunteer, but in protest, one of them filed a <b>wage</b> <b>claim</b> with the Department of Labor, and KSUA was forced to give out almost $45,000 in unpaid wages. Out of money, KSUA went dark March 8, 1993.|$|E
40|$|The initial works council’s <b>wage</b> <b>claim</b> and {{the initial}} firm’s (counter) offer {{as well as the}} {{fraction}} of the disputed wages the works council is able to capture conditional on initial disagreement are analyzed {{on the basis of a}} Spanish sample of wage settlements. After a given initial <b>wage</b> <b>claim,</b> the system forces the firm either to accept it or to make a counteroffer prior to a fixed (unknown to the econometrician) and short deadline. In this context signaling models predict that the <b>wage</b> <b>claim</b> should try to screen the firm’s level of profitability, while the offer is expected to reveal little information. Both hypotheses are tested using the Spanish data set and neither is rejected. The analysis of the fraction of the disputed wages the workers get after initial disagreement provides further evidence in favour of signalling models since we find it is to both observed and private information as well as to conflicting activity variables. Moreover, conditional on covariates, for a number of sectors, we cannot reject the parties “split the difference” between both initial offers. Note this solution coincides with the Rubinstein’s (1982) wage, the solution for the complete information game. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{corporate}} governance problem of state enterprises in formerly centrally planned economies can {{give rise to}} excess <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> and/or capital decumulation if workers and managers try to appropriate the firm''s assets before it is "commercialized" or privatized. Since state enterprises still produce a dominant fraction of total output, these problems can have serious macroeconomic consequences. For example, since the profit tax accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} government fiscal revenue, a redistribution of state enterprises'' total revenue from profits to wage implies - ceteris paribus - a worsening of the government''s fiscal position. In the absence of a developed bond market, this implies higher money creation: monetary policy becomes endogenous with respect to <b>wage</b> <b>claims.</b> Also, if the claims of workers (in the form of wages) and government (in the form of taxes) exceed output, capital will be run down. This can happen, for example, if the government imposes excess wage taxes on state enterprises, but the latter are unable to keep wage increases below the limit. This paper provides a simple dynamic framework to address these issues, and studies the impact of wage controls on the behaviour of the fiscal deficit inflation, private consumption, and output in the presence of "excessive" <b>wage</b> <b>claims.</b> The latter can lead not only to high inflation, but also to suboptimally low levels of capital and putout. If wage levels are initially excessive, simple incomes policy measures, such as a reduction in the degree of wage indexation, can be effective in reducing inflation and the fiscal deficit if nominal wage increases do not provide on average full protection against inflation. Furthermore, in the presence of structurally excessive <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> and full inflation coverage, linking wages to the path of putout can help reduce the overall output decline. The endogeneity of monetary policy with respect to <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> implies that <b>wage</b> controls may be necessary to regain monetary autonomy if the Central Bank is to pursue nominal exchange rate stability or a crawling peg...|$|R

40|$|To put {{the plight}} of the Detroit city {{employees}} into an international and comparative context when it comes to considering how their pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> should be treated in bankruptcy, it is instructive to consider how similar employee pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> would be treated in corporate insolvencies in other countries. It is necessary to focus on corporate insolvencies in other countries as the relevant comparison because most other countries do not have government systems in which municipalities have the same financial independence to borrow money and take on debt as municipalities do in the United States as part of the municipal bond market. Additionally, exploring the corporate bankruptcy systems in other countries provides a beneficial way to consider how to approach municipal bankruptcy situations in the United States, especially since corporate and municipal bankruptcies in the United States have a number of features in common when it comes to employee creditor claims. This article therefore undertakes a comparative analysis of the treatment of pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> in insolvency proceedings and under guarantee schemes in the thirty-four member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to understand whether the United States’ approach to employee claims in bankruptcy (in both the corporate and municipal context) is consistent with international norms. After completing the comparative analysis (which is comprehensively set out in the Country-by-Country Appendix {{at the end of this}} paper), this article then highlights common approaches to these issues, as well as important distinctions, setting up a number of tables to summarize the results. All in all, most OECD countries have adopted hybrid systems which combine both some form of priority for both pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims,</b> as well as some form of guarantee fund to complement the insolvency system. It is especially important to have these guarantee funds in place because insolvency processes can last for years, while the guarantee schemes are more likely to pay employees their claims within weeks or months. Unfortunately, the United States provides only limited priorities in most bankruptcy proceedings (and no such wage or pension priorities in Chapter 9 municipal proceedings), a guarantee system under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) that is limited to pension plans, and then only to private-sector defined benefit pension plans. Neither private-sector defined contribution plans nor public sector pension plans come under a guarantee scheme in the United States. One possible approach to employee claims in both municipal and corporate bankruptcies would be to pass pension and bankruptcy reform laws similar to what Canada enacted in 2008 as part of its Wage Earner Protection Program Act (WEPPA). Unlike the American system, WEPPA provides limited absolute priorities for pension contributions and a broad array of <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> in insolvency, as well as a robust wage guarantee scheme. As to the policy reasons supporting this approach, it appears that greater emphasis is placed on the need to protect the weakness of employees creditors in the insolvency process as opposed to focusing on the need to ensure the existence of cheap, accessible credit for companies and governments. This article concludes that given the relative vulnerability of employees and the sophistication of most lenders, the United States should balance these interests to provide increased protection for employment claims during municipal and corporate insolvency proceedings through giving heightened priority treatment to employees pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> in bankruptcy in tandem with a federally-operated guarantee scheme for both pension and <b>wages</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R

40|$|In an ageing society, it is {{important}} to gain insight in the factors explaining why the transition from unemployment to employment gets harder as people move from mid to late career. This study focuses on one related aspect: individuals’ wage setting behaviour. The study explores the relationship between age and the reservation wage for people in their mid and late career. We moreover investigate whether two employability factors, ‘willingness to move’ and ‘ease of movement’, mediate this relationship. Higher <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> would not necessarily be problematic if they result from a stronger labour market position (ease of movement) and therefore a higher ‘market value’. It would be more problematic if higher <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> are a way to price oneself out of the labour market because of a low willingness to move. Path analysis on a sample of 8, 113 Belgian workers aged 40 to 60 years reveals that age positively affects the reservation wage via willingness to move. Yet, this effect is neutralized by the negative influence via ease of movement. Our analyses moreover reveal a direct, positive effect of age on the reservation wage, if employability factors are controlled for. This finding suggests that <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> are increasing if people move from mid to late career irrespective of their employability. We discuss implications for theory, practice and future research. status: publishe...|$|R
