5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> battle {{was one of the}} turning points of the 1948 Arabâ€“Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E

5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines {{whether or not}} a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses.

Further research shows that they can tell in one bite <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E

40|$|ABTSRACT Through {{leadership}} models {{offered by}} Locke et. al (1991) {{we can say}} that <b>whether</b> good <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> vision of leaders in the organization is highly dependent on <b>whether</b> good <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> motives and traits, knowledge, skill, and abilities owned leaders. Then, good <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the vision by the leader depends on <b>whether</b> good <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> motives and traits, knowledge, skills, abilities, and the vision of the leaders. Strategic Leadership written by Davies (1991) states that the implementation of the vision by using strategic leadership, the meaning is much more complete than what has been written by Locke et. al. in the fourth stage of leadership. Thus, aspects of the implementation of the vision by Locke et al (1991) it is not complete implementation of the vision according to Davies (1991). With the considerations mentioned above, this article attempts to combine the leadership model of the Locke et. al and strategic leadership of the Davies. With this modification is expected to be an improvement model of leadership is more comprehensive and parsimony...|$|R
