40|$|The {{ecosystem}} services (ES) approach is gaining broad interest in regulatory and policy arenas {{for use in}} landscape management and ecological risk assessment. It {{has the potential to}} bring greater ecological relevance to the setting of environmental protection goals and to the assessment of the ecological risk posed by chemicals. A workshop, organised {{under the auspices of the}} Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Europe, brought together scientific experts from European regulatory authorities, the chemical industry and academia to discuss and evaluate the challenges associated with implementing an ES approach to chemical ecological risk assessment (ERA). Clear advantages of using an ES approach in prospective and retrospective ERA were identified, including: making ERA spatially explicit and of relevance to management decisions (i. e. indicating what ES to protect and where); improving transparency in communicating risks and trade-offs; integrating across multiple stressors, scales, habitats and policies. A number of challenges were also identified including: the potential for increased complexity in assessments; greater data requirements; limitations in linking endpoints derived from current ecotoxicity tests to impacts on ES. In principle, the approach was applicable to all chemical sectors, but the scale of the challenge of applying an ES approach to general chemicals with <b>widespread</b> and <b>dispersive</b> <b>uses</b> leading to broad environmental exposure, was highlighted. There was agreement that ES-based risk assessment should be based on the magnitude of impact rather than on toxicity thresholds. The need for more bioassays/tests with functional endpoints was recognized, as was the role of modelling and the need for ecological production functions to link measurement endpoints to assessment endpoints. Finally, the value of developing environmental scenarios that can be combined with spatial information on exposure, ES delivery and service provider vulnerability was recognized...|$|R

During the whole life cycle of products containing these compounds, starting with the manufacturing, including the use and ending with the disposal, PFOA and its precursors might be emitted into the environment. Detection of PFOA and precursors in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents [26] {{as well as in}} air emitted from WWTPs [27 – 29] give further evidence for the wide <b>dispersive</b> <b>use</b> of PFOA and precursors.

30|$|Surfactants are {{chemicals}} {{with a high}} {{production volume}} and a wide <b>dispersive</b> <b>use,</b> i.e. surfactants have a high environmental impact. The question of the persistence of a particular substance {{is one of the}} most important aspects for the assessment of the risks associated with chemical substances (EU Technical Guidance Document, 2003). Therefore, strict legal requirements for the aerobic biodegradability of surfactants have been established on national and international level, e.g. the EU Detergent Regulation (EC/ 648 / 2004). The most common fate for surfactants is that they are discharged via waste water. Surfactant containing domestic and industrial waste water is collected and purified in professionally operated waste water treatment plants. Taking into account the strict legal requirements assuring the use of biodegradable surfactants, the vast majority of surfactant molecules entering a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) are readily broken down to CO 2 and H 2 O. Only a very small fraction of the surfactants is not aerobically broken down during the usual hydraulic retention times of modern WWTPs. This fraction, due to the predominantly hydrophobic nature of surfactants, adheres to the sludge. The sludge is usually collected and further treated under anaerobic conditions in digester tanks. Therefore, the knowledge about anaerobic biodegradability under digester tank conditions is important to gain an understanding about the environmental fate of surfactants. Unfortunately, no standard method is available to test surfactants under these conditions.|$|R
