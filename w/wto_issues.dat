40|$|The World Trade Organization (WTO) has {{undertaken}} systemic reforms since its establishment following {{the conclusion of}} the Uruguay Round in 1994. Indeed, the very dynamics of the WTO negotiating processes have underdone transformations nearly unimaginable in the era of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

Sweeping improvements in transparency have led to the declassification of essentially all WTO documents to the general public at the same time of their circulation to WTO Member Governments. Of course a subset of sensitive negotiating proposals often know as “JOB” documents and “Room Documents”, which are normally circulated only at formal and informal WTO meetings, remain restricted and are not available on the public version of the WTO website.

Prior to the law, the Indonesian Council of Ulama (MUI) oversaw voluntary Halal certification. While Islamic organizations in Indonesia have praised the emergence of this law, local and foreign business entities have expressed their anxiety over whether such requirements would mean extra costs for them.

40|$|In the Doha Round {{of trade}} negotiations, {{it has been}} {{acknowledged}} that agriculture has a special {{role to play in}} developing countries and non-trade concerns like food security, livelihood security and issues related to rural development should be given priority over trade liberalization. To enable developing countries take account of their developmental needs, two new defensive instruments have been proposed in the current round of negotiations on agriculture. First, it has been decided that developing countries will have the flexibility to designate an appropriate number of products as Special Products (SP) which will be eligible for more flexible market access commitments. Second, to temporarily protect the domestic agriculture of developing countries from international commodity price volatility and import surges, a Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) will be made available to these countries. Both SP and SSM are new defensive instruments made available to developing countries in the Doha Round of trade talks and it will be important to analyze how these mechanisms are going to help developing countries in their pursuit to protect the livelihood and food security of their farmers. This paper focuses on the SSM and analyzes its implications for developing countries. It also puts forth specific suggestions regarding design and implementation of a price-trigger-based special safeguard mechanism. It is hoped that the working paper will help policy-makers and stakeholders to take a view on this important issue.

40|$|Abstract The {{transition}} from a command economy to a market-based economy has been remarkably successful in China. After 15 years of negotiations, China finally joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001. Because of trade and investment liberalization under the WTO, there will be greater competition between Chinese and foreign firms, both inside China and outside China. While {{there is a great}} deal of economic literature on China’s entry to the WTO, there has been no research on the global marketing impact and implications of China’s membership of the WTO. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap. The objective of this study is to examine the general impact of China’s entry to the WTO and to assess the global marketing implications of specific trade-related policy <b>issues</b> within the <b>WTO</b> framework for China.
