40|$|Abstract: Among {{the four}} basic skills in English, {{the most complex}} and {{difficult}} skill to master is probably <b>writing</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> a second or foreign language is usually even more difficult than <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> the individual’s mother tongue {{since most of the}} thinking is usually carried out in the mother tongue. And it is usually the case that a student who faces difficulty <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> ESL contexts will also face much difficulty when attempting to <b>write</b> <b>in</b> an academic context. Furthermore, the importance of learning to <b>write</b> <b>in</b> English is all the more important because of its acknowledged position as the global language of communication. Thus, the ability to <b>write</b> <b>in</b> English cannot be too emphasized...|$|R
