25|$|Ridgway {{was arrested}} in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became {{a suspect in the}} Green River killings in 1983. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a {{polygraph}} test (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body in the carpet. In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ice-T co-wrote the band's {{music and}} lyrics with lead guitarist Ernie C, and {{took on the}} duties of lead vocalist. Ice-T states that [...] "I knew I couldn't sing, but then I thought, 'Who can sing in rock 'n' roll?'" [...] Aside from Ice-T and Ernie C, the {{original}} line-up consisted of Mooseman on bass, Beatmaster V on drums and D-Roc on rhythm guitar. According to Ice-T, [...] "We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A., I'd <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports. 'Is that all I am,' I thought, 'a body count?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after he}} kidnapped her, Garrido forced Dugard into a shower with him. The {{first time he}} raped her, {{she was still in}} handcuffs, which she wore during her first week in captivity. During that period, Dugard's only human contact was Garrido, who {{sometimes}} brought her fast food and told her amusing stories. He provided a bucket for her to use to relieve herself. At one point, he provided her with a television, but she could not <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> and was unaware of the publicized search for her. Almost {{a month and a half}} after her kidnapping, by Dugard's recollection, Garrido moved her to a larger room next door, where she was handcuffed to a bed. He explained that the [...] "demon angels" [...] let him take her and that she would help him with his sexual problems because society had ignored him. He went on methamphetamine binges he called [...] "runs", during which he would dress Dugard up and spend time with her cutting out figures from pornographic magazines. He made her listen for the voices he said he could hear from the walls. Garrido also often professed the belief that he was a chosen servant of God. These binges would end with him sobbing and apologizing to Dugard alternating with threats to sell her to people who would put her in a cage.|$|E

2500|$|Rubio's {{reviews from}} {{students}} have been positive, even from students who disagree with him politically. He generally gives the impression of being unbiased and nonpartisan, and when offering his own opinion identifies it as such.

2500|$|Overall, {{the series}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail {{said that the}} show is neither the new M*A*S*H for its lack of [...] "snarky chat about the stupidity of war and governments that encourage war" [...] nor is it Grey's Anatomy-on-the-front-lines as there are no [...] "lurid romantic entanglements". Doyle goes on to say, [...] "It's the horrors {{of war and the}} awfulness of a combat hospital seen emphatically through the prism of TV drama." [...] In concluding his review Doyle said, [...] "In the matter of Afghanistan and military life there, if you want a gruelling experience, <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> Combat Hospital is the entertaining version." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we explore {{patterns}} of television news use, using data from a national survey on Media Use in the Netherlands conducted in 1994 (n = 969). Results indicate that people {{are much more likely}} to prefer watching television news selectively and attentively than <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> while simultaneously engaging in other activities. Moreover, the chances of this preference for <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> selectively and attentively are even greater for men, older people, and people endorsing well-informed citizen 9 s values. They are somewhat smaller for women, younger people, and people without well-informed citizen's values. No evidence of interaction among these determinants was found. Contrary to our expectations, education, occupation, and having children do not seem to influence self-reported patterns of television news use. A possible explanation for the difference between men and women, is the subjective definition of 'home 9 as a sphere of leisure for men and a sphere of labor for women, which traditional role-expectancies may still engender. A possible explanation for the inclination of older people and people with well-informed citizens values to prefer <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> selectively and attentively, may be found in a relatively strong feeling that <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> is important...|$|R

2500|$|From [...] to , Fisher Broadcasting's ABC {{affiliates}} in Seattle (KOMO-TV) and Portland (KATU) aired MNF {{games on}} a one-hour tape delay starting at 7:00p.m. Pacific Time (games normally {{started in the}} Pacific Time Zone at 6:00p.m., corresponding to 9:00 Eastern) {{in order to accommodate}} local newscasts (unless the Seattle Seahawks were playing, in which case the game would be shown live). The practice, long opposed by viewers and ABC, ended in [...] KOMO then tried to accommodate having to air its local newscasts earlier than its local station competitors by marketing it as KOMO 4 News Primetime, touting {{it as a way to}} <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> at a more convenient time than during evening rush hour. Additionally, this practice was done in Hawaii, where Honolulu ABC affiliate KITV delayed the game until 6:00p.m. Hawaii-Aleutian Time, corresponding to 11:00p.m. or midnight Eastern during daylight saving time on the mainland. Thus, the game, which was broadcast live on local radio starting at 3:00 or 4:00p.m., was almost over before it aired on television. In the case of Guam, KTGM, the ABC affiliate in that U.S. territory, aired MNF live on Tuesdays at 11:00a.m., as Guam is a day ahead of the United States due to being located on the other side of International Date Line.|$|E
