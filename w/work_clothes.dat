5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic <b>work</b> <b>clothes,</b> a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E

Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his <b>work</b> <b>clothes.</b>|$|E

I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry.

25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of <b>work</b> <b>clothes</b> (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
25|$|If the {{requirements}} were not met they were punished. Punishments by the Muchachos were very severe and brutal. Common punishments including flogging, hanging, and {{being put into}} a cepo. When the workers were put into a cepo they were chained in pain inflicting positions and left without food and water for an extensive amount of time. More extreme punishments included the shooting of workers if they tried to escape or they became too ill to work. The pay for their hard labor was minimal. They were put on what was called a debt-penoage where they had {{to work for a}} long period of time in order to gain funds to pay back debt they owned to the Caucheros for supplies that were given to them for their daily tasks such as tools to <b>work,</b> <b>clothes,</b> and food. It most commonly lead them to work their whole life for the rubber barons due to the fact that very little money was compensated for their labor. They usually received a small item that they were able to keep such as a hammock, the rest was given straight to the employer. Government intervention was minimal to none because of bribery that lead local officials to overlook what was occurring and the fear of being attacked by the Indians. The end of the Rubber Boom was marked in 1920 when the prices of rubber diminished. The enslavement of the Indigenous people seized in association with this.|$|E
