I {{know there are}} a lot of disappointed fans. They don't really understand what goes on behind the doors. They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. But what happens at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "It’s just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E

Her {{possession}} of an unregistered vagina also equips her {{to work as a}} prostitute and spread venereal diseases. Let's hope Kletter is as responsible with her equipment as most gun owners are with theirs." ...|$|E

I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." [...] She added, [...] "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays {{make a lot of money}} and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us." ...|$|E

50|$|The Four Corners {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{co-operative}} teaching and learning strategies.

In addition, this text <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the political dispute imposed by the area of biomedical sciences that apparently seems to be little concerned with ethical issues per se and seeks, first and foremost, to maintain its power...|$|R
5000|$|Prometheus <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} {{economics}} {{could be a}} very weak reason for making decisions, while [...] "Sociology, anthropology, and other sciences have quantitative and qualitative contributions to make in the policy process.

50|$|The {{symbolism}} of the donkey may also refer to the Eastern tradition {{that it is an}} animal of peace, versus the horse, which is an animal of war. Therefore, a king came riding upon a horse when he was bent on war and rode upon a donkey when he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that he was coming in peace. Therefore, Jesus' entry to Jerusalem symbolized his entry as the Prince of Peace, not as a warmongering king.|$|R

It's slow and deep until you reach the fall, where it's merely held up by the ridge of rock the rapid runs across. Well, we'll call the change of level twelve to sixteen feet, and, as Gordon has suggested, a big strip of natural prairie is apt to make a {{particularly}} desirable property, once you run {{the water out of}} it.

What I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out to you is, though, if you'll allow me, that the necklace I had on the table before me at Stephano's when Mr. Cullen suddenly popped round the screen--the necklace you are now looking at, sir--is of imitation pearls, valued at about ten pounds. I bought it in the Burlington Arcade; it belongs to my daughter, and I was simply examining the clasp, which is scarcely safe." ...|$|E
