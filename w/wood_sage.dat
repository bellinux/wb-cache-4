5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and <b>wood</b> <b>sage</b> (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the area}} {{is a mixture of}} moorland and meadows. The moorland is {{dominated}} by <b>wood</b> <b>sage,</b> heather and bilberry, while the meadows support a range of wild flowers including mountain pansy, tormentil and harebell. At lower elevations, gorse, bramble and hawthorn appear. The broadleaved Teggsnose Wood covers {{the southern part of the}} hill, with oak, beech, hornbeam, holly and mountain ash.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile the <b>Sage</b> <b>Wood</b> and Pine Barren stage coach, profoundly oblivious--after {{the manner}} of all human invention--of {{everything}} but its regular function, toiled dustily out of the higher plain and began the grateful descent of a wooded canyon, which was, in fact, the culminating point of the depression, just described, along which the shadowy procession was slowly advancing, hardly a mile in the rear and flank of the vehicle. Miss Julia Cantire, who had faced the dust volleys of the plain unflinchingly, as became a soldier's daughter, here stood upright and shook herself--her pretty head and figure emerging like a goddess from the enveloping silver cloud. At least Mr. Boyle, relegated to the back seat, thought so--although her conversation and attentions had been chiefly directed to the driver and mail agent. Once, when he had light-heartedly addressed a remark to her, it had been received with a distinct but unpromising politeness that had made him desist from further attempts, yet without abatement of his cheerfulness, or resentment of the evident amusement his two male companions {{got out of his}} [...] "snub." [...] Indeed, it is to be feared that Miss Julia had certain prejudices of position, and may have thought that a [...] "drummer"--or commercial traveler--was no more fitting company for the daughter of a major than an ordinary peddler. But it was more probable that Mr. Boyle's reputation as a humorist--a teller of funny stories and a boon companion of men--was inconsistent with the feminine ideal of high and exalted manhood. The man who [...] "sets the table in a roar" [...] is apt to be secretly detested by the sex, {{to say nothing of the}} other obvious reasons why Juliets do not like Mercutios! ...|$|R
