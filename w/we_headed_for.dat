60|$|I couldn't see the driver, {{and across}} my mind it rushed That that Commissariat {{elephant}} had suddenly gone musth. I didn't care to meet him, and I couldn't well get down, So I let the Waler have it, and <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the town.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is neither}} more nor less than blind chance," [...] I said in reply to my companion's words. [...] "Because <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the ship-yard they {{supposed}} {{we had a}} boat nearby, and because our people were gathering at Cambridge they would naturally say it was our purpose to go there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will!" [...] said Sam confidently. [...] "How about North Wales? I've {{heard people}} speak well of North Wales. Shall <b>we</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> North Wales?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I 'm gettin' plumb dried out," [...] Billy announced, mopping {{the sweat}} from his sunburned forehead. [...] "What d'ye say <b>we</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> the coast?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Rabbi Rosen cited Deuteronomy 30:19: [...] "Choose life {{in order}} {{that you and your}} {{children}} shall live." [...] He said, [...] "today, climate change is {{a matter of life and}} death. Because of this, everything else becomes secondary—it's like rearranging the deck chairs on the ship Titanic as <b>we</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> the iceberg." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{so it was}} <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> {{the nearest}} point, taking all the chances, and that night's work caused {{me to believe that}} he who goes boldly about a matter, is in no more danger than the timorous one who strives to make certain the way be clear before he sets out.|$|E
60|$|Well, after Moselikatse's Zulus {{were finally}} {{defeated}} the question arose {{whether we should}} proceed to Zoutpansberg and settle there, or follow our brethren who in large numbers had already crossed the Quathlamba Mountains into Natal {{under the leadership of}} Retief. In the end we decided for Natal because it was nearer the sea, for in those days we never dreamed that the treacherous British Government would steal that land also; so trekking slowly, <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Van Reenen's Pass, our party then numbering thirty waggons and about sixty white people.|$|E
6000|$|Hartman and I {{agreed that}} it was useless to report {{ourselves}} to the local chiefs of the secret service. Our failure so to report would be excused, we knew, in the light of subsequent events. So <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the great labor-ghetto on the South Side in the hope of getting in contact with some of the comrades. Too late! We knew it. But we could not stand still and do nothing in those ghastly, silent streets. Where was Ernest? I was wondering. What was happening in the cities of the labor castes and Mercenaries? In the fortresses? ...|$|E
40|$|Are <b>we</b> <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> {{a softer}} Brexit after the Conservatives’ electoral setback? Piers Ludlow doubts it. There {{is little to}} suggest voters were warning Theresa May off a hard Brexit. The Cabinet {{reshuffle}} is unlikely to tip the balance, and even if she returns from Brussels with a softer deal {{it is far from}} clear that Labour would back it...|$|R
6000|$|With hasty {{assurance}} he said: [...] "Sit tight! See. <b>We</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> that tall oak, up the slope, {{then through}} the clearing, keeping to the right. You'll {{be able to}} see the oak as soon as you get the firelight out of your eyes. Remember I used to hunt every fall, as a kid, and come back through the dark. Don't worry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She {{promised that}} my boy, every morning, should be {{carried to the}} hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! <b>we</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> Nantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy's face from the window! the boy's hand on the hill!" ...|$|R
60|$|It was Saturday, and Charley had need to hurry. <b>We</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the {{shipyard}} blacksmith shop, where, under Charley's directions, a most generously curved book of heavy steel was made. Back we hastened to the Mary Rebecca. Aft {{of the great}} centre-board case, through what was properly her keel, a hole was bored. The end of the hook was inserted from the outside, and Charley, on the inside, screwed the nut on tightly. As it stood complete, the hook projected over a foot beneath {{the bottom of the}} schooner. Its curve was something like the curve of a sickle, but deeper.|$|E
60|$|Now {{it is no}} snap {{to strike}} a strange town, broke, at midnight, in cold weather, and {{find a place to}} sleep. The Swede hadn't a penny. My total assets {{consisted}} of two dimes and a nickel. From some of the town boys we learned that beer was five cents, and that the saloons kept open all night. There was our meat. Two glasses of beer would cost ten cents, there would be a stove and chairs, and we could sleep it out till morning. <b>We</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the lights of a saloon, walking briskly, the snow crunching under our feet, a chill little wind blowing through us.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> {{the second}} school. My thrilling {{expectancy}} was tinged and spoiled with doubt. I skipped my bait {{in imitation of}} a flying-fish leaping and splashing along. We reached {{the outer edge of}} the school. Slowly the little boils smoothed out. Slowly the big fins sank. So did my heart. We passed the school. They all sank. And then when Captain Dan swore and I gave up there came a great splash back of my bait. I yelled and my comrades echoed me. The tuna missed. I skipped the bait. A sousing splash--and another tuna had my bait. My line sagged. I jerked hard. But too late! The tuna threw the hook before it got a hold.|$|E
6000|$|... "Any other way?" [...] queried Young Dick. [...] "What's {{the matter}} with south? <b>We</b> can <b>head</b> <b>for</b> Los Angeles, an' Arizona, an' New Mexico--oh, an' Texas." ...|$|R
5000|$|It's 13:15. All {{personnel}} from section six, seven, and eight {{have moved to}} section nine, there are 23 people here. We feel bad, weakened by carbon dioxide ...

All {{personnel from}} sections six, seven, and eight have moved to section nine. We have made the decision because {{none of us can}} escape.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> shook our <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> {{neither of}} us could {{remember}} having done so.|$|R
6000|$|... "We made {{tracks for}} our hosses an' packs, an' was hittin' the San Felipe road when we run right plumb into the young man. Well, {{he said his}} name was Gale--Dick Gale. The girl was with him safe an' well; but her sweetheart, the soldier, bein' away without leave, {{had to go back}} sudden. There shore was some trouble, for Jim an' me heard shootin'. Gale said he had no money, no friends, was a {{stranger}} in a desert country; an' he was distracted to know how to help the girl. So me an' Jim started off with them for San Felipe, got switched, and' then <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Rio Forlorn." ...|$|E
60|$|So this, for me, very dull journey continued, till at length, {{after being}} held {{up for a}} couple of days by a flooded river where there was nothing to do but sit and smoke, as Nombe {{requested}} me not to make a noise by shooting at the big game that abounded, we began to emerge from the bush-veld on to the lovely uplands in the neighbourhood of Nongoma. Leaving these on our right <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> a place called Ceza, a natural stronghold consisting of a flat plain on the top of a mountain, which plain is surrounded by bush. It is at the foot of this stronghold that the Black Kloof lies, being one of the ravines that run up into the mountain.|$|E
60|$|The {{east side}} of the gulf is fringed with islands, some solitary, others in groups. On the blue {{background}} of the high coast they seem to float on silvery patches of calm water, arid and gray, or dark green and rounded like clumps of evergreen bushes, with the larger ones, a mile or two long, showing the outlines of ridges, ribs of gray rock under the dark mantle of matted leafage. Unknown to trade, to travel, almost to geography, the manner of life they harbor is an unsolved secret. There must be villages--settlements of fishermen at least--on the largest of them, and some communication with the world is probably kept up by native craft. But all that forenoon, as <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> them, fanned along by the faintest of breezes, I saw no sign of man or canoe in the field of the telescope I kept on pointing at the scattered group.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the day of}} the {{election}} three vice-presidents and candidates complained of vote rigging. Bemba, Ruberwa and Z'Ahidi said [...] "Perhaps <b>we</b> are <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> a masquerade or a parody of elections".|$|R
2500|$|On 14 July, {{following}} Israeli bombing {{raids on}} Lebanon which result in killing 60 civilians [...] Nasrallah said, addressing Israel: [...] "You wanted an open war, and <b>we</b> are <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> an open war. We {{are ready for}} it." ...|$|R
60|$|Now that Mr. Ranson {{had found}} us, {{the course of}} the steam yacht was changed, so that <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> {{directly}} <b>for</b> Boston. Phil and I were assigned a cosy stateroom, and it is perhaps useless to state that both of us slept soundly.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{let down}} my rod and dove {{for the short}} rope to lasso the {{sweeping}} tail. Fortunately he kept quiet a moment in which I got the loop fast. It was then Xiphius gladius really woke up. He began a tremendous beating with his tail. Both gaff ropes began to loosen, and the rope on his tail flew out of my hands. Dan got it in time. But it was slipping. He yelled {{for me to make}} a hitch somewhere. I was pulled flat in the cockpit, but scrambled up, out on the stern, and held on to that rope grimly while I tried to fasten it. Just almost impossible! The water was deluging us. The swordfish banged the boat with sodden, heavy blows. But I got the rope fast. Then I went to Dan's assistance. The two of us pulled that tremendous tail up {{out of the water and}} made fast the rope. Then we knew we had him. But he surged and strained and lashed for a long while. And side blows of his sword scarred the boat. At last he sagged down quiet, and <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Avalon. Once more in smooth water, we loaded him astern. I found the hook just in the corner of his mouth, which fact accounted for the long battle.|$|E
6000|$|... “I tell you, lad, {{it seemed}} to me that our chances were slight indeed, for nearly half our men and two of the {{officers}} were away in prizes, and, including officers and boys, we had but fifty-four men on board, so it was probable that the enemy had five or six times that number, while he had thirty-four guns to our fourteen miserable little pieces. I thought it certain we should be blown out of the water, and I fancy everyone else thought the same. However, we held on straight towards her. She fired a gun and hoisted Spanish colours. At that time we were almost abreast of her, and Cochrane, who had the American colours ready, ordered them to be run up. This gave us time to get on to the other tack, and hold on till a little out of her direct line of fire. Then we at once pulled down the stars and stripes and hoisted the British ensign. The Spaniard fired a broadside, to which we made no reply. Our guns were trebly shotted, but Cochrane had given orders that not a shot was to be fired until we were alongside the Spaniard, as our fire would do no damage whatever to the ship. As <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> her they fired another broadside, but, like the first, this did us no harm, and rounding up under her stern Cochrane ran us alongside.|$|E
5000|$|The International Workers of the World [...] was {{organizing}} sawmill {{workers and}} every non-union mill was (a) target. A.L. Emerson was the organizer making the sawmill rounds and speaking {{on this particular}} Sunday.Rogers picks up the story as an eyewitness: [...] "We had been to Merryville, Singer, Newlin and Carson and were headed for Bon Ami. Before we could get there someone came up and warned that Bon Ami was filled with gunmen and that we'd certainly be killed if we went there."There was 15 wagon-loads of us.

It was about 3:30 in the afternoon when we pulled up before the Grabow office and the shooting started right off."Three men were killed in my wagon. [...] "Kate" [...] Hall went down first, I guess they figured he was Emerson, what with him having Emerson's hat and coat on. Then a fellow named Martin was shot and another whose name I don't recall right off went down with him." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{remained}} under arms, and in momentary {{expectation of}} being {{engaged in a}} life or death struggle, until near sunset, when General Winder arrived, and without loss of time <b>we</b> were <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Washington at a sharp pace, thus being forced to march over the same ground three times without having seen the enemy once.|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins]CAMPBELL ARMY AIR FIELDCAMP CAMPBELL, KENTUCKY January 9, 1944 Sunday, 9 : 20 PM. Dear Friends of Bryant: It was a {{pleasure}} indeed {{to hear from you}} again. I have been traveling about the country quite a bit, seeing most of our nation through a train window. At the present time, I am stationed here at the Campbell Army Air Base in Kentucky. July and August were spent going through a desert manuever [sic] under the extremely warm sun of Arizona. La Guna, Arizona to be more definite. We were actually fighting three enemies there, the Red Army, the rattlesnakes and the scorpions. Temperatures reached as high as 154 degrees with the usual temperature varying between 135 - 145 °. It was wonderful experience for hardships to come. From Arizona <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> North Carolina. After but three weeks there, {{we were on our way}} again. We have been manuevering [sic] here for two months now and we are thoroughly accustomed to all kind of conditions. The boys are anxious to make the big move across the water. We will have to wait for Uncle Sam 2 ̆ 7 s orders however. I have kept in contact with several of the friends made at Bryant. All are doing very well and all of them, sometime or another, mentioned the Bryant Service Club. We want you to know that we deeply appreciate your efforts and we all hope to visit our grand school again someday. To all you students at Bryant, I want to say, Thanks a million for the fine spirit shown and keep up the good work, all of you. Sincerely,Cpl Frank Addario. [Transcription ends...|$|E

40|$|There {{were times}} during the drought when I caught myself trading a couple of extra minutes in the shower against the water tank out the window. There was no {{material}} connection – the tank was not connected to the shower – {{but there was a}} subconscious exchange of guilt with smugness. So I was not surprised when, after substantial initial savings, the water bill started to creep up again.   After a decade of drought and a couple of wet years, urban Australians are emerging from the strictures of a diet into a maintenance regime. Now as we shower it is often raining out the window, so it {{is a good time to}} reflect on whether we have shifted our cultures of urban water into a more sustainable mode of operation. Can we maintain our portion control, or are <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> a junk food blowout? Is the controversial toilet etiquette ‘if it’s yellow let it mellow’ just an affectation of affluent urbanites who have never had to live with unhygienic sanitary conditions? And even if not, should it be maintained in wetter times? What is the role and responsibility of the household in driving or maintaining change, given an underlying infrastructure developed around what Zoë Sofoulis has dubbed ‘Big Water’ – the fantasy of endless supply? To what extent can behavioural and technical changes translate into real and sustained water savings, given the infrastructure of supply? A body of cultural research on urban water practices allows us to step back and examine the extent to which we have shifted under the power of drought. The drought threw light on and de-routinised many of our water practices, but have they regrouped into more sustainable long-term configurations? Image: solidether / flick...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{instead of}} {{continuing}} to aim <b>for</b> Aylesbury, <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> by cross-roads <b>for</b> some point to the northward of it, whither I might assist Rowley with the baggage, and where I might leave him to await my return in the post-chaise.|$|R
40|$|We ask three {{research}} questions: 1) Did {{government intervention}} {{contribute to the}} housing bubble of 2008 ? 2) Are the same recovery policies conducted today, {{on the way out}} of the housing bubble? 3) Are <b>we</b> <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> a new wave of financial crises? What kind and how? With theoretical perspective of Minsky and the Austrian school of economics we assess the data necessary to explain the course of events and answer our questions in a comparative study of USA, the euro area, and Norway. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find evidence that the government did contribute to the housing bubble through both fiscal and monetary policies. Not only are the same policies conducted today, but also to a much larger degree. The answers of the first two questions lay the foundation for the third, where we conclude; yes, <b>we</b> are <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> a new wave of financial crises. In USA we find potential for stock market crisis through a credit crunch. For the euro area we find general potential for malinvestments, and possibility of both credit- and real resource crunch. And, in Norway we find potential for a housing- and stock market crisis through a credit crunch – or possibly a real resource crunch through housing construction. We do see possibility of rescue with increased saving. On the side we find Minsky’s theories well fit to explain the course of events and the Austrian school valuable in explaining underlying factors...|$|R
40|$|Physical China, demographically and environmentally, {{would be}} a {{significant}} stakeholder in 21 st century global management. Cultural China, which {{would be a}} civilisation no longer pretending to be a state (Communist or otherwise), would represent a distinctive value system based on the primacy of relationships, be they in politics, business or any other area of human endeavour. As <b>we</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> a more sinicised global system, how will Chinese-style international and regional relationships interact with Western constructs of international life? Through strategic-cultural analysis, this article concludes that the Chinese impact on world affairs will result in a system of global politics with Chinese characteristics.
