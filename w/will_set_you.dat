Describing this period of his life, Lynch said [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing <b>will</b> <b>set</b> <b>you</b> back". In Olson's David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, the author posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the [...] Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E
500|$|The Edict of Tolerance in 1787 gave Protestants {{legal status}} and a {{congregation}} was formed under the pastorship of Paul-Henri Marron, {{who had been}} serving as the chaplain at the Dutch embassy. [...] The congregation gained permission to worship openly in 1789 during the revolution and met {{in a variety of}} places including a wine shop before gaining permission to rent Saint-Louis-du-Louve, the first building dedicated to Protestant worship in the history of Paris. [...] For the dedication of the new church, or temple as French Protestants referred to their buildings, Pastor Marron preached from the text, [...] "Soyez joyeux dans l’espérance, patients dans l’affliction, persévérants dans la prière," [...] (be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer (Romans 12:12)). [...] When the mayor, Jean Bailly, attended in person on 13 October 1791 Marron chose the passage, [...] "Vous connaissez la vérité et la vérité vous rendra libres," [...] (you will know the truth, and the truth <b>will</b> <b>set</b> <b>you</b> free (John 8:32)).|$|E

Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing <b>will</b> <b>set</b> <b>you</b> back". Film critic Greg Olson, in his book David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E

This text, {{though it}} be now one of the {{brightest}} stars that shineth in the Bible, because there is in it, as full, if not the fullest offer of grace that can be imagined, to the sons of men; yet, to them that shall perish from under this word, even this text will be to such one of the hottest coals in hell.

The Christian character of the university is well illustrated by its history as a school founded by American Protestant missionaries and by its school motto from the Bible, [...] "The truth <b>will</b> <b>set</b> <b>you</b> free" [...] (John 8:32).
