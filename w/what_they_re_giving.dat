Among the animals used for traction and tillage, donkeys are the most undervalued power source {{in many parts of}} the world. Their price is way below <b>what</b> <b>they</b> yield. Perhaps this straightforward manual in the Agrodok series, devoted to donkeys work, will change that. Apart from the chapters on care, harnessing, hitching and equipment for tillage and traction, one chapter is dedicated to training donkeys and includes a list of commands. Not so stubborn after all? The manual provides the answer: donkeys refuse to do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>re</b> told only if the job is really impossible. The sweetest bit of advice is that donkeys suffer when alone and will perform better in company of other donkeys or animals.

40|$|Interest {{has been}} {{expressed}} {{in having a}} review {{of some of the}} research on the Relationship Enhancement (RE) model that has been conducted over the years. In this brief review, I will focus on three studies that I think are particularly illuminating because of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> demonstrate regarding <b>RE’s</b> long-term effectiveness. The first two studies involve mother-daughter dyads, while the third study involves couples. In the first study (Guerney, Coufal, & Vogelsong, 1981), mother and daughter pairs were assigned to a no-treatment group, a structured RE therapy treatment group, or a “Traditional Treatment ” (TT) group involving unstructured open communication about roles, feelings and desired behaviors. Participants in the no-treatment group showed virtually no improvement while the TT group participants showed improvement only in the general quality of their relationships. By contrast, participants in the structured RE therapy group showed significant gains in all areas measured: empathy, expressive skill, general communication patterns, and the general quality of their relationships. This study lends some indirect support to the supposition that the structured nature of the RE skills-training model is one factor contributing to its outcome effectiveness. In a follow-up to the previous study (Guerney, Vogelsong & Coufal, 1983), the researcher...|$|R
40|$|Multifragmentation is {{observed}} in many reaction types: light ion induced reactions at large incident energies (in the GeV region), central heavy ion collisions from 30 to 100 MeV/u, and peripheral heavy ion collisions between 30 and 1000 MeV/u or above. When nucleus-nucleus collisions are considered, another entrance channel parameter is the corresponding mass asymmetry. The rst question which is {{addressed in this}} contribution is: do we observe similar reactions in each case? Multifragmentation {{may be related to}} a phase transition of nuclear matter. Some others features indicate that dynamical features are dominant. It is a priori possible that the underlying mechanisms are dierent in proton and nucleus induced reactions, in central and in peripheral collisions, at limited and at large bombarding energies. In order to see to <b>what</b> extent <b>they</b> can <b>re</b> ect similar behaviour, it is useful to compare the results of various reactions. The observables can be the fragment multiplicity, the mass distributions or the kinematical properties. In this contribution, we are looking for such general features. We will limit the discussion to the observations themselves, rather than the interpretation, which is the subject of numerous entries in this volume. The experimental results indicate that multifragmentation exhibit...|$|R
