The park became a peaceful trading market, but by 2287 the Nuka-World ruins have been overrun by an alliance of raider gangs <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as a personal fortress. Unlike the raiders featured in the base game, the raiders of Nuka-World are much more disciplined and organised, with each gang following a different ideology.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpreter}} has an object-oriented architecture. All of {{the elements}} of the Perl language—scalars, arrays, hashes, coderefs, file handles—are represented in the interpreter by C structs. Operations on these structs are defined by a large collection of macros, typedefs, and functions; these constitute the Perl C API. The Perl API can be bewildering to the uninitiated, but its entry points follow a consistent naming scheme, which provides guidance to those <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E

25|$|When {{tying the}} half-knots, a right-over-left half-knot {{followed}} by a left-over-right half-knot (or vice versa) forms a square or reef knot, a fairly effective knot {{for the purpose of}} tying shoelaces. However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half-knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half-knots) forms the infamous granny knot, which is much less secure. Most people <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> will find themselves regularly retying their shoelaces.|$|E
25|$|Anne Hvide's House (Anne Hvides Gård), a two-storey, half-timbered building, {{is one of}} Svendborg's oldest houses. Anne Hvide, a {{widow of}} noble descent, had it built in 1560.

25|$|The Ancholme Internal Drainage Board {{maintains}} twelve pumping stations on {{the banks}} of the river, which pump water from the surrounding low-lying land to prevent flooding.

In order to maintain this volume of abstraction during the summer months, and other dry periods, water is transferred from Barlings Eau, near the River Witham, by the Trent Witham Ancholme transfer scheme, commissioned in 1974.|$|E

The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, a far {{different}} version was produced, titled The Omega Man. It starred Charlton Heston (as Robert Neville) and Anthony Zerbe. Matheson had no influence on the screenplay for this film, and although the premise remains, it deviates from the novel in several ways, removing the infected people's vampiric characteristics, except their sensitivity to light. In this version, the infected are portrayed as nocturnal, black-robed, albino mutants, known as The Family. Though intelligent, they eschew modern technology, believing it (and those <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it,</b> such as Neville) to be evil {{and the cause of}} humanity's downfall.|$|E

It {{is estimated that}} there are about 64 million native Italian speakers while {{the total number of}} Italian speakers, including those <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as a second language, is about 85 million. Italy has numerous regional dialects; however, the establishment of a national education system has led to a decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country during the 20th century. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television (the state broadcaster RAI helped set a standard Italian).|$|E

25|$|While the {{production}} of 40 by 60cm paper remains economically important, the amate production of the San Pablito has since diversified. New products include envelopes, bookmarks, cutout figures, and booklets, as well as sheets {{in a variety of}} colors, textures and sizes up to 1.20 by 2.40 meters. There are also varieties decorated with dried flowers and leaves. In addition to traditional Nahua customers, amate paper is now sold to industries <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to produce other end products such as lampshades, furniture covers, wallpaper and parquet flooring. The success of amate paper commercialization has caused the population here to forego most other economic activities such as agriculture and even other handcrafts such as pottery and weaving.|$|E
25|$|The Rawk {{is a large}} boulder {{donated by}} members of Alpha Phi Omega in 1973 and painted nearly every day by {{students}}, <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as a giant message board. Unofficial rules govern {{the use of the}} Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} {{there is no}} clear {{majority}} in either element or quality to give a clear signature. In these cases the ruling planet of the sun is noted for its position in the chart (alternatively, the ascendant can be added at this stage if it has not already been included). Whatever sign the ruling planet occupies is then added to the totals for element and quality. So for example, if the Sun is in Taurus, its ruling planet Venus is noted for its position by sign. If Venus is in, say, Pisces, then an additional 'casting vote' is given to the element water and quality mutable. This is usually enough to provide a signature. A 'casting vote' is given in this way on account of the extra importance of the Sun in the natal chart. The signature sign is regarded by those astrologers <b>who</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as frequently having an over-riding influence in the natal chart, irrespective of what sign the sun or ascendant occupies.|$|E
