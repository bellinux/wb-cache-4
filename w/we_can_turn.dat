The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E

2500|$|The idea of handle {{trading is}} to create a {{cancelling}} pair of (k+1)- and (k+2)-handles so that a given k-handle cancels with the (k+1)-handle leaving behind the (k+2)-handle.

2500|$|Pedagogical content {{knowledge}} {{is understood as}} the “blending of content and pedagogy” that guides the organization, representation and adaptation of the material for all learners through instruction. This concept goes beyond the consideration of the {{content knowledge}} as isolated from the pedagogical knowledge teachers must possess to effectively cater {{to the needs of}} their students. In order to illustrate how pedagogical content knowledge operates in reference to a specific knowledge domain, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> to the field of second language teaching. In this field, pedagogical content knowledge can be considered a “developmental construct” [...] initiated in pre-service teacher education programs and continued through in-service classroom experiences or “knowledge in action”. From this perspective, it is useful to look at the various components. Pedagogical knowledge refers to the different instructional approaches and techniques used to teach languages as well as the consideration of how the linguistic knowledge progresses and grows in complexity along the continuum of a curriculum (i.e., Schulman’s lateral curricular knowledge). This pedagogical knowledge also involves a growing understanding of content choice and pedagogy that views language learning as communication, performance in tasks, student-centered instruction, attention to accuracy and message. On the other hand, if we were to characterize the content knowledge in language teaching, we would be talking about the target language. What it entails for the second language teacher is not only the mastery of the target language but also “discipline-derived understandings from applied linguistics, SLA, psychology and curriculum development, among other areas, in a deeper examination of [...] subject matter -language- as it becomes classroom content”. However, if we are to enhance the definition of the pedagogical content knowledge in second language teaching, we need to include aspects related to language knowledge for teaching by following Schulman’s dimension of “subject matter knowledge for teaching”. These aspects include language teachers’ use of effective ways to represent the various types of knowledge involved in learning a language [...] that include {{but are not limited to}} syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. Besides it will require teachers to have a wide understanding of their language learners’ characteristics to be able to identify and explore the conceptions and misconceptions and, more importantly, “potential misunderstandings of [...] subject area” [...] these learners bring and/or develop in the learning situation. It also includes ways to help learners overcome these difficulties. For instance, Spanish speakers tend to omit subjects while learning a language with weak nominal features such as English, due to the fact that Spanish is predominantly a null subject language. Therefore, this may turn into a source of overgeneralization while these learners learn the target language. [...] The two main aspects of pedagogical content knowledge presented here correspond to the two domains defined by Ball, Thames and Phelps [...] as knowledge of content and teaching as well as knowledge of content and students respectively. The consideration of all these components constitutes the pedagogical content knowledge language teachers need to possess to become effective practitioners.|$|E
