It was before all of his reputation came to be, that everybody knows him for now." [...] Valentino added, [...] "He was a cheerleader. He could play everything if we needed him to. He was great.

500|$|After Tottenham's {{victory over}} Chelsea in January 2015, blogger Chris Miller wrote, [...] "Nobody thought he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> {{who was going}} to give that {{performance}} against Chelsea". In February 2015, BBC Sport wrote that Kane was best as a lone striker, with his [...] "hold-up play and close control" [...] making him apt in other positions as well. Also that month, Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy said that the England team should be built around Kane, stating, [...] "I'm struggling to see a weakness in the lad's game".|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, Flaubert's project Root! {{announced}} {{they would be}} playing their [...] "Last Ever Show" [...] on 20 August 2010. Although the press release concluded with [...] "... is there a new project on the way? All will be revealed soon. Stay tuned." [...] Following this, a Facebook page was sent out to friends of DC Root which promoted a new band named 'The DC3'; itself a reference to 'DC Root' and his real name of Damian Cowell. The band's first single was released on 26 November 2010 titled [...] "I <b>Was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Guy</b> in TISM." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting {{the lead}} role of Barris was a long, {{difficult}} process. [...] "After two months of screen tests and everything I still wasn't able to get Sam Rockwell," [...] Clooney reflected. Rockwell had always been Clooney's first choice ever since they worked together on Welcome to Collinwood (2002). Both Clooney and Barris also believed Rockwell shared an uncanny resemblance to Barris. [...] "I didn't want someone too famous to play the role," [...] the director reasoned. [...] "In my opinion, you cannot have famous people playing famous people. It doesn't work. Sam <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> for the part, ready to break and hadn't yet." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{covered this}} scene with {{another one of}} the key {{changing}} into the fat black guy, and the ignition slot turning into Maybellene. I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man's face with his hand covering his eyes. You can {{get a sense of how}} many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since I worked on it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the fourth}} {{series of the}} late night spinoff show Hollyoaks Later, Mercedes' past was {{explored}} when she goes to Ibiza to celebrate her hen night. While there she was reunited with Johnny (Chris Coghill), her first love. Metcalfe said this caused a [...] "real mix of emotions for Mercedes". She went on to elaborate {{that there was a}} lot her character wanted to say to Johnny but [...] "at the same time she doesn't see the point. There's a lot of anger there. But there's also a lot of excitement for Mercedes as she sees him again, because he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who won her heart for the first time. The storyline also explains why Mercedes is the way she is now". Mercedes and Johnny kissed, which Metcalfe said was them just [...] "getting lost in the moment" [...] and was partly due to Mercedes having doubts about Riley's fidelity. She added that Mercedes and Johnny spend time [...] "just talking and reliving the old times, especially how he won her over in the past".|$|E

50|$|Although save {{points are}} {{typically}} seen as boons, some games have traps which use this tendency {{to fool the}} player.

In I Wanna <b>Be</b> <b>The</b> <b>Guy,</b> one save point is actually an enemy in disguise.|$|R
500|$|The brawling {{continued}} in 1990. During an August 9 game at Shea, Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr. When Gooden came to bat {{in the fifth}} inning, Phillies pitcher Pat Combs hit Gooden in the knee with a fastball. Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game. Eight players were later fined, including the Mets' Tim Teufel, who said, [...] "It was money well spent. Sometimes you just have to defend yourself and your teammates." ...|$|E
500|$|Sebastian {{reflected}} on his song's popularity, [...] "I guess its success {{is due to}} it being a well-written pop ballad, coupled {{with the fact that}} it's perfectly suited to my voice, and also my back-story... It doesn't take a genius to realise that the show was mostly responsible for the songs enormity but still, I'm glad I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> standing there at the end singing it". In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something of the joy of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards to people like Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, {{has much to do with}} Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of}} all this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

500|$|Simon {{has been}} {{credited}} with [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Former Simpsons director Brad Bird has described him as [...] "the unsung hero" [...] of the show, while Vitti has stated to [...] "leave out Sam Simon" [...] is to tell [...] "the managed version" [...] of The Simpsons history, because [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> we wrote for." [...] Writer Ken Levine called Simon [...] "the real creative force behind The Simpsons...The tone, the storytelling, the level of humor – that was all developed on Sam's watch." [...] Levine says that Simon [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that his [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon crafted {{much of the world}} of Springfield and designed the models for many of the show's recurring characters, including Mr. Burns, Dr. Hibbert, Chief Wiggum and Eddie and Lou, as well as many of the one-time and guest star roles, such as Bleeding Gums Murphy. One of his contributions to the show's character development was his proposal that Waylon Smithers should be gay, but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it; Smithers' sexuality became one of the show's longest-running gags. [...] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you just listen to the sound track, it works." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because Crowe {{was a fan}} of the 1970s {{hard rock}} bands that the older writers disliked, he landed a lot of major interviews. He wrote {{predominantly}} about Yes and the band members, and also about Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Eagles, King Crimson, Linda Ronstadt, Rory Gallagher, Todd Rundgren, and more. In an interview with Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle, Fong-Torres remarked, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> we sent out after some difficult customers. He covered the bands that hated Rolling Stone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording for At the Drive-In’s {{third and}} then-final {{full-length}} album Relationship of Command began on January 17, 2000.

[...] Relationship of Command was recorded over a seven-week period and featured Iggy Pop with minor parts {{on a couple of}} the album’s songs. It was released September 12, 2000 to critical acclaim, and catapulted At the Drive-In into the mainstream musical spotlight.|$|E
2500|$|Performing in Westerns was {{a return}} {{to what he had}} done earlier in his career, and McCrea enjoyed the genre. [...] In a 1978 interview, he said: I liked doing comedies, but as I got older I was better suited to do Westerns. Because I think it becomes un{{attractive}} for an older fellow trying to look young, falling in love with attractive girls in those kinds of situations...Anyway, I always felt so much more comfortable in the Western.

500|$|Hamming {{initially}} {{wanted to}} study engineering, but money <b>was</b> scarce during <b>the</b> Great Depression, and the only scholarship offer he received came from the University of Chicago, which had no engineering school. Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937. He later considered this a fortunate turn of events. [...] "As an engineer," [...] he said, [...] "I would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> going down manholes instead of having the excitement of frontier research work." ...|$|R
2500|$|While Hanks' family {{religious}} {{history was}} Catholic and Mormon, he has characterized himself {{as being a}} [...] "Bible-toting evangelical" [...] for several years as a teenager. In school, Hanks was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible." [...] In 1965, his father married Frances Wong, a San Francisco native of Chinese descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Hanks during his high school years. Hanks acted in school plays, including South Pacific, while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.|$|E
2500|$|Hank {{referred}} to Chuck D {{as being the}} person who'd find all the vocal samples, Eric Sadler as [...] "the one with the musical talent," [...] and noted that his brother, Keith Shocklee, [...] "knew {{a lot of the}} breakbeats and was the sound-effects master." [...] Shocklee's sentiments were reinforced by Chuck D while explaining the group's working methods during production. [...] "Eric was the musician, Hank was the antimusician. Eric did a lot of the [...] programming, [...] Keith <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who would bring in the feel." [...] For his contributions to the production side, Chuck stated that he [...] "would scour for vocal samples all over the Earth. I would name a song, tag it, and get the vocal samples." [...] Chuck D also noted the productiveness of Sadler and Shocklee's differing approaches to the creative process. [...] "The friction between Hank and Eric worked very well. Hank would put a twist on Eric's musicianship and Eric's musicianship would put a twist on Hank." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Washington, Barnett lobbied Congress {{and presidents}} to end China's isolation. In an {{interview}} with the New York Times shortly before his death, Barnett recalled a private meeting he attended between Richard Nixon and China scholars in 1969: [...] "I always felt that Nixon <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> because of his background...I am not sure the Democrats would have been capable of taking a major step toward China because of the fear of being clobbered". He coined the formula [...] "containment without isolation" [...] to describe a diplomatic opening that would still recognize China as a danger. In 1974 Barnett noted that Americans tended to shape their views of China “to fit their own preconceptions and mood of the moment, with minimal understanding of the realities of the situation.” [...] In the late 1970s, he supported President Jimmy Carter 's drive to follow Nixon's 1972 breakthrough with formal diplomatic recognition of China. In the early 1980s he advised against the sale of modernized jet fighters to the Republic of China on Taiwan, a position that was followed in the presidency of Ronald Reagan.|$|E
