However, initial wind characteristic study and spatial <b>wind</b> <b>mapping</b> need to be established prior to develop wind energy systems.

The aim of this study was to conduct initial wind characteristic study and spatial <b>wind</b> <b>mapping</b> in Malaysia. <b>Wind</b> data measured at a height of 10 m for nine selected potential sites in Malaysia were obtained from the Malaysian Meteorological Department. In this study, variations of wind speed according to height, Weibull distribution and spatial <b>wind</b> <b>mapping</b> by Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) were analyzed. The results revealed that, both wind resources at sites, Mersing and Kudat, had higher potential to develop a modern wind system.

This study looked the how ASAR and model <b>wind</b> <b>maps</b> compare in terms of estimating coastal wind climates, and whether they can identify local features important to wind farm siting.

To get a better idea of how the model and ASAR wind estimates fare in a coastal region, both descriptive statistics and an in-depth analysis of individual ASAR scenes have been made. The in-depth analysis of individual scenes revealed several instances of wind features such as atmospheric gravity waves and wind shadowing which were present in the ASAR <b>wind</b> <b>maps</b> but absent or poorly defined in the model <b>wind</b> <b>maps.</b> Identifying the extent and location of features connected to turbulence or wind shadows can be essential to siting, and it was possible to identify several locations where special care should be taken in estimating the wind climate...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{the share}} of {{renewable}} energy sources {{is one of the}} core policies of the European Union. This is {{because of the fact that}} this energy is essential in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions and securing energy supplies. Currently, {{the share of}} wind energy from all renewable energy sources is relatively low. The choice of location for a certain wind farm installation strongly depends on the wind potential. Therefore the accurate assessment of wind potential is extremely important. In the present paper an analysis is made on the impact of significant possible parameters on the determination of wind energy potential for relatively large areas. In the analysis the type of measurements (short- and long-term on-site measurements), the type of instrumentation and the terrain roughness factor are considered.

40|$|The {{research}} project entitled "Establishing The <b>Wind</b> <b>Map</b> of Sabah and Sarawak" had commenced in April 2003 {{with the aim}} of studying the wind characteristic, producing the <b>wind</b> <b>map</b> and determining the possible sites of producing electricity using the technology of low wind speed wind turbine (LWSWT) in the two countries. Wind data for the 10 meteorological stations in Sabah and Sarawak had been obtained from `Malaysia Meteorological Department', Petaling Jaya, Selangor. Wind data for a period of 5 consecutive years (1998 - 2002) for each meteorological station had been processed, analyzed and used in this research. All the 5 meteorological stations in Sarawak (Kucing, Sri Aman, Sibu, Bintulu and Miri meteorological stations) are situated near the coast line whereas there is none in the vast interior areas of the country. This, in fact caused some hindrance to the process of establishing the <b>wind</b> <b>map</b> of Sarawak itself. To accelerate the process, wind data for Bario, Belaga and Kapit had been established through the wind strength correlations between these places and the existing meteorological stations in Sarawak and Labuan. Sabah on the other hand, although all the 4 existing meteorological stations in the country also situated near the coast line but these locations are seems to be well arranged like a circle encircling the entire country. Hence, the wind data for only a single interior location had been established through wind strength correlation. The said identified location was Tongod and the wind data has been predicted through the wind strength correlation between this location and all the 4 existing meteorological stations in Sabah (Kota Kinabalu, Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau meteorological stations) and Labuan. Wind, roughness and obstacle data for each o f t he meteorological and identified w ind strength correlated stations in Sabah and Sarawak had been processed in accordance to the need and requirement of the WAsP Commercial Software. The processed data were then fed into the software in order to establish the <b>wind</b> <b>map</b> for Sabah and Sarawak at the heights of 20 and 50 meters above ground level. Wind data from Mulu meteorological station had been used in validating the accuracy of prediction portrayed the <b>wind</b> <b>map</b> of Sarawak for the height of 20 meters above ground.

Three types of wind maps for Sabah and Sarawak had been established i. e. the North East Monsoon Season, the South West Monsoon Season and the Yearly Wind Maps.

40|$|In the {{following}} work, we propose {{an assessment of}} wind potential in Algeria. The {{purpose of this study}} is twofold. First, to draw the attention to the important wind potential in the region of Hassi-R'mel. In the previous maps, the wind potential in this region has been underestimated due the fact that it is located between two less windy regions. Second, the actualization of the <b>wind</b> <b>map</b> of Algeria using very recent data stretching from February 2004 to December 2009. This paper is structured in three main parts. First, a stochastic and the cyclic study of the wind behaviors in the site of Hassi-R'mel are proposed. The stochastic study is carried out by fitting the wind speed data to Weibull distribution while the cyclic study is carried out via the use of time-frequency analysis. We have used the time-frequency analyses instead of the traditional Fourier analysis due its ability to follow the spectrum variation with respect to time. As results, it has been found that spectrum wind process enfold many limited interval oscillations. In the second part, we propose to contribute to the actualisation of the <b>wind</b> <b>map</b> in Algeria. In this part, we have considered also the topographical aspect of Algeria. Such consideration is very helpful for understanding the wind potential reparation over the country.
