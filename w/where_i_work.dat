50|$|Today if I write {{instead of}} {{building}} canals and power plants {{it is due}} to two things: the impact of meeting Yeghishe Charents, and second, the touch of ancient manuscripts at the Matenadaran library <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> as a student and could read and hold the magnificent old manuscripts from the fifth through the eighteenth centuries.|$|R
60|$|After I had pawned my things, and had begged a small {{advance of}} wages {{at the place}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> to make up what was still wanting to pay for Mary's funeral, I thought I {{might have had a}} little quiet time to prepare myself as I best could for to-morrow.

The shop close to me, at which I usually deal, would be shut up, I knew, before I could get to it; so I determined to go into the first place I passed where candles were sold.

The girls average from eighteen bob to a pound a week, men twenty-four to twenty-eight, foremen thirty-five to two pounds. It's not much of wages. The house rent's high in these parts, and food, too. The business has just been turned into a company--capital three hundred thousand pounds, profits last year forty-two thousand. That's after paying us our bit. That's the sort of thing turns the blood of the people sour up here. It was the aristocrats brought about the revolution in France.

5000|$|In 2000 an Australian {{consultant}} {{made several}} large {{changes to the}} show that would see a more working class hospital portrayed. Joe, his wife Te Hana and children Mihi and Tama were created because of this. As part of the revamp, producers wished for a more community based cast with established family links, mimicking the past presence of the Warner and McKenna families. Rawiri Paratene was cast in the role. The Hudson's arrival {{was said to be}} a [...] "shock" [...] for the established character of Te Hana's brother, Victor Kahu (Calvin Tuteao). Paratene stated upon gaining the role, [...] "It's fantastic to be here. I've come from a situation where I worked with young actors who looked up to me for guidance.

Journalist Chips Mackinolty, who met Ansell in the 1980s, described him as [...] "articulate and likable, if somewhat intense." [...] However, Ansell's new-found fame alienated him from his peers, and he later lamented of his rejection back home:Proving the point about the story being true or not wouldn't matter that much. Because the people it would affect, who affect me, {{are the people who}} live <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>work,</b> and know me. And people up here have a phobia about appearing on the media. So that was detrimental to my standing in their eyes...they thought it was a terrible thing to do.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s on homes and community living in the United Kingdom was the [...] "influential paper [...] "An Ordinary Life"" [...] which was shared in the US through our internationally known colleague David Towell, then of the King's Fund and Great Britain's National Development Team. One of his books, An Ordinary Life in Practice, was paired with his strategic framework for principled national change. Within the comprehensive book (1988), Richard Brazil and Nan Carle describe an ordinary home life, Linda Ward describes developing opportunities for an ordinary community life, Paul Williams and Alan Tyne values for service development (normalization-based, Wolf Wolfensberger), Alice Etherington, Keven Hall & Emma Whelan as service users (where I live, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>work),</b> Philippa Russell on children and families, Jan Porterfield on regular employment, the late James Mansell on training, David Towell on managing strategic change, and Roger Blunden on safeguarding quality, among others.|$|E
50|$|Sir Wilbraham T. Ford, {{who at the}} {{beginning}} of the war was Admiral Superintendent at the Dockyard, has now moved, together with many of his naval offices, to Lascaris. He is a big man, built like a bastion, always tirelessly on the go. And what's more, he is never grumpy or moody like most of the top brass around here. He wears khaki trousers and shirt, without ribbons, medals or epaulettes, and black shoes. To see him go by reminds one of an old-time constable on holiday. It's hard to believe he is one of the top three who will decide the fate of Malta and its people. From time to time he comes out of his office, which is close to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>work,</b> lights up a cigarette, draws a hearty draft, and sets about teasing the janitors sweeping or otherwise working in the courtyard. I have seen him hide a broom or a bucket behind a door, and then act as if he has no idea where they went when a janitor comes looking for them. And after every prank, he bursts out laughing like a boy without a care in the world. Wherever one meets him, he is taking the mickey out of someone, repeating some silly phrase in Maltese, or teasing the menial workmen. He keeps his shirtsleeves rolled up, revealing a pair of heavily tattooed arms. He is as tough and strict with the English officers working under him as he is kind and gentle with the subordinates. It was terrifying once hearing him berate a Commander for some minor infringement - the poor officer could have died for shame. As long as England has people like Sir Wilbraham Ford in command, she may yet win a war which today, to me, appears lost.|$|E

The significance of the environment, i. e., our upbringing, lifestyle and the world around us is often emphasized by psychologists as the more dominant force, however our genes are just as, if not more, influential on our lives.
