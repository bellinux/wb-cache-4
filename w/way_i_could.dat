Recently the only <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx {{against the back of the}} chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
500|$|The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago {{received}} Till's body. Upon arrival, Bradley {{insisted on}} viewing {{it to make}} a positive identification, later stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away. She decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying, [...] "There was just no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see." [...] Tens {{of thousands of people}} lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, LaBeouf contributed {{an essay}} {{to the book}} I Am Jewish, by Judea Pearl, in which LaBeouf stated {{that he has a}} [...] "personal {{relationship}} with God that happens to work within the confines of Judaism". He has described himself as Jewish, but declared in 2007 that religion had [...] "never made sense" [...] to him. [...] However, in an interview published in Interview magazine in October 2014, LaBeouf stated [...] "I found God doing Fury. I became a Christian man, and not in a fucking bullshit wayin a very real <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have just said the prayers that were on the page.

[...] Sky set a high pace in pursuit of the leading group, and with [...] to go, Chris Froome attacked, {{followed}} by Tejay van Garderen, and they soon passed the leaders. With [...] remaining, Froome attacked to win the stage by a margin of seventeen seconds. Van Garderen moved into the lead of the general classification, and although placing second in the stage, he was content, saying [...] "My tactic was just to mark Froome and when he went there was no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> follow him, but I'm very happy with the yellow jersey." ...|$|E
500|$|Metallica's {{performance}} at the ceremony, held in February 1989 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, {{marked the first time}} a heavy metal group had performed during the Grammy Awards. Metallica was expected to win the award, and members of Jethro Tull were told by their record label Chrysalis Records not to bother attending the ceremony because they [...] "weren't likely to win." [...] However, Jethro Tull won the award (recipients included members Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, and Dave Pegg), and when presenters Alice Cooper and Lita Ford announced the result, booing could be heard from the crowd. Anderson, who assumed that the band was being recognized for their twenty-year history, as opposed to a single album, later stated that he was [...] "lucky" [...] not to have attended the ceremony, as [...] "there's no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have accepted it under those circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Solar 2 {{lasted for}} at least ten months. The game was {{developed}} using Microsoft XNA, a set of tools focused on video game development created by Microsoft. According to Watts, Solar 2 was [...] "mainly expanding on [...] original idea and polishing it to perfection." [...] However, he commented {{that the concept of}} both games took several design iterations to reach its final version: [...] "I played with many, many ideas before finally settling on what I have now." [...] Sound designer and musician JP Neufeld composed the game's score. According to Watts, this was done because there was [...] "no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do music as good as he can." [...] Both the Windows and Xbox 360 version of the game were developed simultaneously. About the Xbox 360 version, Watts commented that [...] "the lack of keyboards and the aging Xbox 360 hardware were a bit tricky, and updating the Xbox version is a huge pain to do." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States on November 28, 1941, ten days before the United States entered World War II militarily, alongside the Allied Forces. During the war years, she actively sought out ways to express her patriotism {{and contribute to the}} war effort. In May 1942, she joined the Hollywood Victory Caravan, a three-week train tour of the country that raised money through the sale of war bonds. Later that year she began attending events at the Hollywood Canteen, meeting and dancing with the troops. In December 1943 deHavilland joined a USO tour that traveled throughout the United States, Alaska, and the South Pacific, visiting wounded soldiers in military hospitals. She earned the respect and admiration of the troops for visiting the isolated islands and battlefronts in the Pacific. She survived flights in damaged aircraft and a bout with viral pneumonia requiring several days' stay in one of the island barrack hospitals. She later remembered, [...] "I loved doing the tours because it was a <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> serve my country and contribute to the war effort." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E

Roper said [...] "I raced that thing seven nights a week, even {{in the middle of}} winter, on a figure-eight dirt track, the kind you pass in the middle both <b>ways.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get that Chevy up to speeds of 60 to 70 miles per hour." ...|$|R
500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1942, at {{the time}} when Stanley was {{preparing}} the draft drawings of the murals, the Japanese began an action which would become known as the Selarang Barracks Incident. It was an incident concerning seventeen thousand Anglo-Australian POWs, who were forced to vacate their buildings and be exposed for nearly five days in the open without water or sanitation for refusing to sign a [...] "No Escape Pledge". Against this backdrop, Stanley began to paint the murals. No one had asked the Japanese for permission to draw and at no stage did they interfere with his work. Considering the purpose of the murals, Stanley felt that the Chapel was basically dedicated to peace and reconciliation, and so he choose universal themes for the murals which would embrace all mankind. Paint was not readily available in the camp, but with the aid of the other prisoners, who unquestionably put themselves at great risk, materials to make the paint were gradually acquired—brown camouflage paint, a small amount of crimson paint, white oil paint and billiard chalk were found and brought for Stanley use. Despite still being very ill, Stanley set to work on the murals in early September 1942. His illness meant that he could only paint for a limited period each day, for perhaps 15 minutes at a time followed by a rest. To compensate {{as much as he could}} for the lack of coloured paint, Stanley resorted to using large brush strokes and big areas of solid colour when painting. In September 1942, a few weeks after Stanley began painting the murals, he was informed that his work party was to be sent north to Thailand to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. A colonel in charge of the hospital, who knew of his work-in-progress murals, intervened to have Stanley transferred back to the hospital so that he could continue on his work in the Chapel. Most of Stanley's unit who went to the Thai-Burma Railway never returned. Stanley recounted: [...] "Had I gone with them, most certainly, I would have died. So the murals very directly saved my life in the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never have foreseen... It's a terrible sense of debt... that one feels to the chapel." ...|$|E

[...] When Muir arrived at Cedar Keys, he began working for Richard Hodgson at Hodgson's sawmill. However, three days after accepting the job at Hodgson's, Muir almost died of a malarial sickness.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Bowles {{had been}} asked some years earlier to play Jerry Leadbetter, the husband of Keith's Margo, in The Good Life. Owing to prior commitments, Bowles turned down the role, but had he played Jerry, it is {{unlikely}} {{he would have been}} offered the part of Richard; as Bowles later said, [...] "there's no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have played Penelope Keith's screen husband in two separate sitcoms". However, in 1987 Bowles replaced Geoffrey Palmer as Keith's onscreen husband in the ITV sitcom Executive Stress.|$|E

2500|$|Cameron {{enrolled}} at Fullerton College, a two-year community college, in 1973 to study physics. He switched to English, then dropped {{out before the}} start of the fall 1974 semester. Next, he worked several jobs, including as a truck driver, writing when he had time. During this period he taught himself about special effects: [...] "I'd go down to the USC library and pull any thesis that graduate students had written about optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology. That <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sit down and read it, and if they'd let me photocopy it, I would. If not, I'd make notes." ...|$|E

I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything.
