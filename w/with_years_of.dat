5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

While working on his bachelor's degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, he wrote short stories. One of his stories, The Dowry, was twice selected for broadcast by BBC World Service {{while he was in}} graduate school. During schooling, he was introduced to south Indian classical music, especially on the veena, and followed this up <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> training on the vocals.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, the government's {{attempt to}} legislate Article 23 (National Security) of the Basic Law aroused strong {{suspicion}} among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property on grounds of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E

Burton's Vincent and Frankenweenie were also included. Both DVDs were non-anamorphic widescreen releases.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{emerged in}} early 1997 that Keating was {{planning}} {{a run for}} district attorney (DA) of Norfolk County. He faced two former Norfolk assistant DAs, John J. Corrigan and William P. O'Donnell, in the Democratic primary. Keating, whose name recognition was boosted by the attempted Bulger coup, presented his work on public safety, criminal justice, and judiciary committees as a strength, while the other candidates pointed to his lack of courtroom experience as a disqualifier. While Keating held a part-time law practice during his legislative career, he lacked exposure to the criminal cases handled by the DA's office. After winning the Democratic nomination, Keating faced incumbent DA Jeffrey A. Locke in the November 1998 general election. Locke, a Republican, had been appointed to the position by Governor Weld the previous year after the resignation of Bill Delahunt. <b>With</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience as a prosecutor, Locke portrayed Keating as a career politician and echoed his primary opponents' criticism of his experience. Keating highlighted a range of endorsements from police organizations, and from Delahunt, as evidence of his criminal justice qualifications. Aided by a Democratic-leaning electorate, Keating won the election with around 55 percent of the vote.|$|E

In reality VR were only able to build an average of 4 locomotives and 200 wagons per year, and these gains had been counteracted by long overdue scrappings.|$|E
25|$|In {{those times}} before radar, knowing the boat's route {{well enough to}} run profitably day and night, in all seasons, in clear weather and fog, took {{extraordinary}} skill, using among other things, fixing the steamboat's location by the timing and sound of echoes from the vessel's whistle blasts, a skill {{that could only be}} reached <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience on the route. Flyers officers did not change much, with Captain Williamson and also Capt. Everett B. Coffin (1865–1950) acting as her masters for most of the time on the Seattle-Tacoma route, and there was a similar lack of turnover among her engineers.|$|E

25|$|In 320 BC the consul Quintus Publilius Philo and Lucius Papirius Cursor {{marched to}} Apulia. This move threw the Samnites off. Publilius headed for Luceria, where the Roman hostages were held. He routed a Samnite contingent. However, the Samnites regrouped and besieged the Romans outside Luceria. The army of Papirius {{advanced}} {{along the coast}} as far as Arpi. The people of that area were well disposed towards the Romans because they were fed up <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Samnite raids. They supplied the besieged Romans with corn. This forced the Samnites to engage Papirius. There was an indecisive battle and Papirius besieged the Samnites who then surrendered and passed under the yoke. Luceria was taken and the Roman hostages were freed.|$|E

25|$|Cowdrey tended towards {{caution and}} drew 15 of his 27 Tests in command, but won eight Tests, lost only four (two each to Australia and the West Indies). For {{one reason or}} another he only captained England in two full series, against South Africa in 1960 and the West Indies in 1967–68, and won both. He was a shrewd cricket captain <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience; Tom Graveney thought him the best captain he served under, and Graveney played under every England captain from 1951 to 1969. In the field Cowdrey {{preferred}} to set the best field for his bowlers and stick to it rather than make constant changes. His greatest asset was the care he took over his players, always thanking bowlers after they had bowled a spell and batsmen when they returned to the pavilion.|$|E

25|$|In England, in {{the absence}} of census figures, historians propose a range of pre-incident {{population}} figures from as high as 7million to as low as 4million in 1300, and a post-incident population figure as low as 2million. By the end of 1350 the Black Death had subsided, but it never really died out in England over the next few hundred years: there were further outbreaks in 1361–62, 1369, 1379–83, 1389–93, and throughout {{the first half of the}} 15th century. The plague often killed 10% of a community in less than a year—in the worst epidemics, such as at Norwich in 1579 and Newcastle in 1636, as many as 30 or 40%. The most general outbreaks in Tudor and Stuart England, all coinciding <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> plague in Germany and the Low Countries, seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636.|$|E
25|$|Adema is a nu metal {{band from}} Bakersfield, California. The band formed in 2000 with members lead vocalist Mark Chavez, vocalist/guitarist Tim Fluckey, guitarist Mike Ransom, bassist Dave DeRoo, and drummer Kris Kohls. After {{their first two}} albums, Adema, and Unstable, the band was plagued <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{conflict}} and lineup changes. Ransom left the band in 2003 due to conflicts with Chavez followed by Chavez later in 2004 due to conflicts {{with the rest of}} the band. Luke Caraccioli replaced Chavez in early 2005 for one album, Planets, but then left a few months later in late 2005. Vocalist Bobby Reeves and guitarist Ed Farris, both from the band Level, were recruited to join as well, but only released one album, Kill the Headlights in 2007, before entering a hiatus. The band's original line up reformed in late 2009 and toured, but both Ransom and Chavez left again before any new music would be recorded. Fluckey took over lead vocals from 2011 to 2017. The lineup released an EP, Topple the Giants. In 2013 Ransom returned once again; Chavez rejoined the band again in March 2017, solidifying the current line-up.|$|E
25|$|As the war {{continued}} {{it became}} apparent that the single Panzer Badge was no longer adequate to recognize the growing number of veterans <b>with</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience, and in June 1943 four new classes of the award were introduced for 25, 50, 75 and 100 engagements. These new badges consisted of an award that was similar to the unnumbered Panzer Badge, but with a box showing the Arabic numeral of the class {{at the base of the}} wreath. The badge was slightly larger for the 25 and 50 type with the 75 and 100 being larger still. The wreath in the case of the 25 and 50 was silvered, while in the 75 and 100 class it was gilt. The center of the badge (the tank) was made of a separate striking and chemically darkened in the case of the 25 and 50 class, while in the 75 and 100 class the tank was silvered. The reverse has several variations, and could either have a slim or wide pin. The 50 and 100 engagement badges were struck in a lightweight zinc alloy; this was so that the larger pin did not pull inconveniently on the tunic.|$|E
