25|$|The European Super Cup {{was created}} in 1971 by Anton Witkamp, a {{reporter}} and later sports editor of Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. The idea came {{to him in a}} time when Dutch total football was Europe's finest and Dutch football clubs were living their golden era (especially Ajax). Witkamp <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> new to definitely decide which was the best team in Europe and also to further test Ajax's legendary team, led by their star player Johan Cruyff. It was then proposed that the winner of the European Cup would face the winner of the European Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
25|$|Some educated parties {{note that}} the USL v. BSDi case had shown that the Unix {{copyrights}} are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed patent infringement, as according to the US Patent and Trademark Office database, no AT or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX trademark was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.|$|E

500|$|Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{described}} {{the writing process}} as, [...] "When we were writing this album I <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> to beat; I wanted something to beat, but nothing impresses me right now. Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat it, so I just {{had to come up}} with my own shit."

500|$|Concept {{illustrator}} {{and designer}} of Iron Man's Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that [...] "Joss Whedon <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> {{that had the}} 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit , while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle." [...] To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in Iron Man2 {{as well as some}} ideas that had been abandoned in Iron Man and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack. The Science & Entertainment Exchange also provided science consultation for the film.|$|E
500|$|While {{still at}} EC, Kurtzman had overseen {{the first five}} Mad pocket books {{published}} by Ballantine Books, which became perennial sellers with sales in the millions. [...] When Kurtzman left EC, his royalties from the books ceased and Gaines had Kurtzman's name removed from them. [...] In 1958 Gaines abandoned Ballantine for Signet Books. [...] Kurtzman proposed an original paperback to Ian Ballantine, who <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> to replace the Mad line. [...] Kurtzman was well respected at the Ballantine offices, and it was editor Bernard Shir-Cliff who provided Kurtzman with the postcard of the gap-toothed character that was to become Mads mascot AlfredE. Neuman. [...] Ballantine had earlier published The Humbug Digest in the same format with material culled from Kurtzman's Humbug magazine, though it fared poorly in the market.|$|E

500|$|Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> {{more stable}} than the usual feature movies. He decided to {{audition}} after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed {{that he was trying}} out for Angel's son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. [...] "Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed that I just fit right in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude." [...] Instead, he was told to just [...] "stand up straight, [...] normal voice," [...] and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.|$|E
500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my {{defensive}} rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E
500|$|Stone {{met with}} Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but the {{director}} had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Stone liked the [...] "stiffness" [...] of Sheen's acting style {{and used it}} to convey Bud's naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in Romancing the Stone and <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, [...] "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that [...] "when he's acting he gives it his all". Stone said that he saw [...] "that villain quality" [...] in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I’d never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable". For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.|$|E

500|$|Reid's ideas, however, [...] "were prosaic in the extreme". [...] His {{promotions}} included printing {{the sports}} section on green newsprint and a pocket-sized magazine for television listings that initially stopped the Sunday paper's circulation skid, but proved an empty product. [...] The Tribune turned a profit in 1956, but the Times was rapidly outpacing it in news content, circulation, and ad revenue. [...] The promotions largely failed {{to hold on to}} the Tribunes new audiences; the Sunday edition began to slide again and the paper fell into the red in 1957. Through the decade, the Tribune was the only newspaper in the city to see its share of ad lineage drop, and longtime veterans of the paper, including Bigart, began departing. The Reids, who had by now turned their mortgage into stock, began seeking buyers to infuse the Tribune with cash, turning to John Hay [...] "Jock" [...] Whitney, whose family had a long association with the Reids. [...] Whitney, recently named ambassador to Great Britain, had chaired Dwight Eisenhower's fundraising campaigns in 1952 and 1956 and <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> else to engage him beyond his largely ceremonial role in Great Britain. [...] Whitney, who [...] "did not want the Tribune to die", gave the newspaper $1.2 million over the objections of his investment advisors, who had doubts about the newspaper's viability. The loan came with the option to take controlling interest of the newspaper if he made a second loan of $1.3 million. [...] Brown Reid expected the $1.2 million to cover a deficit that would last through the end of 1958, but by that year the newspaper's loss was projected at $3 million, and Whitney and his advisors decided to exercise their option. The Reids, claiming to have put $20 million into the newspaper since the 1924 merger [...] initially attempted to keep editorial control of the paper, but Whitney made it clear he would not invest additional money in the Tribune if the Reids remained at the helm. [...] The family yielded, and Helen, Whitie and Brown Reid announced Whitney's takeover of the newspaper on August 28, 1958. The Reids retained a substantial stake in the Tribune until its demise, but Whitney and his advisors controlled the paper.|$|E

Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985. Key's concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group's first song ever recorded, [...] "K-9".
