5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Anbe Sivam commenced in July 2002. The {{first scene}} featuring the lead actors {{was shot at}} Pollachi Junction railway station. Kamal and Madhavan interacted closely during {{the initial stages of}} the shoot to ensure that the on-screen chemistry between the pair <b>was</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E

5|$|The latter {{three were}} {{canceled}} {{before reaching the}} market. By 1997, it <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that the IA-64 architecture and the compiler were {{much more difficult to}} implement than originally thought, and the delivery timeframe of Merced began slipping.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom <b>was</b> <b>apparent,</b> {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases were trapped in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Canberra {{became the}} first {{city in the world}} to set a vision of no waste, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion. The {{strategy}} aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community. By early 2010, it <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that though it had reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years at Croydon, girls tended to be {{enrolled}} at an older age, typically over fourteen. It <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. As today, {{it was not a}} requirement for students to be Presbyterians, and early school records indicate {{there were a number of}} Roman Catholic and Jewish students. By 1900 the reputation of the school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.|$|E

50|$|The recent loss of Dvořák's {{second child}} <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> in his works from this period. The quartet, like the Stabat Mater and Piano trio, is sad and nostalgic. Although {{nominally}} {{in a major}} key, themes are often presented in a minor key. The expression of melancholy and sorrow <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> throughout the work.|$|R
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E
5|$|Mustelids {{have never}} colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that cats killed kakapo {{at a rate}} of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and {{therefore}} an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kakapo were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.|$|E

5|$|Ramirez {{attended}} George Washington High School from 1987 to 1991, leaving {{at the age}} of 19 without graduating. During {{his time}} on the team, GWHS was seeing a large {{increase in the number of}} immigrants. This <b>was</b> <b>apparent,</b> as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans. As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be the center of attention and was often very modest.|$|E
5|$|The Danish cavalry, {{under the}} Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt (not to be {{confused}} with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.|$|E
5|$|The NK 2nd Division {{made a new}} effort {{against the}} 23rd Infantry's {{perimeter}} in the predawn hours of September 8, {{in an attempt to}} break through eastward. This attack, launched at 02:30 and heavily supported with artillery, penetrated F Company. It <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that unless F Company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse. When all its officers became casualties, First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson, adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, assumed command of the company.|$|E

5|$|By 9:00am it <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> {{that the}} two gunmen possessed {{superior}} weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill {{to bring in a}} detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, it <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle {{and many of the}} royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 it <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work {{to repair the}} stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely {{climbed to the top}} of the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E

5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Selfe family {{landed at}} Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One {{of the reasons}} they emigrated to the colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small house that had previously been the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Project A119 remained largely secret until the mid-1990s, when writer Keay Davidson discovered the story while researching {{the life of}} Carl Sagan for a biography. Sagan's involvement with the project <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> from his application for an academic scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley's Miller Institute in 1959. In the application, Sagan gave details of the project research, which Davidson felt constituted a violation of national security. The leak consisted of Sagan revealing the titles of two classified papers from the A119 project—the 1958 paper Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy, and the 1959 paper Radiological Contamination of the Moon by Nuclear Weapons Detonations. A 1958 paper titled Cosmic Radiation and Lunar Radioactivity, credited to I. Filosofo, was also named by Sagan in a 1961 paper written for the United States National Research Council. These were among the eight reports created by the project, {{all of which were}} destroyed in 1987.|$|E
