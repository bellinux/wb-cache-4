Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had {{members in the}} same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made {{at the time of}} his election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.|$|E

The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz, Richard Zajdlic, Tony Saint and Simon Burke were {{contracted}} as {{the series}} writers, while Alex Holmes, Bill Eagles, Paul Wilmshurst and Daniel Percival {{serve as the}} series directors. Andy Harries and Elaine Pyke were the show's executive producers, with Percival and Spotnitz working as Co-Executive Producers. In addition, Michael Casey, Trevor Hopkins and Sue De Beauvoir were the series producers, with Bill Shepard serving as co-producer. Spotnitz wrote the first episodes. He was approached to write for the series because the producers needed somebody to reimagine the show as Armitage was committed to The Hobbit in New Zealand, by introducing two new leads. Spotnitz described the process; [...] "We had this great format, this great world of 'Strike Back' {{and then we had}} to imagine who were the new characters <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive the show in the second year." [...] Before Project Dawn was even announced, the crew were scouting for locations in South Africa, where the first series was shot, as well as investigating {{other parts of the world}} including the United States, South America, and Europe.|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't.

It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney.

500|$|Instead, Stabæk started {{negotiating}} with IT Fornebu {{to take over}} a lot they owned. They needed a [...] lot which would have a market value of between NOK60 and 80 million, and Reinsfelt stated that the municipality was willing to help by [...] "maneuver in gray areas within the margins". The club was further pressured by NFF, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> limit the exceptions allowed for Nadderud and other stadiums not meeting their criteria. On 29 October, FB and Stabæk signed an agreement whereby Stabæk received a free lot and NOK50 million, in exchange for FB taking over the commercial properties. The condition was that the municipality allowed a more dense use of the rest of FB's area. This would require a re-regulation of the area, and Reinsfelt estimated {{that it would not be}} possible for construction to start until 2006. In November, UEFA changed the rules for artificial turf to state that it had to be green. Until Stabæk's proposal was made, UEFA had not though that anyone would build a pitch with a non-green turf, and representatives stated that it was because of Stabæk the rule change was made. The plans were nearly terminated in October 2006, after discussion about the planned Fornebu Line—a people mover which would connect Fornebu to Lysaker—stopped the regulation plan. However, in November the final permissions were granted by Bærum Municipality. On 22 December, Stabæk announced that the financing was secured.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened.

[...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which {{was the subject of a}} Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Warren {{intended}} Johnson {{to become}} involved in trading with American Indians, but Johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north, {{on the opposite side of}} the river from Warrensburgh. Acting on his own initiative, in 1739 Johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river, where he built a store and a sawmill. From this location, which he called [...] "Mount Johnson", Johnson was able to cut into Albany's Indian trade. He supplied traders with goods <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Fort Oswego, and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver. He dealt directly with New York City merchants and cut out the previous middlemen at Albany. The Albany merchants were irate, and Warren was not pleased that his nephew was becoming independent.|$|E

In response to Holder's speech, Hanson wrote a column titled [...] "Facing Facts about Race" [...] where he offered up his own version (and others') of [...] "the Talk", namely the need to inform his children to be careful of young black men when venturing into the inner city, who Hanson argued were statistically more likely to commit violent crimes than young men of other races, and that therefore it was understandable for the police to focus on groups with the highest statistical crime rates, which turn out to be young black males.|$|E
