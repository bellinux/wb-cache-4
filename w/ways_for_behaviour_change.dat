40|$|A {{central point}} of {{departure}} for this socio-legal study about online hate crimes concerns the significance of analysing and understanding social norms in relation to these crimes on the Internet. This is of importance not least when one approaches the issue of how law and the legal system may contribute towards positive developments in this field and prevent hate crimes. It is apparent that law and social norms function concurrently in influencing behaviours. On the one hand, social norms have a strong impact on how law is formulated due to law typically being shaped to reflect the morals and values in society. On the other hand, the reverse effect can also play an important role: When law leads and paves the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>changed</b> <b>behaviours,</b> it may in time produce changes in social norms. People tend to revaluate their views of right and wrong and adapt their values towards legally advocated behaviour. People also tend to make demands of their social environment in a manner that coincides with legally grounded values. Through clear legal signals, processes are initiated that have the potential, in time, to lead to changed social norms. People must, then, not only consider the legally constructed risk involved in being caught, sentenced and punished, we must also relate to the risk of being condemned by our fellow citizens. The empirical study is made in Sweden and the article present the Swedish legal and social context related to different hate crimes and how these phenomena are perceived among Swedish Internet users...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Behaviour</b> <b>change</b> {{interventions}} {{are effective in}} supporting individuals in achieving temporary <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> <b>Behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance, however, is rarely attained. The aim of this review was to identify and synthesise current theoretical explanations <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance to inform future research and practice. Methods: Potentially relevant theories were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO). In addition, an existing database of 80 theories was searched, and 25 theory experts were consulted. Theories were included if they formulated hypotheses about <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance. Included theories were synthesised thematically to ascertain overarching explanations <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance. Initial theoretical themes were cross-validated. Findings: One hundred and seventeen behaviour theories were identified, of which 100 met the inclusion criteria. Five overarching, interconnected themes representing theoretical explanations <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance emerged. Theoretical explanations of <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance focus on the differential nature and role of motives, self-regulation, resources (psychological and physical), habits, and environmental and social influences from initiation to maintenance. Discussion: There are distinct patterns of theoretical explanations <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> and <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance. The findings from this review can guide the development and evaluation of interventions promoting maintenance of health behaviours and help {{in the development of}} an integrated theory of <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance...|$|R

However, investigation of this issue is limited by lack of theoretically and empirically sound measures of motivation <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> among sex offenders. This paper reports on two studies that were conducted to investigate the psychometric properties (validity, reliability, and social desirability) of the Stages of Change Questionnaire, adapted to measure motivation <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> among sex offenders against children. In Study 1, {{the psychometric properties of}} the questionnaire were assessed for sex offenders against children (n= 36) who were on a treatment waiting list. In Study 2, the psychometric properties of the questionnaire were assessed for sex offenders against children (n= 47) at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Both studies supported the validity and reliability of the adapted Stages of Change Questionnaire, and the influence of social desirability upon responding was less than expected.

We critically examine this assumption through a qualitative study of a smoking cessation app, called NewLeaf, which allows quitters to swap personal stories. The study examined what influenced people to engage or disengage with NewLeaf, and how the app was deployed in quit attempts during a four week trial. Several properties of swapped stories were reported to promote engagement, including: authenticity, currency, contextualization of advice, and evoking a sense of community. But while the resulting engagement was sometimes productive in supporting quitting, other trajectories of use were observed involving counterproductive engagement, and a surprising pattern of productive disengagement especially among stronger quitters. We discuss how this analysis of different trajectories problematizes any simple interpretation of user engagement as an early indicator of success <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> technologies...|$|R

Most examples of <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> interventions have as setting Western and developed countries. Environmental damage affects people in diverse parts of the globe, and recently severe droughts caused water shortage in the most populous areas in Brazil. This paper reports on workshops conducted with Brazilian students as a way to foster the generation of ideas and development of strategies to promote sustainable behaviours regarding water use, and therefore reduce consumption and waste. The ideas proposed during these workshops were classified according to established models of design <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> and sustainable <b>behaviour,</b> indicating the categories of the most frequent suggestions. Results demonstrated how the idea generation sessions were capable of producing interesting solutions to reduce consumption that could help to tackle the problem of water shortage. However, the short duration of these exercises meant that suggestions were limited in terms of scope and evaluation of impact.

Method: A literature review was carried out and ten scientific articles were analyzed and compiled in two main categories: design of these interventions and participation in them. Results: Education, decision making, goal setting, feedback, social support and follow-up were identified as critical elements <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> The interventions that all showed positive effects on diet, physical activity or feedback from participants were mainly carried out by dieticians, physicians and registered nurses.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis was on {{investigating}} the key questions regarding the effectiveness of monetary rewards as a tool <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> in rehabilitation. Firstly, do rewards consistently influence the eye movement behaviour in a neuro-typical human population? Secondly, do these effects persist once rewards are withdrawn? Finally, do these effects transfer to other unrewarded eye movement tasks? Nine experiments investigated the influence of monetary rewards on oculomotor function and attention in humans. Monetary rewards were found to consistently influence human saccadic behaviour such that faster eye movements were generated to rewarded locations compared to unrewarded locations. These effects persisted {{for a short period}} of time after rewards were withdrawn before extinguishing quickly. However, these hemifield-specific effects failed to transfer to any secondary unrewarded eye movement task, but instead produced a more general effect of reward in one experiment conducted. The present set of experiments have established a reward paradigm able to consistently produce <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> when rewards are present; however these effects were found to be context and task-specific. The findings of the present set of experiments have highlighted the transient nature of the effects of reward and provide a framework for the future use of monetary rewards as a tool <b>for</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> The findings provided by the present set of experiments can be harnessed in future to guide the effectiveness of monetary reinforcers in a neuro-atypical population. ...|$|R
