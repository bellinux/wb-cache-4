2500|$|From 1859 until 1866, the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia had a red-yellow-blue Romanian tricolor, with {{horizontal}} stripes, {{as national}} flag. The flag was described properly in Almanahul român din 1866: [...] "a tricolor flag, divided in three stripes, red, yellow {{and blue and}} laid out horizontally: red above, blue below and yellow in the middle". Although the Ottoman Empire did not allow the United Principalities {{to have their own}} symbols, the new flag gained a degree of international recognition. Relating prince Cuza's May–June 1864 journey to Constantinople, doctor Carol Davila observed: [...] "The Romanian flag was raised on the great mast, the Sultan's kayaks awaited us, the guard was armed, the Grand Vizier at the door... The Prince, quiet, dignified, concise in his speech, spent 20 minutes with the Sultan, who then came to review us… Once again, the Grand Vizier led the Prince to the main gate and <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the Europe Palace, the Romanian flag still fluttering on the mast...".|$|E
2500|$|From the {{earliest}} days of Zionist settlement, Jewish immigrants wrote popular folk music. At first, songs were based on borrowed melodies from German, Russian, or traditional Jewish folk music with new lyrics written in Hebrew. Starting in the early 1920s, however, Jewish settlers made a conscious effort to create a new Hebrew style of music, a style that would tie them to their earliest Hebrew origins and that would differentiate them from the style of the Jewish diaspora of Eastern Europe, which they viewed as weak. This new style borrowed elements from Arabic and, to a lesser extent, traditional Yemenite and eastern Jewish styles: the songs were often homophonic (that is, without clear harmonic character), modal, and limited in range. [...] "The huge change in our lives demands new modes of expression," [...] wrote composer and music critic Menashe Ravina in 1943. [...] "... and, just as in our language <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> our historical past, so has our ear turned to the music of the east ... as an expression of our innermost feelings." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Wrestling with Zion," [...] {{he urged the}} Jews [...] "not to provoke the anger of the native people by doing them wrong...we should be {{cautious}} in our dealings with a foreign people among whom <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> live, to handle these people with love and respect and, needless to say, with justice and good judgment. [...] And what do our brothers do? [...] Exactly the opposite! [...] They were slaves in their Diasporas, and suddenly they find themselves with unlimited freedom, wild freedom that only a country like Turkey [...] can offer. [...] This sudden change has planted despotic tendencies in their hearts, as always happens to former slaves [...] [...] They deal with the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly, beat them shamefully for no sufficient reason, and even boast about their actions. [...] There is no one to stop the flood {{and put an end}} to this despicable and dangerous tendency. [...] Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage. [...] But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they are right to think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts. And these people will be revengeful like no other.|$|E
