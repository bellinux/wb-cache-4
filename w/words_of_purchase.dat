40|$|Thesis (MAcc (Accountancy)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{potential}} buyer {{of a business}} evaluates the attractiveness of the transaction by considering the financial status of the business being sold. In determining the financial status of a business {{it is more important}} to determine the nature of the assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet rather than the mere existence thereof. Included in the liabilities are accounting provisions recorded in terms of the Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to reflect a fair representation of the financial status. Although these provisions are made for accounting purposes, they cannot necessarily be deducted under the terms of the Income Tax Act, no 58 of 1962. The tax deductibility of accounting provisions has long been a potential contention when a business is sold. The Income Tax Act has specific sections that must be applied in determining the deductibility of accounting provisions, for example, section 11 (a), which is the general deduction formula; section 23 (g), which prohibits expenses not laid out for the purposes of trade; and section 23 (e), which does not allow a deduction when a reserve fund is created (for example a leave pay provision). In conducting this study, seven types of accounting provision generally recorded by businesses were identified: the bonus provision, leave pay provision, warranty provision, settlement discount and incentive-rebate provision, post employment provision, retrenchment cost provision and other provisions. These provisions are discussed in view of their possible income tax deductibility, and relevant case studies were identified to confirm the possible deductibility of these accounting provisions. In this study, the transfer of accounting provisions during the sale of a business is considered for the purposes of both the buyer and seller. The tax implications for the buyer and seller are then evaluated, as well as the subsequent treatment of the accounting provisions for the purposes of the buyer. Because the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>purchase</b> contract is extremely important when a business is acquired, three examples <b>of</b> the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> a <b>purchase</b> contract are discussed as well as the income tax implications thereof. The extent of the advice given by a tax practitioner will depend on the allegiance of the practitioner (either for the buyer or seller) and will determine how the contract will be concluded. In conclusion a tax practitioner would want to assist his client to obtain the most effective tax position for the transaction and therefore each purchase contract must be reviewed on its own set of facts...|$|R

Although existing social media research provides some valuable insights, it is relatively lacking in theory based research on the basic mechanisms through which desired brand goals are achieved. Value creation in online communities is a very crucial question that still needs further research. This study is an attempt to observe popular fan-pages' followers' activities of selected fan-pages of Malaysia and survey (n= 318) on followers of those fan-pages to show the impact of user's perceived online community value on their behavioral responses. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the impact of users' perceived community value on fan page engagement activities alongside the impact of fan-page engagement actions on fan-page loyalty. Besides, the impact of Fan-page loyalty on brand WOM (<b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Mouth) and <b>purchase</b> intention is also explored. Besides, the moderating impact of user's trust between the relationship of fan-page engagement and fan-page loyalty is also explored. The concepts of Diffusion of Innovation (DOl) theory is applied to create a unified model that was empirically validated by SEM analysis through AMOS. These findings have theoretical implications for social media and online interaction related literature as well as critical business implications for B 2 C (Business to Consumer) marketers to differentiate themselves within the inflating number of online platforms...|$|R

Prodajno okolje je eden najpomembnejših dejavnikov, ki vplivajo na njihovo počutje in zadovoljstvo. Treba je torej proučiti, kakšno naj bo prodajno okolje, ki bo porabnikom všečno in se bodo vedno z veseljem vračali vanjThe {{objective}} of every company {{is to maintain}} existing consumers and gain new ones. Key elements for achieving this objective are consumers’ satisfaction and loyalty. The sales environment {{is one of the}} most important factors that affect their well-being and satisfaction. It is therefore necessary to consider what kind of sales environment consumers prefer and are eager to return to. The theoretical part presents processes of perceiving a sales environment, which affect consumers before they enter a point of sale, and factors that affect them when they are already in a point of sale. Below we focus on the concept of satisfaction, and present models for measuring consumers’ satisfaction. In the conclusion of the theoretical part, we examine after-sales behaviour, which includes rumours, <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth, repeated <b>purchase,</b> consumer’s feedback, and loyalty. The primary purpose of the research is to verify hypotheses concerning the perception of factors in the environment, the importance of individual factors, satisfaction with individual factors, overall satisfaction with the sales environment, and the intention of after-sales behaviour...|$|R
