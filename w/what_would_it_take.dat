5000|$|In 2012, Stefaan Simons was {{appointed}} the inaugural Director of the International Energy Policy Institute, and the BHP Billiton Chair of Energy Policy. Simons {{has acknowledged that}} asking [...] "whether Australia could, and should, develop a nuclear power service industry based on uranium enrichment and fuel rod manufacture for the global market" [...] is a key theme of the Institute's work. In a 2013 article entitled Is it time for nuclear energy for Australia? Simons proposed that goals of securing energy supply, maintaining economic growth and mitigating impacts of climate change could all be advanced by including nuclear in a [...] "low-emission energy mix" [...] for Australia. On UCL's role in the process he wrote: [...] "University College London’s International Energy Policy Institute (IEPI), based at its Australia campus in Adelaide, undertakes economic, regulatory and policy research on how Australia could develop a nuclear energy industry and manage its externalities, including decommissioning and waste."In late 2013, UCL staff and students contributed to conference papers investigating the subject of nuclear submarine development in Australia. Papers entitled <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> for Australia to develop a nuclear-powered submarine capability? and From subs to Mines: <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> for Australia to develop a nuclear-powered submarine capability? were presented in Brisbane, Australia and at the AIChE Annual Meeting in San Francisco, USA respectively. The subject was further explored in 2014 with the presentation of a conference paper entitled Selecting Nuclear-Powered Submarines in Australia: Nuclear Waste Consideration at a Waste Management conference (WM2014) in Phoenix, Arizona.|$|E
