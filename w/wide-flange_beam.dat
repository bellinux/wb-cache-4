40|$|The {{purposes}} of the study are to build {{a model for the}} judgment criterion which corresponds to the probability of change occurring and to evaluate the judgment attitude of operators to this probability. The judgment criterion is defined by the equation which is called real ob-server. The experiment was conducted to see whether <b>wide-flange</b> <b>beams</b> were bent or warped. From this experiment, it was found {{that it is possible to}} derive a real-observer model which is generally applicable to the judgment criterion of operators. The judgment attitude of the op-erator is evaluated as follows: (1) He tries to look for defects rather than nondefects when the probability of defect occurring is slightly less than 0. 5, and (2) he tries to look for nondefects when the probability exceeds 0. 5...|$|R

5000|$|Compressive and {{tensile forces}} {{develop in the}} {{direction}} of the beam axis under bending loads. These forces induce stresses on the beam. The maximum compressive stress is found at the uppermost edge of the beam while the maximum tensile stress is located at the lower edge of the beam. Since the stresses between these two opposing [...] vary linearly, there therefore exists a point on the linear path between them where there is no bending stress. The locus of these points is the neutral axis. Because of this area with no stress and the adjacent areas with low stress, using uniform cross section beams in bending is not a particularly efficient means of supporting a load as it does not use the full capacity of the beam until it is on the brink of collapse. <b>Wide-flange</b> <b>beams</b> (-beams) and truss girders effectively address this inefficiency as they minimize the amount of material in this under-stressed region.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Two {{built-up}} <b>wide-flange</b> <b>beams</b> {{with several}} large holes in each beam were tested to failure. Strains were measured by strain gages at various levels, {{located at the}} ends and center of typical holes, and deflections were measured optically at two points on each beam. Lateral bracing was provided to prevent lateral-torsional buckling of the compression flange. The first beam, with a ratio of hole depth to beam depth of two-thirds, failed by buckling of a web post between adjacent holes. The second beam, with a ratio of hole depth to beam depth of four-fifths, deflected {{so much that the}} lateral bracing system failed and the beam failed by lateral buckling of the compression flange. No tearing of the web was observed, due to the rounding of the corners of the holes. The results of the beam tests correlated well with the Vierendeel theory in the elastic range of stresses, for holes at which there was a shear force. For holes at which there was no shear, the couple-plustee bending theory was somewhat more accurate. Bower's criteria for yielding of the beam section and his lower bound solution for the ultimate strength of the beams were investigated and compared with the loads at which yield actually occurred at each hole. The yield criteria were foundto be quite unconservative for these beams, but the predicted ultimate loads for holes with shear forces correlated well with the actual deflections and strains. The points of inflection in the tee sections did not appear to shift significantly from the centerlines of the holes, within the precision of the strain readings. Deflections were calculated as the sum of the simple beam deflection of the net beam section and deflection of the tee sections as fixed-end beams. The calculated values were 4...|$|R

40|$|With {{the demands}} of {{telecommunications}} and computer equipment, building owners and designers are facing an increasingly difficult problem for wire management in today's electronic workplace. This thesis is to investigate and design the accessible sunken floor systems for multi-story steel buildings with proliferating data cables and mechanical equipment. The terminology of an accessible sunken floor system or a dropped floor system is not new. Sunken floor {{has been used in}} reinforced concrete buildings with flat slabs and multi-story steel-framed construction with solid <b>wide-flange</b> <b>beams.</b> However, the design of an accessible sunken floor system with open-web steel joists and joist girders is an innovation, by leading steel design and construction industry into a new era. Sunken floors are sirniliar to raised floors, which are composed of removable square floor panels on metal pedestals to provide space for electrical or mechanical equipment or both. The removable panels provide easy access to the equipment below. These floors are commonly used in computer rooms, clean rooms and new office buildings which require extensive mechanical and electrical service. A clean room environment with air return through accessible plenums is essential in microelectronics and pharmaceutical facilities, in hospital operating rooms, in bio-genetic research laboratories and production areas, and in assembly plants for items such as computer disk drives and compact disks. Accessible sunken floor systems are used to avoid ramps or stairs as opposite to raised floor systems. Also, the finished floor-to-floor height in multi-story construction is less than the acceptable height for a raised floor, with subsequent savings on other more expensive building materials. Moreover, the construction cycle for steel buildings with open-web steel joists and joist girders is faster if the finished floor is composed of removable floor panels. One of the proposed systems is to substitute conventional concrete metal decks for fire-rated acoustical ceilings and horizontal bracings to cut down the construction cycle and costs. A second variation of the proposed systems permits economies in concrete slab finish by using lightweight concrete poured on corrugated metal decks, or by using pour- in -place or precast slabs below the finished floor panels, and the floor system is suspended 4 inches below the top chord of the steel joists as a horizontal diaphragm and fire barrier. This thesis will explore the building system integration and forecast the construction cycle and costs. An evaluation of the proposed systems will be presented with matrix diagrams to summarize the conclusion of this paper. by Henry K. Kwan. Thesis (S. M.)

The ratio of thecolumn height to the radius of gyration is about 24 and the moment of inertia of thebeam is equal to or 0. 45 times that of the column. Vertical loads are applied symmet-rically to the tops of the columns, being kept constant at about 18 % or 35 % of the yieldload of a column. The maximum horizontal load, applied at the tops of a frame, isfound to be nearly 10 - 15 % larger than that predicted by the elastic-perfectly plastictheory which takes account of the axial forces of the columns...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{different}} forms of <b>wide-flange,</b> thin-wall steel <b>beams</b> is becoming increasingly widespread. Part of the information necessary for a national design of such members is {{the knowledge of the}} stress distribution in and the equivalent width of the flanges of such beams. This problem is analyzed in this paper {{on the basis of the}} theory of plane stress. As a result, tables and curves are given from which the equivalent width of any given beam can be read directly for use in practical design. An investigation is given of the limitations of this analysis due to the fact that extremely wide and thin flanges tend to curve out of their plane toward the neutral axis. A summary of test data confirms very satisfactorily the analytical results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the residual behavior of <b>wide-flange</b> steel <b>beams</b> strengthened with high-modulus carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates subjected to thermal loading. Because the coefficients of thermal {{expansion of the}} steel and the CFRP are different, temperature-induced distress may take place along their interface. Periodic unbonded zones are considered to represent local interfacial damage. Five test categories are designed {{depending on the size}} of the unbonded zones from 10 to 50 mm, and corresponding beams are loaded until failure occurs after exposing to a cyclic temperature range of ΔT = 25 °C (− 10 to 15 °C) up to 84 days. The composite action between the CFRP and the steel substrate is preserved until yielding of the beams happens, regardless of the thermal cycling and periodic unbonded zones. The initiation and progression of CFRP debonding become apparent as the beams are further loaded, particularly at geometric discontinuities in the vicinity of the unbonded zones along the interface. A simple analytical model is employed to predict the interfacial stress of the strengthened beams. A threshold temperature difference of ΔT = 30 °C is estimated for the initiation and progression of CFRP debonding. Multiple debonding-progression stages in conjunction with the extent of thermal distress appear to exist. It is recommended that high-modulus CFRP be restrictively used for strengthening steel members potentially exposed to a wide temperature variation range...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wide-flange</b> steel <b>beams</b> {{were tested}} under unequal-end moments, {{in order to}} clarify the effects of bending moment {{gradient}} on the plastic rotation and maximum load carrying capacities of a beam. End moment ratio ρ (=M_ 2 /M_ 1, M_ 2, M_ 1 = bending moment {{at the ends of}} a specimen, |M_ 2 |＜|M_ 1 |) and lateral slenderness ratio ℓ_b/j_y (ℓ_b=laterally unbraced length, j_y=radius of gyration of a cross section about weak axis) were selected for the experimental variables. The test program concists of three series. For two of them with the value of ρ equal to 0 or - 0. 4, the values of ℓ_b/j_y are 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105. For another with the value of ρ equal to - 0. 8, the values of ℓ_b/j_y are 45, 75, and 105. Based on the experimental results, the applicability of the empirical formulas about plastic rotation capacities of beams (Ref. 12) were discussed. Furthermore the experimental maximum load carrying capacities were compared with allowable bending moment based on Ref. 14. The results may be summarized as follows : 1. The empirical formulas reported in Ref. l 2 {{can be applied to the}} region of ρ≤ 0, and experimental values (R_exp) and predicted values (R_pred) of plastic rotation satisfy the following equations [...] [the rest omitted...|$|R
