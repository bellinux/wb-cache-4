The effects of stitch density and <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> thickness were explored, and fibre compaction due to the stitching process was also verified. The results show that, in moderately stitched laminates (low stitch density), the improvement in GIIC was negligible. Crack bridging by the <b>stitch</b> <b>threads</b> at the crack zone were mostly compensated for the effect of fibre compaction, which reduced the GIIC values. Conversely, in densely stitched laminates (high stitch density), GIIC values were improved significantly (2 · 4 times {{higher than those of}} unstitched laminates). The effects of <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> thickness appeared to be negligible in moderately stitched laminates. For densely stitched laminates, thicker <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> (500 denier) possessed GIIC values that were 45 · 7 % higher than thinner <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> (200 denier) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{factors that}} {{influence}} in-plane mechanical responses and mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of stitched unidirectional sisal/epoxy laminates were studied in this paper. It was found that in-plane strength and stiffness of the laminates were not significantly affected by the <b>stitching</b> <b>threads,</b> while the interlaminar toughness was greatly improved, especially at higher sisal content. Unlike {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} composites, sisal laminates have a rather high tolerance against the damages induced by stitching process. In addition, stitching expanded the fiber bridging zone and determined the R-curve profiles of sisal laminates. Factors including stitching density, diameter and species of <b>stitching</b> <b>thread,</b> continuity of <b>stitching,</b> and modification methods of sisal, were proved to greatly influence the delamination resistance of the laminates...|$|R

40|$|The damage {{tolerance}} of composite laminates can be significantly improved {{by the addition}} of through-the-thickness fibrous reinforcement such as stitching. However, there are numerous stitching parameters which can be independently varied, and their separate and combined effects on mechanical properties need to be determined.

50|$|Stitching {{is arguably}} the {{simplest}} of the four main textile manufacturing techniques and {{one that can be}} performed with the smallest investment in specialized machinery. Basically stitching consists of inserting a needle, carrying the <b>stitch</b> <b>thread,</b> through a stack of fabric layers to form a 3D structure. The advantages of stitching are {{that it is possible to}} stitch both dry and prepreg fabric, although the tackiness of the prepreg makes the process difficult and generally creates more damage within the prepreg material than in the dry fabric. Stitching also utilizes the standard two-dimensional fabrics that are commonly in use within the composite industry therefore there is a sense of familiarity concerning the material systems. The use of standard fabric also allows a greater degree of flexibility in the fabric lay-up of the component than is possible with the other textile processes, which have restrictions on the fibre orientations that can be produced.|$|R

(Dorothea Hall, 1999) It had been applied in various textiles products such as pillow, costume and curtain from Middle Ages to present. Smocking commonly uses in cuffs, bodices, neckline and waistline in costume. In these decades, smocking has been transformed from costume and living goods to fashion and art pieces. It is commonly found in high-street fashion collections and, even, used as a media by many modern textiles artists for expressing concept and ideas as well. Those textiles artists developed their own interpretations of conventional smocking stitches to secure folds and create aesthetic effect. Smocking varies in combination of pattern, <b>stitches,</b> <b>threading</b> and fabric. This paper aimed to explore more possibilities through developing contemporary smocking by combining innovative techniques and materials. It may also provide a reference for designers who would like to explore the possible application of contemporary smocking to garments or textiles. 1...|$|R
40|$|Stitch fiber {{comparison}} {{for improvement}} of interlaminar fracture toughness in stitched composites KT Tan 1, N Watanabe 1 and Y Iwahori 2 In this study, strain energy release rates are measured and compared for laminated composites reinforced by through-thickness stitching using different stitch fiber materials – Carbon, Kevlar, and Vectran. Strain energy release rates are evaluated experimentally using the DCB test and validated computationally using FEA. The FE model of the stitched composite incorporates a novel four-step stitch fracture process, namely: interfacial debonding, slack absorption, fiber breakage, and pull-out friction. The FE predictions of GIC show good agreement with the experimental results.

An FE model based on the use of progressive damage schemes for modelling intralaminarand interlaminar damage and accounting for the bridging action of <b>stitching</b> <b>threads</b> was developed in the study. Individual stitches were modelled by solid elements inserted along the thickness of the laminate and connected to the adjacent layer elements through cohesive interface elements.

The numerical results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations in terms of force histories, force-deflection curves and internal damage induced by impact. In particular, the proposed model was able to correctly predict the effect of stitching on the damage response of the laminates at different impact energies and to capture the influence of the layup on the efficiency of stitching for improving the delamination resistance of the laminated sample...|$|R
