5|$|Today, the {{majority}} of all subway delays are caused by signal problems. Whenever a track circuit stops working, all of the signals which are affected by it turn red, as it is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> train in that section, and the system properly reverts to a safe state.|$|E
5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Hemlock Hoax {{was based on}} a minor character from a film story that had been rejected. The finished film was released in April as a split reel, being presented with two other Lubin comedies. The black-and-white short received positive reviews with several journalists praising the film's humor. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> surviving print of the film, and the identities of the film's cast and crew are not recorded.|$|E
50|$|According to Ware, the {{question}} <b>is</b> not <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> plan for invasion, but <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> decision to implement it, which would presumably require presidential authorization.|$|R

5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA {{is partly due to}} a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark is oviparous. Males have larger teeth than females, {{with which}} to bite and hold onto them for copulation. <b>Whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{specific}} mating season is uncertain, though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts, ovulating a single egg into each at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June, and once every 30 days {{the rest of the}} year. The second egg in a pair is deposited 1224 hours after the first.|$|E
5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reasonable nexus between the state action taken and {{the object of the}} law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
30|$|The {{integration}} order one, {{denoted by}} I(1), {{is one of}} the conditions to apply ARDL model so since we identified the variable order, we were able to examine <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long-run relationship based on the Johansen cointegration test. Once we carried out the test, we were able to see <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> short-run relationship.|$|R

5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> national security issue involved.|$|E
