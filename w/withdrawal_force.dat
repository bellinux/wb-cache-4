40|$|Background. Spinal catheters, {{because of}} their smaller diameter, have lower tensile {{strength}} than epidural catheters. This {{study was designed to}} measure the withdrawal forces needed to remove lumbar spinal catheters and to determine whether patient position affects withdrawal forces. Methods. Eighty-two patients with a 24 -gauge spinal catheter placed midline at the lumbar L 3 / 4 or L 4 / 5 level were randomly assigned to catheter removal either in flexed lateral or sitting position. Withdrawal forces were measured using a tension spring balance. Results. Mean <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> was 0. 91 N (95 % CI: 0. 73, 1. 09) with extremes up to 5 N. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> in the flexed lateral position was 1. 04 N (95 % CI: 0. 73, 1. 34) or in the sitting position was 0. 78 N (95 % CI: 0. 59, 0. 97). The 95 % CI for the difference of the means was 20. 62 N, 0. 10 N. Thus, the absolute mean difference between the positions can be assumed to be smaller than 0. 62 N.

30|$|Glued {{mortise and tenon}} joints {{are often}} used in joints for {{furniture}} such as chairs. However, such joints are not sufficiently resistant to withdrawal forces {{because of the difficulty}} of applying a clamping pressure to the surfaces being glued. Therefore, some reinforcement, {{such as the use of}} dowel-type fasteners, is necessary. In this study, we discussed the applicability of the shrink-fit method used in green woodworking to strengthen glued round mortise and tenon joints. The test specimens were assembled using wet mortise members and air-dried tenon members with polyvinyl acetate resin emulsion adhesive. Withdrawal tests on joint specimens of four hardwood species were conducted to study the reinforcing effects of the shrink fit on the withdrawal performance of the mortise and tenon joints. The proposed shrink-fitted glued round mortise and tenon joint exhibited sufficient withdrawal strength equivalent to that of the joint glued with epoxy resin adhesive. After applying four humidity cycles to simulate seasonal variations in moisture content, withdrawal strength did not decrease significantly. The proposed joint could withstand the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> to some extent after adhesion was fractured by shear force.|$|E

Particleboard screws of the 5 mm in diameter were inserted in {{the edge of the}} board. Pilot hole diameters were 2, 5 mm and 3, 0 mm and the depth of embedment was 30 mm for all tests. The chosen PVAc adhesive (type 3) with the addition of wood flour as consolidator in the range from 3 - 10 % was inserted into pilot-hole. Tests were also obtained after consequent reassembly of the screw connection in order to examine the ratio of loss in withdrawal forces in such case.

40|$|Although {{a variety}} of {{fundamental}} mechanical properties of graphene have been investigated, the nature of interactions between graphene and other materials is not yet fully understood. Here, we report on adhesive interactions between diamond indenters and monolayer, bilayer and trilayer graphene on silicon oxide as well as bare silicon oxide and graphite over relatively small spatial domains. Displacement-controlled nanoindentation with an ultralow noise force sensor allowed the complete adhesive responses to be observed without the usual instabilities associated with nanoindenters that operate in force control. It {{was found that the}} approach and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> profiles between diamond and graphene depended on the number of layers of graphene. The unloading response contained very characteristic features, which were attributed to separation between graphene and silicon oxide in subsequent stress analyses of the experiments. The numerical stress analyses accounted for the interactions between the probe and the graphene as well as between graphene and silicon oxide via traction-separation relations which included attractive and repulsive interactions. As a result, it was possible to extract the energy, strength and range of the interactions for all cases, thereby providing a much richer measure of the interactions than relying solely on force profiles. clos...|$|E

Breeder blanket materials have to produce tritium from lithium while fulfilling several strict conditions. In particular, when dealing with materials to be applied in fusion reactors, one of the key questions is the study of light ions retention, which can be produced by transmutation reactions and/or introduced by interaction with the plasma. In ceramic breeders the understanding of the hydrogen isotopes behaviour and specially the diffusion of tritium to the surface is crucial. Moreover the evolution of the microstructure during irradiation with energetic ions, neutrons and electrons is complex because of the interaction of a high number of processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) and carprofen (CP) on postoperative incisional pain using the plantar incision (PI) model in rats. A 1 -cm longitudinal incision was made through skin, fascia and muscles of a hind paw of male Wistar rats and the development of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity was determined over 4 days using the von Frey and Hargreaves methods, respectively. Based on the experimental treatments received on the third postoperative day, the animals were divided into the following groups: PI+CP (CP, 2 mg/kg, po); PI+EAST 36 (100 -Hz EA applied bilaterally at the Zusanli point (ST 36)); PI+EANP (EA applied to a non-acupoint region); PI+IMMO (immobilization only); PI (vehicle). In the von Frey test, the PI+EAST 36 group had higher <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> thresholds in response to mechanical stimuli than the PI, PI+IMMO and PI+EANP groups at several times studied. Furthermore, the PI+EAST 36 group showed paw withdrawal thresholds in response to mechanical stimuli that were similar to those of the PI+CP group. In the Hargreaves test, all groups had latencies higher than those observed with PI. The PI+EAST 36 group was similar to the PI+IMMO, PI+EANP and PI+CP groups. We conclude that 100 -Hz EA at the ST 36 point, but not at non-acupoints, can reduce mechanical nociception in the rat model of incisional pain, and its effectiveness is comparable to that of carprofen...|$|E

Supplementing the diet with probiotics in order to recolonize the GI tract is known to have proven health benefits that may reduce disease and/or promote good health. This study examined the acceptability of chocolate no-bake cookies fortified with a daily dose of probiotics (as recommended by the manufacturer, Neutraceutical Corporation, Park City, Utah). Central Washington University Dining Service’s chocolate no-bake cookie recipe was used as the control and the test cookie was fortified with 45 g of probiotic powder. Therefore, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, consuming a single serving of cookies would result in a daily dose of probiotics. Statistical analysis of data from an extended duo-trio test for sensory attributes, obtained from a panel of 30 untrained judges, revealed that no significant difference could be detected between the two cookies. Preference ratings based on overall look, feel, aroma, and taste on a 9 -point hedonic scale showed both cookies were well liked.

40|$|The {{number one}} {{cause of death}} in America is {{cardiovascular}} disease. To combat this, individuals can consume food products to increase their fiber intake to the recommended 25 grams per day. If a product contains at least 2. 5 grams of fiber per serving, a company can claim that it is a good source of fiber. This experiment, conducted in February of 2015, aimed to increase fiber consumption by creating a good-source-of-fiber muffin without altering the taste. To do this, part of the whole wheat and all-purpose flour in the recipe were replaced with one of three International Fiber Corporation fiber powders. The powders used were White Wheat Fiber (WWF), Powdered Cellulose (FFC), and Cotton Seed (BVF). No significant differences, p 3 ̆c 0. 05, were subjectively determined between any of the three fibers compared to the control, BVF: n= 32, WWF: n= 32, FFC: n= 60. Objective testing, p 3 ̆e 0. 05, n= 18 for all tests/muffin types, showed a significant difference in mean penetration force between the control muffins compared to all three variable muffin types. Adding white whole wheat fiber and cotton seed fiber resulted in a softer muffin than the control, while powdered cellulose resulted in a harder muffin. There were no significant differences, p 3 ̆c 0. 05, n= 18 for all tests/muffin types, in percent moisture content and mean <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> between the variable muffins and the control muffins.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{integrity}} of the roof system is essential for ensuring the safety of inhabitants and preventing excessive damage to light-frame wood structures. The uplift capacity of fastened roof panels has been investigated using experimental tests and numerical models, where monotonic uniform static pressures are often applied to the roof panel models. The verification is needed for the adequacy of using static uniformly distributed pressure representing the wind load. Moreover, the uncertainty of nail withdrawal behaviour has not been included in existing numerical models, and the effect due to construction errors has not been addressed rationally. A nonlinear Finite Element model is developed in this study to incorporate the nail withdrawal uncertainty in terms of maximum <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force,</b> initial stiffness, proportional limit, and the displacement at maximum force of the nail withdrawal behaviour. This model is used to investigate the statistical characteristics of the panel uplift capacity. The effect of spatial varying wind load is discussed by using the pressure coefficient obtained from wind tunnel model test at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel at the University of Western Ontario. Furthermore, the impact of construction error is investigated, in terms of missing nail effects, with first-hand survey information. The detailed survey was carried out at the IRLBH (The Insurance Research Lab for Better Homes) facility to inspect the quality of construction, specifically for the statistical information of missing nails on roof panels. Finally, the evaluated statistical characterization of panel uplift capacity {{is used for the}} reliability analysis of a typical panel considering or ignoring the missing nail effects. Both code specified pressure-gust coefficient from NBCC (2005) and the peak pressure coefficients obtained from wind tunnel test are used. Results suggested that the nonlinear pushover analysis using the proposed nonlinear Finite Element model is adequate for estimating the panel uplift capacity. A more stringent fastening schedule with a spacing of 150 mm for the edges and intermediate supports is suggested for the construction of light frame wood houses...|$|E

In the review article by Kopsky and Stahl, four critical barriers in the process of research and development of topical analgesics were indicated. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the formulation are among the major challenges. The road to {{the development}} of such drugs passes through preclinical studies. These studies, if planned correctly, should serve as guidance for choosing the right API and formulation. Although rodent models for pain continue to provide valuable data on the mechanisms driving pain, their use in developing topical and localized treatment approaches is limited for technical (intraplate injection area is small) as well as mechanical reasons (non-similarity to human skin and innervation). It has been previously shown that pigs are comparable to humans in ways that make them a better choice for evaluating topical and local analgesics. The aim {{of this study was to}} summarize several experiments that used pigs for testing postoperative pain in an incisional pain model (skin incision [SI] and skin and muscle incision [SMI]). At the end of the surgery, the animals were treated with different doses of bupivacaine solution (Marcaine®), bupivacaine liposomal formulation (Exparel®) or ropivacaine solution (Naropin). Von Frey testing demonstrated a decrease in the animals’ sensitivity to mechanical stimulation expressed as an increase in the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> following local treatment. These changes reflect the clinical condition in the level as well as in the duration of the response. These data indicate a good resemblance between pig and human skin and suggest that use of these animals in the preclinical phase of developing topical analgesics can, to some extent, release the bottleneck.
