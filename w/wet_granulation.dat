The drug-release kinetics from the two types of pellets was studied using three dissolution apparatuses: paddle apparatus, reciprocating cylinder, and flow-through cell. The paper compared the three dissolution methods and considered the effect of the granulation process on the ibuprofen-release kinetics. Dissolution data were analyzed using the Weibull function as well as the difference (f 1) and similarity (f 2) factors. Dissolution kinetics was not influenced by the granulation process, regardless of the dissolution apparatus and of the drug content. The comparison of the three dissolution devices indicated that ibuprofen was released faster from granules loaded with 36 % of drug content with the reciprocating apparatus, due to the disintegration of the granules occurring during the dissolution test. For the other drug contents, dissolution profiles were not significantly different from one apparatus to another.

50|$|In {{the tablet}} {{pressing}} process, the main guideline {{is to ensure}} that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is in each tablet. Hence, all the ingredients should be well-mixed. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet.

The cyclodextrins have been widely applied in pharmaceutical technology {{with the objective of}} increasing the solubility, stability and bioavailability of drugs in different pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as tablets. In order to obtain beta-CD tablets, liquid dispersions of drug/beta-CD are usually submitted to different drying processes, like spray-drying, freeze-drying or slow evaporation, being this dry material added to a number of excipients. However, such drying processes can generate particulate materials showing problems of flow and compressibility, needing their conversion into granulates by means of <b>wetting</b> with <b>granulation</b> liquid followed by additional drying. In this work, the main objective was to evaluate the preparation of tablets without the need of this additional drying step. For this purpose an aqueous dispersion containing acetaminophen/beta-CD complex and cornstarch was dried using a spouted bed and the obtained granules were compressed in tablets. Acetaminophen was used as model drug due to its low water solubility and the inexpensive and widely available cornstarch was chosen as excipient. Acetaminophen powder was added into a beta-cyclodextrin solution prepared in distilled water at 70 degrees C. Stirring was kept until this dispersion cooled to room temperature. Then cornstarch was added and the resulting dispersion was dried in spouted bed equipment. This material was compressed into tablets using an Erweka Korsh EKO tablet machine. This innovative approach allowed the tablets preparation process to be carried out with fewer steps and represents a technological reliable strategy to produce beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes tablets.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of tablet is often overlooked. A simple compressed mass of active and inactive ingredients hides the complex relationship between achieving the desired drug potency, the tablet {{strength and the}} tablet dissolution. The resulting tablet properties, particularly the tablet strength, are driven by the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process, an up-stream particle size enlargement process. Studies {{on the influence of}} the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process on the tablet properties show that there is still confusion over the influence of the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> on the final tablet strength {{due to the lack of}} investigation in the direct impact between <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> and tabletting, which paves the path for the objective of this thesis. The influence of the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process on the final tablet strength was investigated by conducting <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> case studies looking at the effects of the liquid level, wet massing time, impeller speed and binder flow rate on a standard formulation of 1 : 1 lactose and microcrystalline cellulose granulated with polyvinyl pyrrolidine polymer in various solutions. A model called the “Unified Compaction Curve” was adopted from the dry roller compaction process and applied to the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> case studies to see the feasibility of the model and understand how the model bridges the relationship between the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> operating conditions and the final tablet strength. To understand this, granules from selected granulation batches were analysed to determine the granule properties including the circularity factor, surface roughness and granule porosity. The effect of the wet massing process, presence of moisture, liquid binder acidity and the presence of hydrogen-bonding in the granule liquid bridges on the microcrystalline cellulose properties was also investigated. The Unified Compaction Curve model was also extended to investigate the effect of the granulator scale on the final tablet strength to explore the possibility of a new up-scale guideline. The results demonstrate that the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process can have a direct effect on the subsequent tablet strength. As the liquid level, wet massing time and impeller speed increases, the tablet strength decreases from a maximum tablet hardness of approximately 45 kp (from direct compaction) to lowest tablet hardness of 23. 5 kp after 10 minutes of wet massing time. Therefore there is a “loss of compactability” when the formulation is exposed to processing conditions in <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> and even in dry roller compaction (Kochhar et al., 1995; Bultmann, 2002; Freitag and Kleinebudde, 2003; Shi et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2011). The loss of compactability in the formulation by the processing compaction forces sets up the fundamental conditions for the Unified Compaction Curve model to be applied. The Unified Compaction Curve model was found to be a feasible model for the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process in which the model was able to translate the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> compaction curves for various liquid levels, wet massing times, impeller speeds and binder flow rates and overlap them onto the master direction compaction curve, which allows the prediction of the resulting tablet strength. The Unified Compaction Curve is able to quantify the amount of compaction pressure exerted on the granules during <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> through the “effective <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> compaction pressure”, PWGC. When the PWGC is coupled with the cumulative number of impeller revolutions, the liquid level, wet massing time, impeller speed and binder flow-rate <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> data all coincide onto a first-order exponential curve. This makes the Unified Compaction Curve a potentially powerful tool in visually seeing the magnitude of deterioration in the tablet strength by the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process, which allows the prediction of the final tablet strength. The deterioration in the tablet strength with increasing <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> processing time is attributed to the decrease in the granule surface and rounding of the granule structure. This was evident by the increase in the circularity factor with increasing number of impeller revolutions and SEM images. The granulator impeller consolidates the granules, consequently destroying the granule surface roughness and decreases the granule porosity. If the granule porosity is seen as a function of the cumulative number of impeller revolutions, it can be seen that the relationship is the inverse relationship of the PWGC and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. This demonstrates that the granule porosity is one of the main driving factors for the deterioration of the tablet strength with increasing residence time in the granulator. The transition of the granule morphology and porosity during <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> can be attributed to the irreversible plastic deformation of microcrystalline cellulose particles, which wrap and encase the lactose particles during the consolidation and densification of the granules during the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process. This destroys the mechanical inter-locking ability of the granules during the tabletting process, hence leading to the “loss of compactability” and reduction in the final tablet strength. However, the Unified Compaction Curve model will only be valid for granulation formulations comprising at least 30 % liquid level and with at least 50 % microcrystalline cellulose in the formulation used in this study, to effectively translate the kinetic forces from the impeller into compaction forces for significant deformation to occur. This was evident in granulation case studies where a liquid level less than 30 % leads to the compaction data not conforming to the Unified Compaction Curve model. A recent study into the Unified Compaction Curve model found that a formulation comprising of 49 % of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel Ph- 101) was not successful for the model to be valid (Dave and Dudhat, 2013). Investigations into the presence or absence of intra-granular hydrogen bonding in the granule liquid bridges can influence the final tablet. When hydrogen bonding is present (by using water-based liquid binder) between the granules, the granule strength increases which in turn compromises the table strength. The inverse trend was found for the absence of hydrogen-bonding (by using an ethanol-based liquid binder). Therefore strength of the liquid bridges can play a part in controlling the final tablet strength. The exploration of the effect of the liquid binder on the microcrystalline cellulose properties revealed that microcrystalline cellulose swells upon exposure to liquid binder. The swelling of the cellulose would increase the bonding area and confer strength to the tablet. The acidity of the liquid binder appears to influence the crystallite size of microcrystalline cellulose granules. The crystallite size was found to be larger for granulation experiments using a liquid binder with a neutral pH level (such as calcium oxide liquid binders), compared to the crystallite size in granules produced with more acidic liquid binders (such as PVP or hydrochloric acid). The wet massing time did not have any significant effect on the crystalline or amorphous regions of microcrystalline cellulose. The effects of the wet granulator scale was also investigated which revealed that Unified Compaction Curve demonstrates different mixing intensities between the 1 litre and 5 litre granulator bowls in the relationship between the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> compaction pressure (denoted as χ) and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. The compaction pressure per revolution was found to be greater for the 1 L granulator in comparison to the 5 L granulator scale. This formed the basis for the proposal of a new <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> scale-up rule which looks at maintaining ‘constant compaction pressure’ during the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> scale-up process. This scale-up rule is a function of the compaction pressure per revolution and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. The compaction pressure per revolution, χ, is able to compensate for the differences in the granulator bowl geometry and impeller design between the two granulator scales. The proposed rule is anticipated to be a useful tool to help maintain constant granule properties during <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> scale-up but also to target the desired tablet. The studies in this thesis will allow a deeper insight into the mechanisms in the relationship between the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> process and the final tablet strength, which would enable the <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> to be tailored for optimisation and target tablet specifications, make trouble-shooting easier to carry out and reduce resources for <b>wet</b> <b>granulation</b> case studies. This is of great importance and benefit to the pharmaceutical industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the wound healing potential of crude aqueous extract of Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) Bertoni, Asteraceae, in experimental animals. All experiments were conducted following standard procedures. The crude extract was administered topically in graded doses of 150, 250 and 500 mg/kg b. w. was used for evaluating the wound healing potential in excision wound model for fourteen days and orally in the incision wound model for ten days, respectively. Povidone iodine ointment was used as standard (5. 0 % w/w). Dose dependent activities resulted in both the wound models {{when compared to the}} standard (povidone iodine) and the control. Topical application of crude aqueous extract of S. rebaudiana (500 mg/kg b. w) in excision wound model decreased significantly the wound area by 15 th day, i. e. 48. 2 ± 2. 0 compared with control 94. 1 ± 1. 2. Epithelization time was decreased from 17. 3 ± 0. 21 to 12. 0 ± 0. 10 and hydroxylproline content was increased from 32. 2 ± 0. 11 to 67. 6 ± 0. 10 when compared with control. In incision wound model breaking strength of wounds, <b>wet</b> and dry <b>granulation</b> of the tissue weight and hydroxyproline were increased significantly from control with AESR. In conclusion, AESR leaves accelerated wound healing activity in mice and thus supports its traditional use...|$|R
40|$|High shear {{granulation}} is {{an important}} process {{in a wide variety}} of applications, more specifically in pharmaceutical industries as a basic step in the tableting process. The process includes two major steps: dry high shear <b>granulation</b> and <b>wet</b> high shear <b>granulation.</b> It aims at producing granules with a specific size and material composition. The quality of the process is determined by the flow regime. Therefore, a better understanding of the flow regime is required. Computational simulation of such systems is traditionally performed by tracking each particle and resolving its binary collision and interaction with other particles. This approach is not feasible for industrial granulators with billions of particles. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possibility of applying various continuum modeling options in studying dense or multi-regime granular flows. Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow formulates the dilute parts of the system, whereas there is no strong agreement on any approach to modeling dense granular flows. In this study, a recent model proposed by Jop et al. is applied as an alternative to the model by Schaeffer, traditionally used for such flow regimes. The results show that the present model is not only simple, but also clearly predictive. Besides, considering the simplicity of the model compared to its alternatives (KTGF or DEM), adding more details to develop the model can be performed with fewer obstacles. In order to validate the model proposed in this study, model results are compared with experiments performed in a disc impeller granulator. The experimental results were analyzed using advanced techniques including a high speed camera and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Keywords: high shear granulation, continuum modeling, rheology, disc impelle...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Diabetes is {{a chronic}} {{hyperglycemic}} metabolic disorder; leads to generates many complications including delay in wound healing after any injury. These non healing wound ends upto organ or limb salvage. The available modern allopathic medications {{are not able}} to full control over these complications. There are several evidences that complication associated with diabetes can easily be treated by using herbal or folklore medicines. The leaves of Cinnamomum tamala used by traditional peoples in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and associated wound healing problems. The aim of our study was to find the active extract from various extracts of C. tamala leaves responcible for wound healing activity in diabetic rats. Methods: The wistar albino rats were made diabetic by single i. p. injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). The excision, incision and dead space wound were created on back side of rats. The ethanolic extract of C. tamala leaves was applied topically in excision wound model while in incision and dead space wound model the ethanolic extract of C. tamala leaves (100 mg/kg) was give orally for 16 days. Results: In the excision wound model the wound area and day of epithelization both were significantly decreased in ethanolic extract of C. tamala leaves treated rats. In incision wound model the significantly higher tensile strength was observed in rats treaded orally with ethanolic extract treated. There were significant increase in weight of <b>wet</b> & dry <b>granulation</b> tissue with increased amount of hydroxyproline, collagen and elastin was observed in treated rats by ethanolic extract of C. tamala leaves Conclusion: The results suggested that the ethanolic extract of leaves of Cinnamomum tamala can be used in treatment of dalayed wound healing in diabetic rats...|$|R
