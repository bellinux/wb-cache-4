5|$|The <b>white-naped</b> <b>xenopsaris</b> was {{described}} in 1869 by the German-Argentine scientist Hermann Burmeister, based on a specimen collected near Buenos Aires. Burmeister originally placed it in the becard genus, Pachyramphus. It {{was moved to the}} monotypic genus Xenopsaris by Robert Ridgway in 1891, but was still known to be closely related to Pachyramphus. A 1989 study of anatomy identified Pachyramphus as a sister taxon to Xenopsaris, but the <b>white-naped</b> <b>xenopsaris</b> was kept in its own genus due to several morphological and behavioural differences, namely its smaller size, the shape of its legs, the length of its primary flight feathers, the lack of strong sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes) and the construction of the nest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>white-naped</b> <b>xenopsaris</b> has a disjunct distribution. The {{southern}} {{population of}} the nominate subspecies is widespread from north-eastern Brazil through to Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina and Uruguay. A separate {{population of the}} nominate is found in Guyana. The subspecies X.a.minor is found in west and central Venezuela, and probably extends into north-eastern Colombia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>white-naped</b> <b>xenopsaris</b> (Xenopsaris albinucha), {{also known}} as the reed becard and white-naped becard, is a species of suboscine bird in the family Tityridae, {{the only member of the}} genus Xenopsaris. It is found in South America, in humid {{subtropical}} and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae.|$|E

500|$|The <b>white-naped</b> <b>xenopsaris</b> {{feeds on}} insects, but no studies have yet {{been done on}} the diet of adults. Chicks in the nest are fed {{grasshoppers}} from the family Acrididae, mantidflies, praying mantises and mosquitoes. Adults typically hunt singly or sometimes in pairs, and breeding pairs can often be observed hunting well apart from each other. They are shy, generally quiet and inconspicuous. They typically hunt from a perch on {{the outer edge of}} the foliage of trees, watching for prey and then launching themselves [...] to snatch prey off leaves. They also strike from a hovering position above foliage, and may chase prey acrobatically for some distance. They often feed near the ground and sometimes take prey from the ground as well as from vegetation.|$|E
