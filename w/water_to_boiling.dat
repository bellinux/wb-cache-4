Encysted protozoan pathogens may require higher temperatures to remove any risk.|$|E
40|$|Haiti is {{the poorest}} {{country in the}} Western {{hemisphere}} and {{is in need of}} cheap cooking fuel source. Currently, lump charcoal, the cooking fuel of Haiti, is made by carbonizing trees in ditches before selling the charcoal at market. However, Haiti is now 98 % deforested and {{must find a way to}} prepare their food that does not destroy their land. The idea for this new fuel comes from compressed and extruded carbonized bagasse, which was produced using an extruder developed in a senior product development class at MIT. Using this bagasse fuel, experiments were conducted to compare the combustion characteristics of the bagasse charcoals with wood charcoal. Unfortunately, the heat released by the bagasse charcoal did not compare favorably with that of the wood charcoal, failing to raise 1 L of <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> while the wood charcoal raised the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> for 25 minutes. Since the bagasse charcoal performed similarly to Kingsford brand charcoal, the emissions released were compared between these two fuels. Based on their averages, the bagasse charcoal emitted 1. 4 times more CO, 1. 6 times more SO₂ and 2. 3 times more particulates but only 17 % of the NOx emitted by Kingsford. by Andrés Ramírez.

40|$|Ohmori et al. (1), then Mizuno et al. (2, 3) {{showed in}} high voltage-high current {{electrolysis}} experiments {{the production of}} excess heat and abnormal production of hydrogen. Cirillo et al. (4) have shown transmutation of elements on the tungsten cathode during similar types of plasma electrolysis. Also, Fauvarque et al. (5) have shown the production of excess heat. All these experiments have been performed with light water at boiling temperature i. e. 100 °C and atmospheric pressure. We have developed a new calorimeter that can operate at higher temperatures and higher pressures. The cell is of cylindrical shape made of Teflon 10 cm in diameter and 21 cm high. The cell is positioned on a balance {{in order to measure}} continuously the weight loss of the cell during operation. The tungsten cathode of various diameters is located {{at the center of the}} cell, and the anode is a stainless steel foil surrounding the cathode. A mechanical pressure gauge permits the measurement of the pressure of the cell. The temperature is calculated from the pressure temperature boiling curve. A calibrated relief valve keeps the pressure constant in the cell. The electrical input power is measured by a high-speed wattmeter, and the heat produced is calculated from the weight loss of the cell. The cell is also equipped with a resistor for calibration of the system, and heating the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> prior to the start of the electrolysis.

50|$|Steam can {{be drawn}} off as required, either for driving a steam turbine or for process {{purposes}} (e.g. in chemical engineering), by opening a steam valve {{on top of the}} drum.

50|$|Vacuum {{evaporation}} is {{the process}} of causing the pressure in a liquid-filled container to be reduced below the vapor pressure of the liquid, causing the liquid to evaporate at a lower temperature than normal.
