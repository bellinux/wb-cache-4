25|$|In the film, Abraham Lincoln {{is portrayed}} in a {{positive}} light due to his belief in conciliatory postwar policies towards southern whites. The president's views are directly contrasted by Austin Stonewall, a character shown in a negative light who acts as an antagonist. The assassination of Lincoln leads to the effective transition between the war and reconstruction, both of which are represented by the two acts of the film. In including the assassination, the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis. Franklin wrote the film's depiction of Reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok, raping and killing whites with impunity until the Klan stepped in is not supported by the facts. Franklin wrote that most freed slaves continued to work for their former masters in Reconstruction for the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> alternative, and though relations between freedmen and their former masters were not friendly, very few freedmen sought revenge against the people who had held them in chains. The character of Silas Lynch has no basis in fact, and during the Reconstruction no black or mulatto men served as the lieutenant governor of South Carolina.|$|E

Also in May, details were shared on a three issue tie-in series titled Civil War II: Ulysses from writer Al Ewing and artist Jefte Palo. The series focuses on Ulysses, the new Inhuman {{with the power}} to predict the future at the center of [...] "Civil War II". Ewing described the series as [...] "a prequel of sorts", explaining, [...] "we're following Ulysses as he's taken to the Tower of Wisdom -- a sort of Inhuman temple of learning, for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> term -- to be trained by Karnak, whose Inhuman ability is to see the flaw in all things. Karnak's training methods might be more than Ulysses can handle, though." [...] The next month, Alonso said [...] "Civil War II" [...] would set a new status quo in the Marvel Universe, which would be presented in the [...] "Divided We Stand" [...] storyline as part of the company's 2016 Marvel NOW! relaunch.|$|E
60|$|At present, man {{applies to}} nature but half his force. He {{works on the}} world with his {{understanding}} alone. He lives in it, and masters it by a penny-wisdom; and he that works most in it, is but a half-man, and whilst his arms are strong and his digestion good, his mind is imbruted, {{and he is a}} selfish savage. His relation to nature, his power over it, is through the understanding; as by manure; the economic use of fire, wind, water, and the mariner's needle; steam, coal, chemical agriculture; the repairs of the human body by the dentist and the surgeon. This is such <b>a</b> resumption <b>of</b> power, as if a banished king should buy his territories inch by inch, instead of vaulting at once into his throne. Meantime, in the thick darkness, there are not <b>wanting</b> gleams <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> light,--occasional examples <b>of</b> the action of man upon nature with his entire force,--with reason as well as understanding. Such examples are; the traditions of miracles in the earliest antiquity of all nations; the history of Jesus Christ; the achievements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> principle, as in religious and political revolutions, and in the abolition of the Slave-trade; the miracles of enthusiasm, as those reported of Swedenborg, Hohenlohe, and the Shakers; many obscure and yet contested facts, now arranged under the name of Animal Magnetism; prayer; eloquence; self-healing; and the wisdom of children. These are examples of Reason's momentary grasp of the sceptre; the exertions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> power which exists not in time or space, but an instantaneous in-streaming causing power. The difference between the actual and the ideal force of man is happily figured by the schoolmen, in saying, that the knowledge <b>of</b> man is <b>an</b> evening knowledge, vespertina cognitio, but that <b>of</b> God is <b>a</b> morning knowledge, matutina cognitio.|$|R

2500|$|Several {{sources have}} {{referred}} to the Bogdanov affair as a [...] "reverse Sokal" [...] hoax, drawing a comparison with the Sokal affair, where the physicist Alan Sokal published a deliberately fraudulent and indeed nonsensical article in the humanities journal Social Text.

Worried by this [...] "more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment", Sokal decided to perform an experiment which he later cheerfully admitted was both unorthodox and uncontrolled, provoking a maelstrom of reactions which, to his surprise, received coverage in Le Monde and even the front page of The New York Times. The physicist John Baez drew a comparison between the two events in his October 2002 post to the sci.physics.research newsgroup.|$|E

After some historical notes on the first attempts for the numerical evaluation of LCEs, we discuss in detail the multiplicative ergodic theorem of Oseledec [102], which pro-vides the theoretical basis for the computation of the LCEs. Then, we analyze the algorithm for the computation of the maximal LCE, whose value has been exten-sively used as <b>an</b> indicator <b>of</b> chaos, and the algorithm of the so-called standard method, developed by Benettin et al. [14], for the computation of many LCEs. We also consider different discrete and continuous methods for computing the LCEs based on the QR or the singular value decomposition techniques. Although we are mainly interested in finite-dimensional conservative systems, i. e., autonomous Hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps, we also briefly refer to the evaluation of LCEs of dissipative systems and time series. The relation of two chaos detection techniques, namely the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) and the generalized alignment index (GALI), to the computation of the LCEs is also discussed...|$|R
