The <b>women</b> <b>who</b> use supplements did so {{because they believe that}} it is good for health and are concerned about lack of proper intake of daily meals, more so than the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> used drinks. 3.

The <b>women</b> <b>who</b> use supplements purchase them at a drugstore whereas <b>women</b> <b>who</b> use drinks purchase them at a supermarket. 5. 36. 9 % of the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> use supplements felt an effect whereas 13. 1 % felt no effect. 6.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{factors related}} to reproductive decision-making among HIV-infected women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of HIV-infected <b>women</b> (N= 104) <b>who</b> received care at an HIV clinic in the southern United States were interviewed about their reproductive decision-making. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> became pregnant subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not become pregnant, and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> underwent a sterilization procedure subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not get sterilized. RESULTS: Compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not get pregnant after receiving an HIV diagnosis, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> became pregnant {{were more likely to}} be young, single, diagnosed earlier in the epidemic and to have more recently used a noninjecting drug. Among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not get pregnant, 63 % reported their diagnosis greatly affected that decision. Having a partner who wants more children was not associated with pregnancy. Compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not get sterilized after learning their HIV status, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did get sterilized tended to be Baptist and already had a prior live birth. Neither a woman's desire nor her partner's desire for more children was associated with sterilization. CONCLUSIONS: HIV is an important influence on HIV-infected women's reproductive choices, regardless of the decision being made. Reproductive counseling by HIV care providers needs to be sensitive to all the issues faced by these women...|$|R

Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra.
