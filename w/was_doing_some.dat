They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.|$|E

Only 12 residents died between 1907 and 1910, but 48 residents died between 1911 and 1916. Among them was Franklin R. Andrews, an apparently healthy man.

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry. Powell {{recalled}} that [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> chores at home. I was sitting {{down on the floor}} folding laundry and I had that song in my head. All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and it scared me because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the {{inclusion}} {{of a wide range of}} characters from The Adventures of Tintin, Harry Thompson referred to the story as [...] "a Tintin family reunion", commenting that it was [...] "a story unusually full of the type of people Captain Haddock liked to avoid". Michael Farr believed that in reviving so many older characters, Hergé had given The Red Sea Sharks [...] "a marked retrospective quality". Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier thought that the story was too crowded, leaving little room for series regulars Professor Calculus or Thomson and Thompson, and leaving the introduced figure of Skut as [...] "a nice supporting character, but nothing more". The Lofficiers stated that [...] "Hergé <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> house-cleaning of his past works and characters before embarking on something more serious and with more personal resonance", Tintin in Tibet.|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1953 {{at the age}} of 13 Janis Martin was {{developing}} her own proto-rockabilly style on WRVA's Old Dominion Barn Dance, which broadcast out of Richmond, VA.

2500|$|The {{identity}} of Kalibangan as a pre-historic site {{was discovered by}} Luigi Pio Tessitori, an Italian Indologist (1887–1919). He <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> research in ancient Indian texts. He {{was surprised by the}} character of ruins in that area, and he sought help from Sir John Marshall of the Archaeological Survey of India. At that time ASI had some excavations done on Harappa, but they never had any idea about the character of the ruins. In fact, Tessitori is the first person to recognize that the ruins are 'Prehistoric' and [...] pre-Mauryan. Luigi Pio Tessitori also pointed out the nature of the culture, but at that time {{it was not possible to}} guess that Indus Valley Civilisation lay in the ruins of Kalibangan, and he died five years before Harappan culture was duly recognized.|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Bowdoin with a B.A. in Government and a minor in Asian Studies in 2004, Kondabolu had no {{intention}} of pursuing a stand-up comedy career. He moved to Seattle and took the LSAT preparatory to applying to law school, and worked as an immigrant rights organizer in Seattle for the organization Hate Free Zone (later renamed as OneAmerica) from 2005 to 2007. As part of Hate Free Zone's [...] "Liberty and Justice for All", he led a monthly conversation project focusing on immigration and human rights, saying, [...] "Grassroots organizers know; intimate meetings and real dialogue can cut through the cacophony like nothing else." [...] He found his organizing work fulfilling:I loved organizing, and, you know, I was working with victims of hate crimes, I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> work in detention centers and meeting families whose - you know, who had family members who were going to be deported, and, you know, it was really powerful, workplace discrimination cases...Although his stand-up comedy career was gaining traction in 2007, he was accepted to the Masters in Human Rights program at the London School of Economics in 2007, and thus took a hiatus year from stand-up to earn his MSc.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with just about a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the American way of life. Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E
