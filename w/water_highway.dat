This led to increased exploration and interest for fishing and logging during the era of the Industrial Revolution. After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, there was a boom in logging along with the creation of Lumber barons in the Great Lakes. The French River was [...] "ripe for the picking with its seamlessly inexhaustible supply of timber and proximity to the American markets".|$|E

50|$|Douglas County was {{organized}} {{at the site}} of one of the major <b>water</b> <b>highways</b> used by early travelers and voyagers of inland America. This water trail, the Bois Brule-St. Croix River Portage Trail, was the most convenient connecting link between Lake Superior and the Mississippi River. The Bois Brule and St. Croix River systems were separated only by a short portage over the Eastern Continental Divide near Solon Springs, Wisconsin. The northward traveler used this water trail reach Lake Superior, while the downstream traveler could use it to go southwest to the Gulf of Mexico, unhindered by portages, by using the St. Croix and Mississippi rivers. This waterway was also an important route in the Wisconsin fur trade, particularly when the French War with the Fox Indians closed the more southern routes.|$|R
50|$|The {{main artery}} Erie Canal was built between 1817 and 1825 and {{provided}} the key link in a <b>water</b> <b>highway</b> to {{what would become the}} Midwestern United States, connecting to the Great Lakes at Buffalo. It connected the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and then to the port of New York City. The Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York's unique topography which provided that area with the only break in the Appalachian range—allowing for east-west navigation from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes. The canal system gave New York State a competitive advantage, helped New York City develop as an international trade center, and allowed Buffalo to grow from just 2,000 settlers in 1820 to over 18,000 people by 1840. The port of New York became essentially the Atlantic home port for all of the Great Lakes states. It was because of this vital and critical connection that New York State became known as the Empire State.|$|E
5000|$|The Urarina, or an {{indigenous}} population living along the Chambira River, receive many {{benefits from the}} water system. Because {{they have access to}} a fresh water source, these people have developed different farming methods which make use of the river. The first of these is slash and burn farming, which involves exploiting a farm plot for three to five years before moving on to a new area. [...] The other kind of farming implemented is an open plot along the riverbank. During the dry season, the river recedes, leaving behind highly arable silt that is usually monocropped for a short season. The river also provides a crucial system of interconnected waterways to the Urarina. The men from the tribe make dugout canoes which provide the primary mode of transportation for the Urarina. [...] The river can be used to transport agricultural and other goods downstream to a market or to another tribe. Within the Chambira Basin, all of the rivers are connected in some way with tributaries, thus creating a <b>water</b> <b>highway</b> in the Peruvian jungle. Not only do primitive populations make use of the river system, but large-scale corporations transport goods along the rivers. The most notable example of this is the flotation of oil down the river from the many oil fields in the Selvaoil. [...] The Chambira River not only supports a complex ecosystem, but it also aids humans in their endeavors along the waterway.|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{multispectral}} scanner (MSS) {{data collected by}} the NASA 24 -channel MSS on July 26, 1972 (Mission 207) over the USDA, Research Farm at Weslaco, Texas, were evaluated for quality and for crop, soil, and water discrimination. The standard deviations {{for each of the}} 24 channels for a uniform surface, a water reservoir, were used as an indicator of system noise. By this criterion, channels 22, 20, 15, qnd 21 were of low quality. Based on the ratio of odd to even numbers in all channels, the conclusion was reached that the data are 7 -bit precision. An optimum channel selection program selected channels 7, 8, 3, and 18 as the best 4 channels for distinguishing among seven vegetal categories: Stoneville 213 cotton, Anton SP- 21 cotton, Valencia orange, Red Blush grapefruit, sugarcane, Coast-Cross 1 bermuda-grass and African stargrass. These same channels also distinguished the nonvegetal categories (<b>water,</b> <b>highway,</b> rooftops, and bare soil) satisfactorily. Among the vegetal categories, sugarcane and cotton had distinctive signatures that allowed them to be distinguished from grass and citrus.

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} and upgradation of river system for transportation activities has been significantly important {{in many countries}} due to their economic and environmental benefits. A proper integrated river management system has been formulated to address for the increasing demand for transport capacity. Besides transportation, human also use waterways for irrigation, drainage, hydropower generation, flood control, watershed treatment, water supply for industrial and domestic consumption, leisure and conservation of wildlife. Hence, the various relevant authorities rigorously involved direct or indirectly in river management system to cater for this needs. Thus, river management system {{can be regarded as}} a multipurpose management system aimed at providing and managing the river efficiently for transportation activity. Strategic partnership between different authorities will maximise the well being of the river system to operate effectively. Where possible, different river tributaries can be connected within the country or region to create a waterhighway for economic as well as environmental prosperity between bordering nations in the South East Asian region where the existing of many mighty rivers such as Irrawady in Myanmar, Mekong in Vietnam, Rajang in Malaysia, Menam Chao Phraya in Thailand, Mahakam in Indonesia etc can be connected together for creating a grand <b>water</b> <b>highway</b> for cargo movement, passenger transportation, leisure and tourism.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{theme in}} the study of any phase of Ohio River history is found in the great extent of the river system and the vast area of the drainage basin of the Mississippi to which this stream forms so important a part. The basin of the Mississippi, as has been aptly said, is the 2 ̆ 2 Body of the Nation, 2 ̆ 2 all other parts of the nation being but members, important in themselves, yet more important in their relation to this. (1) In extent it is the second great valley of the world, being exceeded only by that of the Amazon. (2) In a large sense the Mississippi valley includes the whole interior basin, a province which drains into 2, 000 miles of navigable water of the Mississippi itself, 2, 000 miles of the tawny flood of the Missouri, and 1, 000 miles of the Ohio, 5, 000 miles of main <b>water</b> <b>highway,</b> together with fifty-three subordinate rivers, navigable by steamboats, and some hundreds that are navigable by flats and keels. With an area of nearly two and one half million square miles of drainage basin, this drainage basin exceeds in extent the whole of Europe, exclusive of Russia, Norway, and Sweden and is estimated to be able to support a population of two or three hundred million – three times the present population of the whole nation. Conceptions formed from the river basins of Western Europe are rudely shocked when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi; nor are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of Siberia, lofty plateaus of Central Asia, or the mighty sweep of the swampy Amazon more adequate. (3) Latitude, elevation, and rainfall all combine to render this valley by far the first place upon our globe as a dwelling place for civilized man...|$|E
