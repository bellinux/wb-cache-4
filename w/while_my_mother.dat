25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends <b>while</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E

They seemed so utterly taken up with engagements, obligations, ceremonies," [...] Merrill would tell an interviewer in 1982. [...] "The excitement, the emotional quickening I felt in those years came usually through animals or nature, or through the servants in the house [...] [...] [...] whose lives seemed by contrast to make such perfect sense. The gardeners had their hands in the earth. The cook was dredging things with flour, making pies. My father was merely making money, <b>while</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> wrote names on place-cards, planned menus, and did her needlepoint." [...] Merrill's parents separated when he was eleven, then divorced when he was thirteen. [...] As a teenager, Merrill boarded at the Lawrenceville School, where he befriended future novelist Frederick Buechner, began writing poetry, and undertook early literary collaborations. [...] When Merrill was 16 years old, his father collected his short stories and poems and published them as a surprise under the name Jim's Book. [...] Initially pleased, Merrill would later regard the precocious book as an embarrassment. Today, it is considered a literary treasure worth thousands of dollars.|$|E
2500|$|Nicolae Iorga was {{a native}} of Botoșani, and is {{generally}} believed to have been born on January 17, 1871 (although his birth certificate has June 6). His father Nicu Iorga (a practicing lawyer) and mother Zulnia (née Arghiropol) belonged to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Details on the family's more distant origins remain uncertain: Iorga was widely reputed to be of partial Greek-Romanian descent; the rumor, still credited by some commentators, was rejected by the historian. In his own account: [...] "My father was from a family of Romanian traders from Botoșani, who were later received into the boyar class, <b>while</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is the daughter of Romanian writer Elena Drăghici, the niece of chronicler Manolache Drăghici... The [...] name Arghiropol notwithstanding, my maternal grandfather [...] from a family that moved in... from Bessarabia". Elsewhere, however, he acknowledged that the Arghiropols were possibly Byzantine Greeks. Iorga credited the five-generation-boyar status, received from his father's side, and the [...] "old boyar" [...] roots of his mother (the Miclescu family), with having turned him into a political man. His parallel claim of being related to noble families such as the Cantacuzinos and the Craiovești is questioned by other researchers.|$|E

60|$|To me personally, old Hasluck's {{coming and}} all that {{followed}} thereupon made perhaps more difference than to any one else. My father now was busy all the day; if not in his office, then away in the grim city of the giants, as I still thought of it; <b>while</b> to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> came every day more social and domestic duties; so that for a time I was left much to my own resources.|$|R

40|$|For my dissertation, I {{have chosen}} to write a Creative Nonfiction Memoir {{entitled}} Open Water. This work centers around the character of <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> who, {{at the age of}} fifty four decided to tackle a grueling 25 K (15. 5 mile) race, and dragged me into the experience as her swimming coach. As I began to tackle the project, I realized that I was dealing with two interwoven narratives: the narrative of the family, shifting and changing to accommodate <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> needs, and the ubiquitous “sports” narrative, the narrative of her athletic tribulations, trials and setbacks in the pursuit of her athletic goals. This is a work about the struggles that <b>my</b> family faced <b>while</b> supporting <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> in her open water swimming career. ...|$|R

60|$|I {{could fill}} this book with her stories, but I must not linger over them; and indeed I heard no more after I {{was eight years}} old. Until that time my brother and I were left under her charge in the country, <b>while</b> <b>my</b> father and <b>mother</b> were at court. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> {{was one of the}} Ladies of the Bedchamber of Queen Henrietta Maria, who had been enchanted to find in her a countrywoman, and of the same faith.

60|$|I felt a {{disposition}} to laugh outright, at {{the manner in}} which Jason betrayed a sneaking consciousness of crime, as he saw my meek, innocent, simple-minded, just and warm-hearted mother lay the cards on the table that evening. His sense of guilt was purely conventional, <b>while</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> sense of innocence existed in the absence of false instruction, and in the purity of her intentions. One had been taught no exaggerated and false notion of sin,--nay, a notion that is impious, as it is clearly impious in man to torture acts that are perfectly innocent, per se, into formal transgressions of the law of God,--while the other had been educated under the narrow and exaggerated notions of a provincial sect, and had obtained a species of conscience that was purely dependent on his miserable schooling. I heard my grandfather say that Jason actually showed the white of his eyes {{the first time he saw}} Mr. Worden begin to deal, and he still looked, the whole time we were at whist, as if he expected some one might enter, and tell of his delinquency, I soon discovered that Jason had a much greater dread of being told of, than of doing such things as taking a hand at whist, or drinking a glass of punch, from which I inferred his true conscience drew perceptible distinctions between the acts and the penalties he had been accustomed to see inflicted on them. He was much disposed to a certain sort of frailty; but it was a sneaking {{disposition to}} the last.|$|R

60|$|I {{caught the}} general there, and, <b>while</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{turned her head}} aside and smiled, I saw that my father colored a little, though he made out to laugh.

5000|$|Lowe was {{inspired}} to write the play by his mother: [...] "I {{grew up on the}} usual pulp of heroic war films and comics... While therefore I gained a fairly graphic picture of the life of a soldier, it occurred to me <b>while</b> talking to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that I had hardly any picture of those who stayed at home - those whose battles had been fought in the landscape I had grown up in. I knew nothing, really, about the sacrifices and suffering of the women who only a few years later were to pick me up and put me down, and place pennies in my hand. Pennies I had never thought to return." ...|$|R

60|$|As soon {{as might}} be I unbarred the door, <b>while</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was striving with {{trembling}} fingers to get a flame to the candle, and then there entered a young fellow who {{could hardly have been}} one and twenty, stout of frame, with a face betokening rarest good nature, but {{yet at the same time}} giving one to believe that he might be dull and heavy in his movements.|$|E
60|$|It {{was evident}} {{to me that}} my father's suit was {{infinitely}} better, both in texture and material, than that which our visitor had brought with him. As he had withdrawn his head, however, entirely beneath the bedclothes, {{there was nothing more}} to be said, so I descended to the lower room, where I found toy father busily engaged fastening a new buckle to his sword-belt <b>while</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and the maid were preparing the morning meal.|$|E
60|$|As {{my father}} was quite unable to let {{more than one of}} these houses at a time, and {{that for the most part}} to {{eccentric}} and undesirable tenants, he thought it politic to live in one of the two others, and devote the rent he received from the let one, when it was let, to the incessant necessary repairing of all three. He also did some of the repairing himself and, smoking a bull-dog pipe the <b>while,</b> which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would not allow him to do in the house, he cultivated vegetables in a sketchy, unpunctual and not always successful manner in the unoccupied gardens. The three houses faced north, and the back of the one we occupied was covered by a grape-vine that yielded, I remember, small green grapes for pies in the spring, and imperfectly ripe black grapes in favourable autumns for the purposes of dessert. The grape-vine played an important part in my life, for my father broke his neck while he was pruning it, when I was thirteen.|$|R

I blundered to my feet, and was striking a match with the intention of lighting the candles, when the sharp, vehement cry broke out again so loud and so clear that it might have been in the very room with me. My chamber is {{in the front of the}} house, <b>while</b> those of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and sister are at the back, so that I am the only one who commands a view of the avenue.|$|R

6000|$|And then, to {{make the}} {{situation}} worse, in raising some heavy machinery connected with the self-binder, I strained my side so seriously that I was unable to walk.
