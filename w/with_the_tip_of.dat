5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The {{original}} ball {{of cells}} develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance {{to this is}} known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
25|$|Its {{place of}} {{articulation}} is dental, alveolar or post-alveolar, {{which means it}} is articulated behind upper front teeth, at the alveolar ridge or behind the alveolar ridge. It is most often apical, which means that it is pronounced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue.|$|E
25|$|The dental series th, nh, lh {{are always}} laminal (that is, {{pronounced}} by touching with {{the surface of}} the tongue just above the tip, called the blade of the tongue), but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, on the speaker, and on how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. These are interdental <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue visible between the teeth, as in th in English; dental <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the blade is visible between the teeth; and denti-alveolar, that is, with both the tip and the blade making contact with the back of the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French t, d, n, l. The first tends to be used in careful enunciation, and the last in more rapid speech, while the tongue-down articulation is less common.|$|E

25|$|The {{alveolar}} series t, n, l (or d, n, l) is straightforward: {{across the}} continent, these sounds are alveolar (that is, pronounced by touching the tongue to the ridge {{just behind the}} gum line of the upper teeth) and apical (that is, touching that ridge <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue). This {{is very similar to}} English t, d, n, l, though the Australian t is not aspirated, even in Kalaw Lagaw Ya, despite its other stops being aspirated.|$|E
25|$|In a nanorecording application, {{a certain}} rotaxane is {{deposited}} as a Langmuir-Blodgett film on ITO-coated glass. When a positive voltage is applied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} probe, the rotaxane rings in the tip area switch to {{a different part of}} the dumbbell and the resulting new conformation makes the molecules stick out 0.3 nanometer from the surface.

25|$|In his time, the gnomon {{was simply}} a {{vertical}} pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip’s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.|$|E

25|$|The forward {{place of}} {{articulation}} is alveolar or postalveolar, {{depending on the}} language, and apical, which means it is articulated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue against the alveolar ridge or {{the roof of the}} mouth behind the alveolar ridge. (Damin contrasted these two articulations as separate phonemes.) The release is a sharp, plosive sound in southern Africa, but in Sandawe it may be percussive, with the underside of the tip of the tongue striking the floor of the mouth after the release of the click (see below), and in Hadza the release is often quite weak.|$|E
25|$|Proprioception, the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October, {{police found}} {{the body of a}} 16-year-old boy, named Vadim Gromov, at Donleskhoz station. The wounds upon Gromov's body {{immediately}} linked his murder to the manhunt: the youth had been strangled, stabbed 27 times and castrated, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> his tongue severed and his left eye stabbed. Gromov had been killed on 17 October, 10 days {{before the start of the}} initiative. The same day Gromov's body was found, Chikatilo lured another 16-year-old boy, Viktor Tishchenko, off a train at Kirpichnaya station, another station under surveillance from undercover police, and killed him in a nearby forest. Tishchenko's body—bearing 40 separate knife wounds—was found on 3 November.|$|E

25|$|On 26 July 1941, the Italians {{launched}} a seaborne {{attack on the}} Grand Harbour with two human torpedoes, four MAS boats and six MT boats. The force was detected early on by a British radar facility, and the coastal artillery at Saint Elmo opened fire when the Italians approached to close range. In the attack, 15 men were killed and 18 captured, and all the human torpedoes and MT boats, along {{with two of the}} MAS boats were lost. One of the MT boats hit Saint Elmo Bridge, which linked the breakwater <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the peninsula near the fort, and the bridge collapsed. The bridge was never restored, and it was only in 2012 that a new one was built in its place with a similar but different design.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} week a {{swelling}} appears {{from the second}} pharyngeal arch, in the midline, called the copula. During the fifth and sixth weeks the copula is overgrown by a swelling from {{the third and fourth}} arches (mainly from the third arch) called the hypopharyngeal eminence, and this develops into the posterior part of the tongue (the other third). The hypopharyngeal eminence develops mainly by the growth of endoderm from the third pharyngeal arch. The boundary between the two parts of the tongue, the anterior from the first arch and the posterior from the third arch is marked by the terminal sulcus. The terminal sulcus is shaped like a V <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the V situated posteriorly. At the tip of the terminal sulcus is the foramen caecum, which is the point where the embryological thyroid begins to descend.|$|E
25|$|Optical fibers {{can be used}} as {{sensors to}} measure strain, temperature, {{pressure}} and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength, or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the fiber. These can be implemented by various micro- and nanofabrication technologies, such that they do not exceed the microscopic boundary of the fiber tip, allowing such applications as insertion into blood vessels via hypodermic needle.|$|E

500|$|ATP synthase is {{a massive}} protein complex with a mushroom-like shape. The {{mammalian}} enzyme complex contains 16 subunits and has a mass of approximately 600 kilodaltons. The portion embedded within the membrane is called FO and contains a ring of c subunits and the proton channel. The stalk and the ball-shaped headpiece is called F1 and {{is the site of}} ATP synthesis. The ball-shaped complex {{at the end of the}} F1 portion contains six proteins of two different kinds (three α subunits and three β subunits), whereas the [...] "stalk" [...] consists of one protein: the γ subunit, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the stalk extending into the ball of α and β subunits. Both the α and β subunits bind nucleotides, but only the β subunits catalyze the ATP synthesis reaction. Reaching along the side of the F1 portion and back into the membrane is a long rod-like subunit that anchors the α and β subunits into the base of the enzyme.|$|E
500|$|Thomasomys ucucha is a {{medium-sized}} Thomasomys {{with a relatively}} long tail. The dense, fine, and soft fur is dark brown on the upperparts, changing gradually into the grey underparts.

500|$|Neuromancer {{was written}} on a [...] "clockwork typewriter," [...] the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates {{from somewhere in the}} 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs {{slightly}} less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black [...] "crackle" [...] paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow.
