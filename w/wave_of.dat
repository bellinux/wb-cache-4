The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed {{that he had been}} remastering the band's discography. The first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> albums, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III, were released on 2 June 2014. The second <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> albums, Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014. Physical Graffiti {{was released}} on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release.

5|$|A fresh <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> {{concerns}} about France {{followed in the}} 1880s, accompanied {{by the introduction of}} still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> modernisation. An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E
5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{distributions}} {{of the main}} properties of the mode function and kinematic and non-linear parameters <b>of</b> internal <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the second mode are derived for the South China Sea for typical summer conditions in July. The calculations {{are based on the}} Generalized Digital Environmental Model (GDEM) climatology of hydrological variables, from which the local stratification is evaluated. The focus is on the phase speed <b>of</b> long internal <b>waves</b> and the coefficients at the dispersive, quadratic and cubic terms of the weakly non-linear Gardner model. Spatial {{distributions of}} these parameters, except for the coefficient at the cubic term, are qualitatively similar for <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> both modes. The dispersive term of Gardner's equation and phase speed for internal <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the second mode are about a quarter and half, respectively, <b>of</b> those for <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the first mode. Similarly to the <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the first mode, the coefficients at the quadratic and cubic terms of Gardner's equation are practically independent of water depth. In contrast to the <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the first mode, for <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the second mode the quadratic term is mostly negative. The results can serve as a basis for expressing estimates of the expected parameters <b>of</b> internal <b>waves</b> for the South China Sea...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study several aspects <b>of</b> solitary <b>wave</b> {{solutions}} <b>of</b> the Ostrovsky equation.

We also investigate {{the properties of the}} function d(c) which determines the stability of the ground states. Using an important scaling identity, together with numerical approximations <b>of</b> the solitary <b>waves,</b> we are able to numerically approximate d(c). These calculations suggest that d is convex everywhere, and therefore all ground state solitary <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the Ostrovsky equation are stable. ...|$|R

5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E
