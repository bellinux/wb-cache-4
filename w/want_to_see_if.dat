500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the book's publication, Timothy L. O'Brien was a {{reporter}} for The New York Times, and had reported on Donald Trump's businesses since 1990. O'Brien interviewed Trump for the book, and said that Trump enjoyed his presence, despite O'Brien's claim that Trump once referred to him as a [...] "total whack job." [...] Trump said that he cooperated with O'Brien because, [...] "It's almost like a competitive thing with me. I almost <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> you can get Trump." [...] O'Brien also interviewed contestants from Trump's reality television series, The Apprentice, as well as Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, casino owner Steve Wynn, and former New York City mayor Ed Koch.|$|E
2500|$|When {{considering}} {{these large}} objects, we might also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> {{the notion of}} counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets. [...] It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example {{we can see that}} if some object [...] "one greater than infinity" [...] exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called ordinals, based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 May 2006, the Financial Times {{reported}} that Murdoch would be hosting {{a fund-raiser for}} Senator Hillary Clinton's (D-New York) Senate re-election campaign. In a 2008 interview with Walt Mossberg, Murdoch was asked whether he had [...] "anything {{to do with the}} New York Posts endorsement of Barack Obama in the democratic primaries." [...] Without hesitating, Murdoch replied, [...] "Yeah. He is a rock star. It's fantastic. I love what he is saying about education. I don't think he will win Florida... but he will win in Ohio and the election. I am anxious to meet him. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> he will walk the walk." [...] Murdoch is a strong supporter of Israel and its domestic policies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E
2500|$|However, the film's director, Takashi Yamazaki, {{rejected}} {{these interpretations}} of the film, saying, [...] "The film depicts the war as a complete tragedy, {{so how can you}} say it glorifies war?... I really don't get it." [...] He eventually dismissed such criticism, saying that [...] "In the end, people see what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>If</b> you think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're going to see it as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what." [...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow our memories of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite [...] side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...] It is drawing fire literally from all directions." ...|$|E
