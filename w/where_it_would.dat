5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, plans arose {{to create a}} new highway link {{on the south side of}} Lake Simcoe to connect Highway400 and Highway12. The route for this {{extension}} was announced on June30, 1978. It was to follow 11th Line from Highway400 east to the Holland Marsh, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cross towards the northeast onto the alignment of Ravenshoe Road (York Road32). The extension would traverse the length of Ravenshoe Road to Lakeridge Road (Durham Road23), <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> zig-zag onto Concession Road7 to end immediately north of Sunderland.|$|E

5|$|A crosstown line via Worth Street {{would serve}} as a branch of the IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks. The line would have {{branched}} off at Church Street, from <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> run via Worth Street and East Broadway to Lewis Street. This two-tracks segment would have cost $15,200,000. The line would then tunnel under the East River between Lewis Street to Driggs Avenue. This section would have cost $18,500,000. The South Fourth Street junction would be completed.|$|E

5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 the Board {{decided to}} seek powers {{to extend the}} railway beyond Gupworthy to {{workings}} in Joyce's Cleeve in the Quarme Valley. Preliminary notices to this effect were published, but no application was made. Had the line been built it would have entailed another incline, which ore {{would have had to}} ascend before travelling eastwards to Brendon Hill <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> travel down again.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this time}} that Giáp began his countermoves. He had {{expected}} an attack, but could not foresee when or <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> occur. Giáp realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon Lai Châu Province and fight a pitched battle at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from Việt Bắc.|$|E

40|$|Female {{circumcision}} is {{a practice}} which j. s appalling to many Westerners, yet in cultures <b>where</b> <b>it</b> occurs, {{it is often}} considered only a custom. Yet the failure of repeated attempts to eliminate the practice by both Westerners and non-Westerners suggests that female circumcision is intricately interwoven into the social structure of the cultures <b>where</b> <b>it</b> occurs. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> seem that the practice has symbolic meaning and is somehow functional. This research is a comparative theoretical study of the occurrance of {{and the importance of}} female circumcision within two different cultures in Africa, the Sudanese and the Maasai...|$|R

5|$|This plan is viable only {{if certain}} {{conditions}} are met. The d7-square must {{be available for}} the Ne5, {{so that it can}} later transfer to f6. White should also not be able to easily advance the e3-pawn to e4, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be adequately defended by the Nc3 and a possible Bf3. Finally, White should not have the time to launch a quick attack on Black's castled position with the pawn thrust f4–f5–f6.|$|E
5|$|Under weak {{steering}} currents while detached to the front, Diana drifted westward, {{and came}} within 50miles (85km) of the Florida coast. Rather than continuing westward, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have hit near Cape Canaveral, Diana {{turned to the}} northwest where it paralleled the coastline. The storm, continually strengthening over the Gulf Stream, turned to the northeast and became a hurricane on September 10. On September11 and September12, Diana rapidly intensified to a peak of 130mph (215km/h) winds while remaining offshore.|$|E

5|$|After briefly {{stopping}} in Albany, where its convoy was delayed due to {{concerns over the}} presence of German warships en route, the 10th Battalion departed Australian waters in November and proceeded towards Egypt. Initially, the plan had been for the battalion to continue on the United Kingdom from <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> subsequently move to the Western Front. Poor conditions and overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom resulted {{in the decision to}} disembark the Australians in Alexandria instead. Arriving there on 4 December 1914, the battalion was sent into camp at Mena, near Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Carter gave 90 {{pages of}} the {{screenplay}} to Fox who received it well. While not officially greenlighted, he got a budget from Fox and began to make plans as to when and <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be filmed. Carter then enlisted Daniel Sackheim as a producer on the film. Sackheim had previously produced the pilot episode of The X-Files and directed several episodes {{in the first two}} seasons. The X-Files marked his first contribution as producer to a feature film. Carter's choice for director was Rob Bowman, who had been the series' executive producer and a director before the production base was moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench.

5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines. It would offer New Jersey commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. If opened, the extension {{would take the}} New York City Subway outside the state's borders for the first time. The plan would replace the Access to the Region's Core (ARC) tunnel, which was canceled by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5. Plans {{at the time}} were to build a new {{alignment}} from east of Ridgefield to Little Ferry southeast of Hackensack and form Route S5 (now Route 93) along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new Route 6 would share the alignment of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> turn southeast onto a new alignment to Little Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own alignment to the George Washington Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{construction}} began {{on a new}} arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through downtown Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964; however, NY8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway. In the mid-1960s, plans were made to construct a new limited-access highway along the NY8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> connect with the North–South Arterial.|$|E

5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that is, {{the sound was}} on a {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be photographed {{on the side of}} the film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.|$|E
5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was entered}} in the tournament's South region <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> play its first two games at The Palace of Auburn Hills in nearby Auburn Hills, Michigan. As a number four seed, Michigan opened the tournament by {{defeating}} South Dakota State 71–56, giving the team its most wins in 20 years and matching Beilein's career high as it raised its record to 27–7. Michigan then ousted 5th-seeded VCU by a 78–53 margin. That gave Michigan its first Sweet Sixteen appearance since the 1993–94 team went to the 1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.|$|E
