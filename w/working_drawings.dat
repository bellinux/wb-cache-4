5|$|In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee {{selected}} Dworsky {{as executive}} architect {{to work with}} designated architect Frank Gehry in designing the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> that would meet building code specifications. By 1994, {{the cost of the}} project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years behind schedule). Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him a spoiled, impractical artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} altered again in 1837–42 by Edward Blore for Hungerford Crewe. Blore {{replaced}} a local architect, George Latham, {{who had been}} commissioned in 1836. Many of Blore's <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> survive in the Royal Institute of British Architects archive. He carried out decorative work to the interior in the Jacobethan style and made major changes to the plan of the ground floor, which included replacing the screens passage with an entrance hall and covering the central courtyard to create a single-storey central hall. He also fitted plate glass windows throughout and installed a warm-air heating system. The total cost, including his work on estate buildings, was £30,000 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|The Avon then {{flows through}} Bathford, {{where it is}} joined by the Bybrook River, and Bathampton where it passes under the Bathampton Toll Bridge. It is joined by the Lam Brook at Lambridge in Bath and then passes under Cleveland and Pulteney Bridges and over the weir. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine, owner of the Coalbrookdale Ironworks, with Henry Goodridge as the architect, {{on the site of}} a Roman ferry crossing. Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, it spans the River Avon at Bathwick, and enabled further {{development}} of Georgian Bath to take place {{on the south side of}} the river. It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day, horse-drawn vehicles and pedestrians, and was constructed using Bath Stone and a cast iron arched span. Pulteney Bridge was completed in 1773 and is designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The bridge was designed by Robert Adam, whose <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> are preserved in the Sir John Soane's Museum, and is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides. It is named after Frances Pulteney, heiress in 1767 of the Bathwick estate across the river from Bath. Pulteney approached the brothers Robert and James Adam with his new town in mind, but Robert Adam then became involved in the design of the bridge. In his hands the simple construction envisaged by Pulteney became an elegant structure lined with shops. Adam had visited both Florence and Venice, where he would have seen the Ponte Vecchio and the Ponte di Rialto. But Adam's design more closely followed Andrea Palladio's rejected design for the Rialto. Pulteney Bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that Adam created. In 1792 alterations to enlarge the shops marred the elegance of the façades. Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge, which had been constructed with inadequate support. It was rebuilt by John Pinch the elder, surveyor to the Pulteney estate, in a less ambitious version of Adam's design. 19th century shopkeepers altered windows, or cantilevered out over the river as the fancy took them. The western end pavilion on the south side was demolished in 1903 for road widening and its replacement was not an exact match. In 1936 the bridge became scheduled as a national monument, with plans being made for the restoration of the original façade. The restoration was completed in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951, with further work being carried out in 1975. Bath and North East Somerset council have discussed plans to ban vehicles from the bridge and turn it into a pedestrianised zone, however it remains open to buses and taxis.|$|E

25|$|Delayed {{delivery}} of machines kept the factory unfinished throughout 1896 and into 1897. During 1896 Daimler sold imported cars from companies for which Lawson held the licences. Cannstatt supplied engine parts but the {{delivery of}} <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> were delayed for months. Four experimental cars were built in Coventry and a Panhard van was dismantled and reverse engineered. Some Daimler engines, with details redesigned by works manager J. S.

25|$|Early {{sketches}} by Daniel Burnham show {{a design}} with an (unexecuted) clockface and {{a far more}} elaborate crown than in the actual building. Though Burnham maintained overall control of the design process, he was not directly connected with {{the details of the}} structure as built; credit should be shared with his designer Frederick P. Dinkelberg, a Pennsylvania-born architect in Burnham's office, who first worked for Burnham in putting together the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, for which Burnham was the chief of construction and master designer. <b>Working</b> <b>drawings</b> for the Flatiron Building, however, remain to be located, though renderings were published at the time of construction in American Architect and Architectural Record.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{also paid}} $560,000 for non-exclusive {{rights to the}} design and <b>working</b> <b>drawings.</b> In {{addition}} to the 1,503 examples purchased in France and used there, 626 were manufactured by or for the US in the United States (stated to have been {{at a cost of}} more than $10,000,000). The Model 1918 built in the US differed somewhat from French models, with a straight rather than curved shield, rubber rather than steel tyres on wheels, a pivoting spade and a slightly different firing mechanism. US units were in action in France in 1918 with the 1,503 French-built guns. The first US regiment equipped with US-made guns was about to embark for France when World War I ended. The 1,503 as had been purchased from France were brought to the United States in 1919.|$|E
25|$|In later works {{painted by}} the workshop, the {{drawings}} are often painfully {{more attractive than}} the paintings. Most Raphael drawings are rather precise—even initial sketches with naked outline figures are carefully drawn, and later <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> often have {{a high degree of}} finish, with shading and sometimes highlights in white. They lack the freedom and energy of some of Leonardo's and Michelangelo's sketches, but are nearly always aesthetically very satisfying. He {{was one of the last}} artists to use metalpoint (literally a sharp pointed piece of silver or another metal) extensively, although he also made superb use of the freer medium of red or black chalk. In his final years he was one of the first artists to use female models for preparatory drawings—male pupils ("garzoni") were normally used for studies of both sexes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, ongoing {{modifications}} to the Treasury Building concerned Young, expected to create <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> based on plans by Walter. For the South Wing, he invented a column capital which symbolized the department, substituting acanthus leaves of the Corinthian order with eagles and a fist holding a key. Young held the role until he retired on July 24, 1862, dismissed by Salmon P. Chase of the Lincoln administration. Chase's friend from Cincinnati, Isaiah Rogers, succeeded him as Supervising Architect, although the Civil War curtailed the department's activities. Several of Young's buildings would {{play a part in}} the rebellion, particularly his custom house in Richmond, Virginia, which served as the Confederate Treasury. When Richmond in April 1865 was evacuated by the Army of Northern Virginia, with orders to burn warehouses and factories, the Richmond Custom House survived the conflagration—a testament to its fire-proofing. Indeed, from its courtroom Jefferson Davis was indicted for treason in May 1866.|$|E

25|$|Gartenskulptor (Garden Sculpture), for instance, {{had started}} out as a copy of the {{multiple}} P.O.TH.A.A.VFB, a self-portrait bust made of chocolate and birdseed standing on a bird-table, exposed to the elements. Referred to by Roth as a 'dis- and re-assembly object', each new incarnation gradually acquired <b>working</b> <b>drawings,</b> paintings, sculpted rabbits and collages placed on trellises in collector's gardens. It even acquired a real rabbit and the rabbit's hutch for a number of years. The last time it was installed in a garden was in 1989. When it was exhibited indoors in Switzerland, 1992, Gartenskulptor took up an entire room. By 1995 it was 20m long and included all sorts of objects including a fire ladder and television screens. By 2000, in Mönchengladbach, it was 40 metres long, having acquired elements from each of the installations' incarnations, including pebbly earth excavated by the architects Herzog and de Meuron for the facade of the Schaulager, for instance. The rabbit was no longer present.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Rodionov, {{chief of}} the Department of Construction, {{estimated}} that the lead ship could be launched {{in the spring of}} 1906 and be ready for a shooting practice in the spring of 1907. By the end of 1903 this schedule was already broken by a confusion over <b>working</b> <b>drawings.</b> Both master builders (Skvortsov for the New Admiraly and Ratnik for Baltic Shipyard) complained about poorly executed drafts. Ratnik noticed that the bilge keels added by the NTC did not fit into existing drydocks of his yard. He again alerted the admirals of the inevitable overload and demanded redesign of belt armor to match the expected rise in waterline level. According to Skvortsov, the proposed technology called for unnecessary breaks in construction schedule because deck armor could only be ordered and made to measure after completion of underlying structure. He proposed replacement of armor deck with softer steel which could be cut on site, saving a whole year of idle time, but the NTC insisted on following the original plan.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, <b>working</b> from {{engineering}} <b>drawings</b> {{developed by}} engineers and technologists, tool makers lay out (mark out) the design on {{the raw material}} (usually metal), then cut it to size and shape using manually controlled machine tools (such as lathes, milling machines, grinding machines, and jig grinders), power tools (such as die grinders and rotary tools), and hand tools (such as files and honing stones).|$|R
500|$|Twenty {{years later}} the Soviet Navy issued a {{requirement}} for a ship capable of dealing with enemy cruisers, but the design began to grow as it was modified to allow for combat with German pocket battleships on even terms, and later modified to gain parity with the s. Two ships were laid down in 1939, but development of their new guns lagged significantly behind their construction and six [...] twin-gun turrets were ordered from Germany in 1940. The <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> for the turrets and guns had not even been received when Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941.

500|$|Sovetsky Soyuz (—Soviet Union) was {{formally}} laid down 15 July 1938 in Shipyard Nr. 189 (Ordzhonikidze) in Leningrad, although {{evidence suggests that}} construction actually began in January 1939 after her slipway was completed, the necessary cranes were in place, and <b>working</b> <b>drawings</b> had been completed. When the war began she {{was estimated to be}} 21.19% complete, with [...] of steel assembled on the slip. She was only lightly damaged by German air attacks and bombardments, and, as some material had been used during the Siege of Leningrad, she was estimated to be 19.5% complete {{after the end of the}} war. Some thought was given to completing her, but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of the experience gained during the war. Stalin's expressed desire to see one of the Project 23-class ships completed only delayed the decision to scrap her; this was ordered on 29 May 1948 and was well underway by April 1949.|$|E

Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and both ships were launched {{less than three years}} after work began. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed by a number of changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War. Maximum elevation of the main guns was increased from 15 degree to 35 degrees, the number of torpedo tubes was reduced from five to two, mine stowage was eliminated as were the [...] guns. The armour protection of the waterline fore and aft of the main belt was increased to prevent the sort of damage that disabled several ships at the Battle of Tsushima. A second conning tower was added {{at the rear of the}} superstructure and its design was altered, probably to eliminate the overhanging top that deflected splinters into the conning tower at the Battle of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima. The masts and their fighting tops were replaced by light pole masts and light booms replaced the heavy boat cranes to save weight.|$|E
