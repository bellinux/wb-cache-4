50|$|Like their Type B 4-6-0 sister engines, the {{locomotives}} had bar frames. The drivers, {{the middle}} wheelset of the coupled wheels, were flangeless {{to enable the}} engine to negotiate sharp curves. The coupled wheels were not spaced equidistant from each other, with 39 in between the <b>wheel</b> <b>centres</b> of the leading wheelset and the drivers and 36 in between the <b>wheel</b> <b>centres</b> of the drivers and the trailing wheelset.|$|R
2500|$|The J class also {{featured}} {{a number of}} other design advances over the K class. It had a larger grate, enabling grate sections to be compatible with those of the N class and permitting an increase in firebox volume sufficient to allow two arch tubes to be installed. Another innovation was the use of a regulator valve incorporating a centrifugal steam separator (to draw away any water and thus provide the driest steam), rather than the simpler (though extremely reliable) D regulator valve used in the K class. The J class {{also featured}} [...] substantially redesigned cylinder porting to improve steam flow and efficiency. The innovative SCOA-P type driving <b>wheel</b> <b>centre</b> developed for the Victorian Railways R class was adapted for the [...] diameter J class drivers.|$|E
50|$|Replacing a whole wheel {{because of}} a worn contact surface is expensive, so older types of railway wheels were fitted with {{replaceable}} steel tires. The tire is a hoop of steel that is fitted around the steel <b>wheel</b> <b>centre.</b> The tire is machined with a shoulder on its outer face to locate it on the <b>wheel</b> <b>centre,</b> and a groove on the inside diameter of the flange face. The inside diameter of the tire is machined to be slightly less than {{the diameter of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>centre</b> on which it is mounted, to give an interference fit.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of tires}} is {{becoming}} obsolete. The utilisation of traditional freight wagons was often {{so low that}} tires never needed renewal, so it was cheaper to fit a one-piece ("monoblock") wheel. Monoblock wheels are lighter and offer better integrity {{as there is no}} tire to come loose. Modern flow-line repair lines are disrupted by the inspection of the <b>wheel</b> <b>centre</b> once the tire is removed, possibly generating extra rectification work, and the need to make each tire fit its allocated <b>wheel</b> <b>centre.</b> Monoblock wheels are now more economical.|$|E
5000|$|In 1944, the LMS re-gauged {{a pair of}} [...] "Jinty" [...] 0-6-0 tank {{locomotives}} - originally {{built to}} UK [...] - for use on its [...] gauge Northern Counties Committee (NCC) lines in Northern Ireland; re-designated as Class Y, they largely undertook shunting work on dockyard lines in Belfast. The re-gauging was performed by simply reversing the <b>wheel</b> <b>centres</b> so that the spokes dished outwards.|$|R
5000|$|The LNWR 4 ft 6in Tank was a {{class of}} 220 {{passenger}} 2-4-2T locomotives manufactured by the London and North Western Railway in their Crewe Works between 1879 and 1898.

50|$|The DT77 (motored) and TR262 (trailer) bolsterless bogies are {{developed}} from the DT71 and TR255 bogies used on the E233 series EMUs. The end bogies of the Tc driving cars are designated TR262, and the inner bogies of the Tc driving cars are designated TR262A. All the bogies use tread brakes, and the trailer bogies additionally use disc brakes. Wheel diameter is 860 mm, and the distance between <b>wheel</b> <b>centres</b> is 2,100 mm.|$|R

50|$|Some steam {{locomotive}} wheels had tires bolted through the rim, {{or with a}} second smaller shoulder machined on the inside face of the tire. This shoulder was severely limited in size as it had to pass over the <b>wheel</b> <b>centre</b> for assembly.|$|E
50|$|Attempts to make finer tyre and flange {{standards}} were thwarted initially by the overscale rail sections available commercially, it being impractical {{for an individual}} modeller to make smaller rails - although some did attempt to, by cutting down commercial rail. Smaller flange and tyre dimensions were also unsuccessful, as the narrow tyres tended to detach from the <b>wheel</b> <b>centres.</b> More critically, small flanges required comparably smaller rail, trackwork gaps and point frogs {{in order to work}} reliably.|$|R
25|$|Changes include ZF-9HP {{automatic}} transmission, new {{driver assistance}} and convenience features (Park Exit (to automatically exit parallel parking bays), Perpendicular Park (to position the car centrally in parking bays), Closing Vehicle Sensing and Reverse Traffic Detection (to warn drivers of oncoming traffic), Lane Departure Warning, Traffic Sign Recognition and Wade Sensing), optional Land Rover InControl connected car system, new colour {{options for the}} interior, four new alloy wheel styles, a new style of Land Rover badge on the grille, <b>wheel</b> <b>centres</b> and tailgate.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell plates}} of the boiler and firebox were of mild steel, the tubes were of brass and the firebox of copper. The grates {{were of the}} finger-bar rocking type. The bar frame was 4+1/2 in thick and was {{machined}} from solid mild steel slab. Steel castings were provided for the front buffer, knees at the motion plate, spring and compensating beam brackets, axlebox guides, <b>wheel</b> <b>centres</b> and eccentric sheaves. The cylinders were each cast in one piece {{with half of the}} boiler saddle.|$|R

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of this torque can be calculated {{as the product of}} the lateral force generated at the contact patch and the distance behind the <b>wheel</b> <b>centre</b> at which that force acts. This distance is known as the pneumatic trail. The steering torque around a non-vertical steer axis with non-zero mechanical trail is given by (trail+pneumatic trail)*cos(caster angle)*Fy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{independent}} front suspension used a transverse mounted {{leaf spring}} mounted above the <b>wheel</b> <b>centre</b> line.

50|$|A 2-6-2T steam locomotive, {{the design}} of Russell is {{more closely related to}} Hunslet No 865 of 1905 {{otherwise}} known as Leeds Number 1, although certain engineering aspects can be more readily associated with design of locomotives supplied to the Sierra Leone Government Railway. One of the driving <b>wheel</b> <b>centres</b> bears the initials SLR, however this has been found to have been a later replacement and not as originally supplied. Originally built with air train brakes, it was converted to vacuum train brakes following the linking of the Welsh Highland and Ffestiniog Railways.|$|R
