25|$|At {{the onset}} of the First World War, the cost of gold was very low and {{therefore}} the pound sterling had high value. But during the First World War, the value of the pound fell alarmingly due to rising war expenses. At the conclusion of the war, the value of the pound was only a fraction of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prior to the commencement of the war. It remained low until 1925, when the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, restored it to pre-War levels. As a result, the price of gold fell rapidly. While the rest of Europe purchased large quantities of gold from the United Kingdom, there was little increase in her gold reserves. This dealt a blow to an already deteriorating British economy. The United Kingdom began to look to its possessions as India to compensate for the gold that was sold.|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, {{delivered}} {{a speech to}} the Senate she called a [...] "Declaration of Conscience". In a clear attack upon McCarthyism, she {{called for an end to}} [...] "character assassinations" [...] and named [...] "some of the basic principles of Americanism: The right to criticize; The right to hold unpopular beliefs; The right to protest; The right of independent thought". She said [...] "freedom of speech is not <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in America", and decried [...] "cancerous tentacles of 'know nothing, suspect everything' attitudes". Six other Republican senators—Wayne Morse, Irving M. Ives, Charles W. Tobey, Edward John Thye, George Aiken, and Robert C. Hendrickson—joined Smith in condemning the tactics of McCarthyism.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the first}} forty {{official}} copies {{are made of}} the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using {{a large number of}} replicas—especially the national primary standards, which are rarely used—can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. It is also clear that the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50µg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies. The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world. This relative nature of the changes amongst the world's kilogram prototypes is often misreported in the popular press, and even some notable scientific magazines, which often state that the IPK simply [...] "lost 50µg" [...] and omit the very important caveat of [...] "in comparison to its official copies".Even well respected organizations incorrectly represent the relative nature of the mass divergence as being one of mass loss, as exemplified by , and , and [...] The root of the problem is often the reporters' failure to correctly interpret or paraphrase nuanced scientific concepts, as exemplified by [...] by the Associated Press published on PhysOrg.com. In that AP story, Richard Davis—who used to be the NIST's kilogram specialist and now works for the BIPM in France—was correctly quoted by the AP when he stated that the mass change is a relative issue. Then the AP summarized the nature of issue with this lead-in to the story: [...] "A kilogram just isn't <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> The 118-year-old cylinder that is the international prototype for the metric mass, kept tightly under lock and key outside Paris, is mysteriously losing weight— if ever so slightly". Like many of the above-linked sites, the AP also misreported the age of the IPK, using the date of its adoption as the mass prototype, not the date of the cylinder's manufacture. This is a mistake even Scientific American fell victim to in a print edition. Moreover, there are no technical means available {{to determine whether or not}} the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass [...] "relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000µg over a period of 100 or even 50 years". Given the lack of data identifying which of the world's kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25µg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.|$|E

2500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: [...] "It’s {{no secret that}} The Simpsons isn’t <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> The past few seasons have been hit or miss, but {{once in a while}} an episode comes along that reminds me why I’ve kept watching. 'Lisa the Drama Queen' is one of those episodes." [...] Robert Canning of IGN commented: [...] "It's been argued that Lisa episodes of The Simpsons are basically hit and miss. In my opinion, the boring, unfunny Lisa episodes far outweigh the classic Lisa episodes. 'Lisa the Drama Queen' was one of those episodes that fell into the boring majority. There were a number of reasons for this— too many song montages, for one— but ultimately it boiled down to the uninspired storyline. Worst episode of the Simpsons ever." ...|$|E

[...] There's a potential to be a major change in the political structure of New Orleans." [...] Some perceived these comments to be a divisive follow-up to his [...] "Chocolate City" [...] remarks, while others point out that the fact that Nagin is the only major African-American candidate in a field of 23 is a sign of the demographic shift in a city that was over two-thirds black before Katrina.|$|E

2500|$|The San Pedro fishing {{industry}} {{reached its peak}} in the 1940s, and fell into decline by the 1980s with the closure of canneries and increased foreign competition. [...] For many years, the annual blessing of the fleet, seeking God's blessing for a bountiful harvest and for the fleet's safety, drew large crowds to San Pedro. [...] At its peak {{the blessing of the}} fleet drew 100,000 people and 200 fishing boats. [...] However, by 1987, the crowd gathered for the blessing had dwindled to 200 people and 16 fishing boats, as the Los Angeles Times reported that the poor turnout was [...] "a sad reminder of the story of the San Pedro {{fishing industry}}," [...] which had [...] "fallen upon stormy economic seas." [...] The blessing ceremony was also accompanied for many years by a festival that attracted up to 250,000 visitors in the late 1960s, and included a boat parade that was reportedly the second most photographed event in the nation, trailing only Pasadena's Rose Parade. [...] In 1985, Mary Star of the Sea began to offer a special fishermen's Mass on the same day as the blessing of the fleet. [...] At the 1987 fishermen's Mass, Msgr. Gallagher told the congregation: [...] "Times have changed. [...] The fishing industry is not <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> But yet we've seen this remnant of people [...] [...] [...] who adjust to the changing conditions, who persevere in the face of adversity.
