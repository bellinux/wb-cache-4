40|$|International audienceVine water {{status was}} {{measured}} on 96 blocks of three vines inside a vineyard plot of 0, 28 ha during three years: 2003, 2004 and 2005. Three physiological indicators were implemented: <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential, carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugars at ripeness (δ 13 C) and canopy temperature measured by high resolution remote sensing. For <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential, measurements were taken {{on every single}} vine of each block. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess (i) the spatial distribution of vine water status inside a vineyard plot, (ii) the temporal stability of this distribution from one date to another in the same year and (iii) the temporal stability of this distribution from one year to another. The three physiological indicators provided accurate data of vine water status, as was shown by high correlation coefficients between <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values and canopy temperature, as well as between <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential and δ 13 C. Vine water status maps obtained with either <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential data or δ 13 C data showed similar patterns of spots that were more or less affected by water deficit stress, in relation to local soil <b>water</b> holding capacity. <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> potential was measured in September 2004 on two days in a row, one cloudy day and the next day with higher temperatures and clear conditions. <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values were highly correlated between these two days, which confirms the fact that <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential is mainly influenced by soil <b>water</b> status. However, <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values were in average 0. 08 MPa higher on the cloudy day, which shows a measurable but limited influence of evaporative demand on absolute <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values. Both <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values and δ 13 C data were well correlated from one year to another, which shows a stability of spatial distribution of vine water status inside the plot. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that soil water holding capacity is invariable from one year to another. Surprisingly, <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values measured at the same time between vine 1, vine 2 and vine 3 of each block were not very well correlated, although the soil can be considered homogeneous inside a block (3 m 2).

Despite not being statistically positive, by visualizing the plots through the speeds (Fig.  3), {{it was clear}} that hip arthroplasty patients irrespective of design preferred to load the contralateral normal hip and spare the implanted side marginally during weight acceptance. Nevertheless push-off was the variable by which differences were detected (Table  2). Both the shorter and the longer stemmed groups walked with lower push-off forces than the controls on the flat. Statistical differences were found on the flat at 5  km, 5.5  km/h for the long <b>stemmed</b> <b>device</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.045, p[*]=[*] 0.049 respectively), and at 5, 5.5 and 6  km/h for the short <b>stemmed</b> <b>device</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.003, p[*]=[*] 0.007, p[*]=[*] 0.022 respectively). The weaker push-off did continue to affect uphill walking, particularly on increasing inclines, but this did not reach statistical significance. The only significant difference during uphill was found during 15 degree inclined walking where both hip replacements walked with less weight acceptance than controls (p[*]=[*] 0.03 and p[*]=[*] 0.045), short and long respectively.

40|$|Aims <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> storage plays a {{significant}} role in maintaining a favorable leaf water and carbon balance and minimizing temporal imbalances between water supply and demand. Few measurements, however, have been made on the daily dynamics of discharge and recharge of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage, especially for Chinese temperate trees. Our objectives were to (1) examine diurnal courses of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage of three temperate trees with different characteristics in Northeast China, i. e., coniferous needle-leaved Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis), broadleaved diffuse-porous aspen (Populus davidiana) and ring-porous Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), (2) quantify the contribution of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage to the daily transpiration loss for these trees and (3) explore biotic factors influencing <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage. Methods Sapflow was measured simultaneously at the crown base and trunk base with calibrated thermal dissipation probes from mid-August to late-September 2010. The daily <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage was calculated by comparing the diurnal patterns of trunk basal and crown basal sapflow for each of three replicated trees per species. Important findings Crown basal sapflow started earlier than trunk basal sapflow in the morning for all trees, and a distinct time lag existed during the daytime. This suggested <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage was significant in regulating tree transpiration losses. The diurnal course of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage was divided into four stages, i. e., full discharge, mainly discharge supplemented with recharge, mainly recharge supplemented with discharge, and saturated steady stages. However, the duration and pattern of each stage varied with species. The pine experienced two periods of discharge and recharge of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage, while the two broad-leaved species experienced only one. The daily amount of water withdrawn from storage and subsequently replaced that was normalized to the mean sapwood volume (0. 29 m 3) was (3. 4 ± 1. 5), (2. 4 ± 0. 6) and (1. 5 ± 0. 4) kg·d– 1 (mean ± SD) for the pine, aspen, and oak, respectively, accounting for 18. 9 %, 17. 1 % and 8. 8 % of the total daily water loss, respectively. Use of stem-stored water exponentially increased with daily water loss, and was positively correlated with the basal sapwood area and tree height. These results emphasize the effects of tree size (i. e., tree height and sapwood area) and timber properties on <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage and its contribution to daily water losses...|$|R
40|$|Stem or trunk {{girdling}} is {{a technique}} used in physiological studies and in horticultural practice for interrupting carbon flow through the phloem {{to other parts of}} the plant without influencing water flow in the xylem. Trunk girdling in peaches is practiced primarily to stimulate fruit growth but it also tends to decrease shoot vigour for a period of time after girdling. Water flow through the trunk or branches of peach trees is thought to be primarily dependent on the most recently formed ring of xylem and vegetative growth is closely related to <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential and <b>stem</b> hydraulic conductance. The aim of the present work was to determine whether vigour reduction due to girdling was correlated with a reduction in midday <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential during the period of time between girdling and the subsequent healing of stem tissue. 'Springcrest' peach trees were girdled on two different dates. Fruit yield and size, water sprout growth, proleptic shoot growth and <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential were measured. Early and late girdled trees yielded larger fruits and fewer and shorter water sprouts in comparison with control trees. Midday <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential declined significantly after girdling and gradually recovered until the time of fruit harvest.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of tree species from the Amazon {{whitewater}} floodplains are deciduous and show leaf shedding behavior mainly during the aquatic period. We, therefore, are hypothesizing severely physiological stress caused by anoxic conditions in the rooting environment. Those conditions are supposed to inhibit nutrient and water uptake by roots which at least leads to the reduction of transpiring surfaces via leaf shedding. The grade of root water uptake restrictions was estimated by means of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage calculations. The daily <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage was studied on different tree species throughout the terrestrial and aquatic period {{of the year in}} a secondary stage whitewater floodplain forest near Manaus, Brazil. <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> usage was calculated by simultaneous measurements of xylem sap flow at the stem base and the crown base of each model tree. Measurements were carried out by means of the "Granier-Method" using constant energy input thermal probes inserted in the sapwood. The daily <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage was calculated by comparing the time delay in <b>water</b> fluxes between <b>stem</b> base and crown base. Increasing water uptake restrictions during waterlogging are leading to a higher amount of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage in most of the deciduous species but not in the evergreen species Nectandra amazonum. During the aquatic period the daily amount of water withdrawn from the <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> store during the day and subsequently replaced during the night ranged from 0 kg d- 1 in Nectandra amazonum (evergreen) to 4. 7 kg d- 1 (22 % of total daily sap flow) in Pseudobombax munguba (deciduous). The highest amount of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage during the terrestrial period was 13 % of total transpiration observed also in Pseudobombax munguba. Although the <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> store was used to a larger extent during the aquatic period, the total sap flow rates of the terrestrial period does not significantly exceed sap flow of the aquatic period in all species. Night time was always sufficient for refilling the sap wood of the stems. We, therefore, could not verify a causal correlation between limited water supply to transpiring leaves and the observed leaf shedding of deciduous species. Leaf shedding never followed decreasing xylem water fluxes but in the opposite sap fluxes decreased simultaneously with prolonged leaf shedding. No significant pre-shedding decrease of leaf water potential could be observed in all species which indicates functioning water supply to the transpiring crown during waterlogging.
