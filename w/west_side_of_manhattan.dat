Fourteen more stations were on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), which opened in 1955. Two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were part of the Chrystie Street Connection, and opened in 1968; the Harlem–148th Street terminal opened that same year in an unrelated project. Six were built as part of a 1968 plan: three on the Archer Avenue Lines, opened in 1988, and three on the 63rd Street Lines, built in 1989.

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture and Regional & Community PlanningKatie Kingery-PageMany {{cities in}} the United States have {{developed}} into auto-dominated places with decreased accessibility for pedestrians and bleak cityscapes of wide, barrier-like streets. While many studies exist on the correlation between street width and vehicular safety, and vehicular speed and pedestrian safety, little information {{is available on the}} correlation between street width and pedestrian safety. This project began while the researcher interned with the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) Pedestrian Projects Group (PPG). The researcher was asked to begin a study of New York City (NYC) streets, specifically analyzing the relationship between street width and pedestrian safety using NYC safety data. The street types studied represent a variety of conditions found in many cities. The exploratory correlation study, completed after returning to Kansas State University, found that narrow streets trend towards higher safety. The correlation study between street width and pedestrian safety provides justification to narrow Bluemont Avenue in Manhattan, Kansas and increase pedestrian safety. Bluemont Avenue is a primary vehicular connection between the east and <b>west</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> The city’s future construction plans propose widening the street to accommodate a center turning lane along the entire length of Bluemont Avenue. The research presented in this report supports the hypothesis that narrower streets are safer for pedestrians. By utilizing the results of the study, a designer can strengthen their argument to narrow wide, auto-dominated streets. In addition, the use of a two-stage design process can create a safer environment for pedestrians on Bluemont Avenue. By utilizing a temporary design followed by a permanent installation, the City <b>of</b> <b>Manhattan</b> can decrease the priority of Bluemont Avenue within the vehicle hierarchy and increase pedestrian safety. The intent of this report is to begin a conversation with the City <b>of</b> <b>Manhattan</b> to begin looking at streets not as mere vehicular paths, but paths for all modes of transit...|$|R
