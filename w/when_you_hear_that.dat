I knew that record was gonna go just because you never heard Mariah talk about this stuff. ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side. I knew that was gonna strike people. Either it was gonna hit them in a wrong way or they was gonna love it.|$|E

Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
