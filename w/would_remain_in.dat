5|$|On 22 April 1945, at his {{afternoon}} situation conference, Hitler {{fell into}} a tearful rage (famously dramatized in the 2004 German film Downfall) when he realised that his plans, prepared the previous day, could not be achieved.

5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. It was hoped that the Japanese {{military}} would respond to these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve {{to respond to the}} planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E
5|$|At a 29 March 1965 Southeast Asia Coordinating Committee {{meeting at}} Udon Thani, Thailand {{attended}} by Ambassador Sullivan, {{representatives from the}} 2nd Air Division, MACV, and Air America, responsibilities within the Barrel Roll operational area were ironed out. Command {{and control of the}} air program <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the ambassador's hands. Operational control of U.S. air assets devolved from the commander-in-chief, Pacific Forces (CINCPAC) in Honolulu through his air deputy at Pacific Air Forces or PACAF, to the 2nd Air Division (after 1 April 1966, the Seventh Air Force).

5|$|By contrast, the Byzantine {{position}} in Southern Italy was gradually consolidated {{so that by}} 873 Bari was once again under Byzantine rule, and most of Southern Italy <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the Empire for the next 200 years.

The Paulicians were defeated and their capital of Tephrike (Divrigi) taken, while the offensive against the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of Samosata.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.|$|E
5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E

After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E

Brown <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history.

To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Octavia Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40BC. During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as Antonia the Elder and Antonia Minor).|$|E

When news reached Indiana of the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, many Indiana residents were surprised, but their response was immediate. On the following day, two mass meetings were held in Indianapolis, the state capital of Indiana, and the state's position was decided: Indiana <b>would</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the Union and would immediately contribute men to suppress the rebellion. On April 15, Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, issued a call for volunteer soldiers to meet the state's quota set by President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
