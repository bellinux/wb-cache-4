25|$|Fujiyama {{inadvertently}} attracted {{attention in}} 2000 after an article {{was published in}} the journal Neurology. The article discussed the possible relationship between riding roller coasters and the occurrence of subdural hematomas. The primary case study cited by the authors was a woman who had reported severe headaches after riding several roller coasters at Fuji-Q Highland (including Fujiyama). Upon investigation, it was discovered that this <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> in fact have a subdural hematoma. Subsequent research, however, has maintained that this risk remains low and is not unique to this particular coaster.|$|E

25|$|First and {{foremost}} in the implied Nazi doctrine concerning women was {{the notion of}} motherhood and procreation for those of child-bearing ages. The Nazi model <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not have a career, but {{was responsible for the}} education of her children and for housekeeping. Women only had a limited right to training revolving around domestic tasks, and were, over time, restricted from teaching in universities, from medical professions and from serving in political positions within the NSDAP. Many restrictions were lifted once wartime necessity dictated changes to policy later in the regime's existence.|$|E
25|$|An {{elderly woman}} {{connected}} to the shootings died from natural causes. Authorities believe the gunman started the shooting spree after finding his mother, the aforementioned elderly woman, dead on a couch from an illness for which she had been under a doctor's care, though this was unconfirmed. The disease was clarified in an autopsy to be metastatic lung cancer, although according to the woman's brother, it was breast cancer. A relative feared the <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not die from the disease, and had instead been smothered to death by Aldridge. The woman was identified as 74-year-old Alice L. Aldridge.|$|E
25|$|Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson {{argue that}} {{compared}} to other youth subcultures, the mod scene gave young women high visibility and relative autonomy. They write that this status may have been related both to {{the attitudes of the}} mod young men, who accepted the idea that a young <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not have to be attached to a man, and to the development of new occupations for young women, which gave them an income and made them more independent. Hall and Jefferson note the increasing number of jobs in boutiques and women's clothing stores, which, while poorly paid and lacking opportunities for advancement, gave young women disposable income, status and a glamorous sense of dressing up and going downtown to work.|$|E

Many restrictions were lifted once wartime necessity dictated changes to policy later in the regime's existence. With the exception of Reichsführerin Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, no women were allowed to carry out official functions, however some exceptions stood out in the regime, either through their proximity to Adolf Hitler, such as Magda Goebbels, or by excelling in particular fields, such as filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl or aviator Hanna Reitsch.|$|E
25|$|On appeal, Kennedy {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} executing a person solely for child rape, and the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the challenge {{on the grounds that}} the death penalty was not too harsh for such a heinous offense. The court distinguished the U.S. Supreme Court's plurality decision in Coker v. Georgia (1977), concluding that Cokers rejection of death as punishment for rape of an adult <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not apply when the victim was a child. Rather, the Louisiana Supreme Court applied a balancing test set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in more recent death penalty cases, Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, first examining whether there is a national consensus on the punishment and then considering whether the court would find the punishment excessive. The Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the adoption of similar laws in five other states, coupled with the unique vulnerability of children, satisfied Atkins and Roper.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{a flaw in}} the {{marriage}} ceremony {{is considered to be}} a last resort in releasing an agunah. It is rarely used as it is typically difficult in finding actual cause in most marriages to retroactively invalidate it. In Jewish law, a marriage must be performed in front of two witnesses. In order to release the agunah, efforts are made to identify reasons why one of the witnesses was ineligible. This is typically unachievable as strong efforts are made at the time of marriage to ensure the validity of the witnesses and {{the marriage}} ceremony. Another possibility is to prove that the <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not consent to the marriage clearly and of her own free will, so that the marriage ceremony is declared invalid. This too is not generally accepted amongst the halakhic authorities as there is generally no method to disprove intent. It is felt that the purpose of this endeavor is solely or primarily to retroactively delegitimize a marriage that was performed and accepted often many years previously. Annulling the marriage has no impact on the status of the woman's children. However, since it is not a generally accepted mechanism, it may leave the wife susceptible to a halakhic ruling that she was still married, and any subsequent relations with another man to be adultery. And it may lead to other halakhic problems, so it is only used as a last resort by the authorities that do accept its use.|$|E

500|$|Classical Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; rather, their mothers would have taught them {{the skills they}} would need to run a household. [...] They married young, often to much older men. [...] When they married, Athenian women had two main roles: to bear children, and to run the household. [...] The ideal Athenian <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not go out in public or interact with men she was not related to, though this ideology of seclusion would only have been practical in wealthy families. [...] In most households, women were needed to carry out tasks such as going to the market and drawing water, which required taking time outside the house where interactions with men were possible.|$|E

When the <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not show up for the interview, Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar as a typist, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, where she was stationed in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed, and she cared for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, [...] "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".|$|E

500|$|Ginsburg dissented in the Court's {{decision}} on Ledbetter v. Goodyear, , {{a case where}} plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter {{filed a lawsuit against}} her employer claiming pay discrimination based on her gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] In a 5–4 decision, the majority interpreted the statute of limitations as starting to run at the time of every pay period, even if a <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not know she was being paid less than her male colleague until later. Ginsburg found the result absurd, pointing out that women often do not know they are being paid less, and therefore it was unfair to expect them to act at the time of each paycheck. She also called attention to the reluctance women may have in male-dominated fields to making waves by filing lawsuits over small amounts, choosing instead to wait until the disparity accumulates. As part of her dissent, Ginsburg called on Congress to amend Title VII to undo the Court's decision with legislation. Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims, became law. Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.|$|E
500|$|Romanian vampires {{were known}} as moroi ( [...] from the Romanian word [...] "mort" [...] meaning [...] "dead" [...] or the Slavic word meaning [...] "nightmare") and strigoi, with the latter {{classified}} as either living or dead. Live strigoi were described as living witches with two hearts or souls, sometimes both. Strigoi {{were said to have}} the ability to send out their souls at night to meet with other strigoi and consume the blood of livestock and neighbours. Similarly, dead strigoi were described as reanimated corpses that also sucked blood and attacked their living family. Live strigoi became revenants after their death, but there were also many other ways of a person becoming a vampire. A person born with a caul, an extra nipple, a tail, or extra hair was doomed to become a vampire. The same fate applied to the seventh child in any family if all of his or her previous siblings were of the same sex, as well as someone born too early or someone whose mother had encountered a black cat crossing her path. If a pregnant <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not eat salt or was looked upon by a vampire or a witch, her child would also become a vampire. So too would a child born out of wedlock. Others who were at risk of becoming vampires were those who died an unnatural death or before baptism. Finally, a person with red hair and blue eyes was seen as a potential strigoi.|$|E
