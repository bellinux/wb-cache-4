Fiber composites have, nevertheless, a unique interaction with the externally applied load, since severe internal damage can be generated without any external sign.

40|$|Abstract- Optical fibers are {{structures}} that are typically designed to transmit energy along a specified trajectory with minimal attenuation and single distortion. Optical fibers with small losses appeared in 1970. This event has {{laid the foundation}} for modern optical communication industry. However Si waveguides have some nonlinearity which occurs when electromagnetic waves interact with core ofthe waveguide. To do away with this problem it was begun to use Optical <b>fibers</b> with helical <b>winding</b> known as complex optical waveguides. Also in conventional waveguide modes are mixed with adjacent mode if V number is greater than 2. 405. The use of helical <b>winding</b> in optical <b>fibers</b> makes the analysis much accurate. As the number of propagating modes depends on the helix pitch angle, so helical winding at core-cladding interface can control the dispersion or propagation characteristics ofthe optical waveguide. The model dispersion characteristics of circular optical waveguide with helical winding at core-cladding interface are obtained for different pitch angle. This paper gives the idea to obtain dispersion characteristics, and comparison of dispersion characteristics at different pitch angles. We obtained the dispersion characteristics by using boundary condition and this condition have been utilized to get the model Eigen values equation. From these Eigen value equations dispersion curve are obtained and plotted for five particular values of the pitch angle of the winding. Also fractional power flow in core and cladding has been calculated and the result has been compared.

40|$|Mоrphogenesis of {{intestinal}} villi {{begins in}} duodenum and passes in two stages. At first more actively proliferative and metabolic pseudostratified intestinal epithelium takes root into underlying mesenchyme, which loosens and transformates in connective tissue in this period. Together they form primary longitudinal folds of only beginner forming mucosa. Then these folds break up on typical intestinal villi. Mоrphogenesis of intestinal villi {{takes place in}} period of recanalization of duodenum, which, as mоrphogenesis of whole organ, is based on interconnections of processes, passing in its epithelial bud and surrounding mesenchyme. Intestinal epithelium exercises inductive influence on underlying mesenchyme, connecting {{with the process of}} cellular proliferation, always more intensive in epithelium. Intensive currents of epithelial metabolites erode mesenchyme. Its cells proliferites too, lose long branches and lie more and more tightly about epithelial bud of organ. Wide layer of compact mesenchyme limits external growth of epithelium, and it fills up intestinal lumen. Simultaneously capillaries narrow in thick mesenchyme, mitotic activity of epithelium and mesenchyme falls. Thin reticular, <b>winding</b> <b>fibers</b> and traces of weak sulfat glycosaminglicans appear in the mesenchyme about epithelium. Then nerve fibres and neuroblasts penetrate into intestinal wall, reticular fibers form network in mesenchyme about epithelium, capillaries widen and secondary, mitotic activity of intestinal epithelium rises. Epithelial “plugs” appear in lumen of duodenum, circular muscular layer — in external zone of its mesenchyme. After this mesenchyme mainly about epithelium produces hyaloronans and proteoglycans, bonding water. Considerable production of extracellular matrix and loosening of mesenchyme are accompanied such lowering of mitotic activity of its cells. It is beginning accelerated widening of lumen and recanalization of organ. Сircular muscular layer levels external displacements of mesenchyme with different speed on perimeter of duodenum, causing different metabolic activity of intestinal epithelium on its perimeter. In result mesenchyme redistributes in thickness of duodenal wall on its perimeter: “surplus” of mesenchyme moves from sector of more active epithelium in sector of less active epithelium, causing its delay there with lag from locus of active epithelium.
