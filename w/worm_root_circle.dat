30|$|There is a flow {{diversion}} surface with zero speed in forming the cylindrical hollow billet process, {{in which the}} material flows inwards inside the radius of the shunt circle and outwards outside the shunt circle (Ghassemali et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2014). The outside diameter of the hollow billet is smaller than the <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> of the multi-sprocket. Therefore, the upsetting process in initially filling the die cavity was ignored to facilitate analysis (Wu and Wang 1992; Yang et al. 1999). The multi-row sprocket billet was divided into 2 N deformation units and each unit (N/ 2) was subdivided into five plastic deformation zones whose boundaries were ABCDEFGHI. It was assumed that billet fluids cannot cross or shear along the symmetrical planes AB and EFG. Hence half a tooth is used to analyze deformation characteristics throughout the cold semi-precision forging process.|$|R

40|$|While {{generating}} the working profile (involute) of {{a spur gear}} using rack cutter, the root fillet curve is generated, automatically which is a trochoid. The root fillet obtained thus is not necessarily an optimum profile in context to the bending stress induced during its operation. This work investigates the stress at the gear tooth profile by replacing the conventional trochoid fillet by polynomial curves. The circular root fillet profile is constructed by drawing an arc tangent to working profiles and <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> and this arc is taken as reference root fillet to generate alternative root fillet profile. The arc is divided into six segments. New fillet profiles are constructed by displacing the middle points radially using different relations and keeping the end points fixed. The improved root fillet profiles resulted into reduction of bending stress by 9 to 12 percentage. This results presented here are based on two dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) ...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} control the quality of spline shaft in rolling process, an {{efficient}} measurement method for rolling performance evaluation is essential. Here, a newly developed on-machine non-contact measurement prototype based on laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder is proposed. The prototype is intended for the automated evaluation of the spline shaft rolling performance by measuring the dimensional change of tooth root, which is correlated with the surface residual stress and micro-hardness. Laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder are used to record the polar radius and polar angle of each point on measuring section. Data are displayed in a polar coordinate system and fitted in a gear. Through multipoint curvature method, the roots of spline shaft are recognized automatically. Then, the dimensional change can be calculated by fitting the radius of the tooth <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> before and after rolling. Systematic error covering offset error is also analyzed and calibrated. At last, measurement test {{results show that the}} system has advantages of simple structure, high measurement precision (radius error <[*] 0.6  μm), high measurement efficiency (measuring time <[*] 2  s) and automatic control ability, providing a new opportunity for the efficient evaluation of various spline shafts in high-precision mechanical processing.|$|R

Then a finite element model of a cracked gear coupled rotor system in a one-stage reduction gear box is established. The effects of crack depth, width, initial position, and crack propagation direction on gear mesh stiffness, fault features in time domain and frequency domain, and statistical indicators are investigated. Moreover, fault features are also validated by experiment. The results show that the improved mesh stiffness model is more accurate than the traditional mesh stiffness model. When the tooth root crack appears, distinct impulses are found in time domain vibration responses, and sidebands appear in frequency domain. Amplitudes of all the statistical indicators ascend gradually with the growth of crack depth and width, decrease with the increasing crack initial position angle, and firstly increase and then decrease with the growth of propagation direction angle...|$|R

40|$|The {{white and}} golden potato cyst {{nematodes}} (PCN) {{are the most}} economically important pests of potato in the UK [3]. Potato cyst nematodes originated in the Andes, where they coevolved with the potato. The earliest reports of PCN in the UK were in 1913. PCN were reported increasingly in the UK from 1920 onwards. In 1946, 20 % of the potato acreage {{was estimated to be}} infected while surveys in 1996 and 2002 determined that 42 % and 64 % of the potato fields were infested, indicating a significant recent increase in the problem [2].

Nematodes are round microscopic (. 004 -. 04 inches in length) unsegmented worms (not true <b>worms).</b> <b>Roots</b> of infected plants contain minute, white bodies of female nematodes that have erupted through the roots. When a female dies, its cuticle forms a protective cyst containing 200 to 500 eggs [1]. Cysts containing viable eggs can persist in the soil for up to twenty years. When potatoes are planted, root exudates stimulate 60 to 80 % of the juveniles to emerge from eggs. The juveniles locate and enter roots. They cut through cell walls and feed. After a final molt, the adult males emerge through the root. The females rupture the root so that their bodies protrude. They release a substance that attracts males, which mate with them repeatedly [1]. Embryos develop inside eggs into juveniles; the female...|$|R

Notable results were: 1) Potassium and nitrate movement in the medium was slower than would occur by diffusion in water; therefore, movement {{can be explained by}} diffusion alone. Lack of visible water-stress symptoms, plant height, and shoot dry weights and fresh weights indicate that water flow rates were adequate to meet the demand of plant transpiration. Populations of T. harzianum increased with increasing concentrations of K⁺ and NO₃, and populations were higher when a corn plant was present. 2) A nonwoven polypropylene fabric container physically prevented root penetration, and reduced, but did not eliminate <b>root</b> <b>circling.</b> A Cu(OH) ₂-latex paint suspension applied to the fabric containers increased root density, and improved root distribution.

40|$|Worms, {{which are}} autonomous, {{self-replicating}} malware that propagates through networks, {{can be divided}} into two categories: traditional worms, which are fully autonomous in seeking out new hosts and propagating, and mass-mailing worms, which rely on social engineering techniques and user intervention for propagation. A worm’s lifecycle can be described in four phases: initialization, payload activation, network propagation, and dormant. Each phase forms the basis of an attack, either against the victim’s machine or a separate entity. The severe economic and social consequences have prompted a significant amount of research into worm defense mechanisms. An examination of these mechanisms through the perspective of a network protocol stack illustrates two key points: 1) user education is the best defense against mass-mailing worms and their social engineering techniques, and 2) traditional worms can be dealt with at many different levels, but there are trade-offs between performance, transparency, platform dependence and availability.

40|$|Magnolia xsoulangeana, most {{commonly}} known as the Saucer Magnolia, is a small flowering tree belonging to the Magnoliaceae family. It is an interspecific hybrid of M. denudate and M. liliiflora, both of which are native to China. It is considered cold hardy through USDA Hardiness Zones 5 a, but can be found down through Zone 4 b. The tree has a rope-like root system that stays within the first 0. 3 meters of soil, and the tree prefers to grow in well-drained, moist soils. The next phase for M. xsoulangeana is to expand its market into woody decorative cuttings through sustainable greenhouse container production. Propagation would still be primarily through the use of stem cuttings, but instead of transplanting the rooted cuttings into the field the following year, they would be planted into their final containers and maintained in a greenhouse. During the winter, the greenhouse would not need to have additional lighting, and the temperatures in the greenhouse would only have to be maintained {{to the point where the}} root systems of the magnolias are not killed. Harvesting of the stems would occur in the early spring, and potentially in the summer if re-blooming types were used. In order to make this system function properly and be sustainable, breeders would need to select smaller cultivars that have a tolerance to drought. Smaller trees would make the system more manageable and give the producer the ability to maintain more trees. <b>Root</b> <b>circling</b> and girdling from the container’s restriction would also need to be overcome. Ideally, these smaller cultivars would also have smaller root systems, however it may still be necessary to use copper-coated containers, airpruning containers, or fabric containers.

Other traits that should be bred for or maintained in the cultivar include longer vase life, color variety, and growth rate, the ability to re-bloom, and higher quality second blooms...|$|R
