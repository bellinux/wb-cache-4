40|$|AbstractA finite graph Γ is ‘pair-symmetric’ if Aut Γ acts transitively {{on each of}} the {{following}} four sets of ordered pairs of vertices: (i) edges <b>which</b> <b>lie</b> in a triangle, (ii) edges <b>which</b> <b>lie</b> in no triangle, (iii) non-edges <b>which</b> <b>lie</b> in a cotriangle, (iv) non-edges <b>which</b> <b>lie</b> in no cotriangle. A pair-symmetric graph Γ is vertex-transitive, so the definition implies that Aut Γ has rank ⩽ 5 on vertices. It turns out that Aut Γ has rank ⩽ 4, and nearly always has rank 3. We show that, {{with the exception of one}} (possibly empty) family of graphs, either Aut Γ has rank ⩽ 3 on vertices, or Γ is obtained in a natural way from certain distance-transitive antipodal coverings of complete graphs...|$|R
