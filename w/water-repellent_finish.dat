40|$|Water {{repellency}} is {{a common}} requirement for textiles. Most outwear garments, tents, and bags require a durable <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finish,</b> or DWR. Some specifications often require these end items to pass multiple home launderings tests, which can be expensive {{in terms of time}} and resources. The present study sought to determine a combination of factors in an accelerated laundering test that correlated with the water and oil repellency ratings from a top-loader washing machine. Testing rounds were created based on AATCC Test Method 61 : Colorfastness to Accelerated Laundering. Samples were then washed twenty cycles and tested to AATCC Test Method 22 and AATCC Test Method 118. Once the results were not correlating with the top-loading results after the round, one of the following conditions were adjusted: amount of liquor (detergent), quantity of steel balls, and temperature. To determine the effect of the alteration, the laundry cycles and tests were run again after the change. Several preliminary studies were performed to determine the evenness of color loss, the evenness of the <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finish,</b> and if residual detergent was affecting the water and oil repellency ratings. ^ Results showed that changing the conditions in the Launder-Ometer affects the durability of water-repellent finishes on 70 denier nylon fabric. None of these condition combinations produced both water and oil test results consistent with home laundering in top-loader washing machines. Further research is needed using different fabrics and DWRs to determine if finish durability testing with a Launder-Ometer is incapable of reliably correlating with results from home launderings. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of the cotton fabric with water-repellence finishing by sol method with the hexadecyltrimethoxysilane as additive were observed. The cotton fabrics were immersed in the prepared sols with double dip and double nip dried at 90 °C, annealed at 160 °C for 3 min. The water repellence and the physical properties such as gas permeability, bending properties, beetling properties, tensile strength, elongation at break, abrasion resistance, and anti-crease {{properties of}} the cotton fabrics were investigated. The results showed that anti-crease and tensile strength were improved. However, the abrasion resistance of the cotton fabrics decreased in some way. Both the bending and beetling properties measurement proved that {{the handle of the}} treated cotton fabrics changed stiffness. For the dyed fabrics by the <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finishing,</b> the hue was slightly changed, the deeper color was achieved. There is no adverse effect for treated fabric by <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finishing</b> on the fastness. Sol–gel process, <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finishing,</b> hexadecyltrimethoxysilane, fabric properties, cotton...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} cotton textile was {{modified}} {{to create a}} <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finishing</b> by depositing a modifying coatings using the sol-gel technique. Treated textiles evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD). The wettability of treated fabrics was characterized by water contact angle and drop test. The {{results showed that the}} cotton textile treated with 7. 5 wt. % zinc acetate dihydrate sol showed excellent hydrophobic properties, water contact angle could reach 145 °C without decreasing after 50 hydrothermal treatment cycles...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} factor in high performance sportswear is the thermo-physiological wear comfort. The sportswear {{is responsible to}} support the thermal comfort of the wearer and consequently the thermoregulation, which means helping in body’s heat regulation by maintaining the skin temperature of 33 °C and body’s core temperature of 37 °C. Each sport has its own requisites and rowing is no exception. In the following investigation there were examined three different groups of <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finished</b> functional rowing shirts, featuring different knitting structures. The shirts were tested in a climatic chamber with a thermal manikin under constant conditions and afterwards analyzed using infrared thermography. The objective was {{to find out which}} sample shirts and knitting structures provide the best performance under different environmental conditions. FC...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} cotton (COT) and {{polyester}} (PET) fabrics was modified {{to create a}} <b>water-repellent</b> <b>finishing</b> by depositing a modified silica-based film using the sol-gel technique. TEOS (tetraethoxysilane) -based physically modified sols with 2 % and 11 % on weight fabric (o. w. f.) of hydrophobic additives were tested. N-propyltrimethoxysilane (C 3), hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (C 16) and 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-fluorooctyltriethoxysilane (FOS) were investigated as additives. Furthermore, a low-temperature plasma pre-treatment was used to activate the COTand PET fabric surface to improve the sol-gel coating adhesion, resistance to abrasion and fastness to washing stresses. A complete chemical/morphological (Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy) and physical characterization (abrasion and air permeability test) of treated samples was carried out. High values of y (around 140) on PET and COT samples were obtained with all additives used (C 3, C 16 and FOS) even at a low concentration (2 %). Due to plasma pre-treatment, interesting water-repellent properties were achieved for PET (y¼ 148) treated with TEOS/FOS molar ratio 0. 63 and for COT (y¼ 140) with TEOS/C 16 molar ratio 0. 63. The enhanced coating adhesion, due to plasma surface activation, was confirmed by abrasion and washing test...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Lotus leaf {{structures}} shows shelf-cleaning {{properties of}} water-repellent, it’s convenient to clean, especially the interior decoration materials. Polyester sea-island ultra-fine fiber {{was chosen as}} raw materials, the crepe weave {{was used as the}} organization structure, and finally through <b>water-repellent</b> nano-coating <b>finishing</b> to form a Lotus leaf-like surface, then the water repellency, the anti-fouling performance and the anti-ultraviolet performance of lotus-leaf-like materials was tested and analyzed. The conclusions drawn are as follows: the water repellency, the anti-fouling performance and the anti-ultraviolet performance of lotus-leaf-like decoration materials was excellent, the UV transmission of the materials was only 2 %, which was far below the International standard {{and at the same time}} the results shows that the materials had good wrinkle resistance property, it can improve the structure stability...|$|R
