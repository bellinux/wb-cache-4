500|$|Returning {{to music}} in 1968, Presley {{included}} the song on his playlist for the NBC special Elvis and performed it live {{the following year}} during his first Las Vegas engagement. A version of the song, recorded on August 26 and documenting Presley altering {{the words of the}} narration ("Do you gaze at your bald head and <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> hair") and laughing {{through the rest of the}} bridge, was released in 1980 as part of the Elvis Aron Presley box set. In 1982 this [...] "laughing version" [...] was a radio hit in the United Kingdom and reached number 25 on the British Singles Chart. Presley included the song in his 1972 documentary, Elvis on Tour, and the 1977 CBS special Elvis in Concert.|$|E
500|$|Around midday, Rupert {{was joined}} on Marston Moor by Newcastle, {{accompanied}} by a mounted troop of [...] "gentleman volunteers" [...] only. Rupert greeted him by saying, [...] "My Lord, I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come sooner with your forces, but I hope we shall yet have a glorious day." [...] Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies, with separate garrisons, recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect, would eventually separate. He also suggested waiting for a force of 3,000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2,000 to join the Royalist army. Rupert was adamant that the King's letter (which he never showed to Newcastle) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately. Furthermore, Rupert wished {{to compensate for the}} Royalists' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares, and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers.|$|E
500|$|Another {{execution}} {{was staged}} as a cruel {{twist on the}} story of Orpheus, who supposedly charmed the plants and flowers with his song after he lost Eurydice. In the version presented at the inaugural games, the tree and animals were charmed just as in the story, except for an [...] "unappreciative" [...] bear which tore the minstrel to pieces. It is likely that the harmless creatures were released first to give the impression of the story proceeding as planned before the bear was released to dispatch the unfortunate criminal forced into the role of Orpheus, whose probable restraint prevented him fleeing. Ironic reinterpretations of the myths may have been popular: in addition to Orpheus' failure to charm the beasts, Martial mentions [...] "Daedalus" [...] being torn apart by another bear, mocking him with the words [...] "how you must <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> your feathers now".|$|E

500|$|On February 12, with {{insufficient}} cash {{to pay his}} overdue {{rent and}} a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him, Bundy stole a car and fled Tallahassee, driving westward across the Florida Panhandle. Three days later, at around 1:00a.m., he was stopped by Pensacola police officer David Lee near the Alabama state line after a [...] "wants and warrants" [...] check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen. When told he was under arrest, Bundy kicked Lee's legs {{out from under him}} and took off running. Lee fired a warning shot followed by a second round, gave chase and tackled him. The two struggled over Lee's gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested Bundy. In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students, 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set. Also found were a pair of dark-rimmed non-prescription glasses and a pair of plaid slacks, later identified as the disguise worn by [...] "Richard Burton, Fire Department" [...] in Jacksonville. As Lee transported his suspect to jail, unaware that he had just arrested one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, he heard Bundy say, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> killed me." ...|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had,</b> you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..." [...] Views on one, the early-in-show, eight-minute [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] – one of the few new material centerpieces – varied considerably.|$|E

2500|$|In 1745, Sackville wrote {{a letter}} to the Duke of Richmond after Sussex had lost to Surrey and said: [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> let Ridgeway play instead of your stopper behind it might have turned the match in our favour". Evidently, Sackville had wagered on Sussex to win.|$|E
2500|$|One of the wives—station wagon, three children, forty-five-thousand-dollar house—leaned {{over and}} said, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> spit {{in his face}} for me." [...] It was a {{stunning}} moment; I wondered {{for a long time}} afterwards what King could possibly have done to her, in what conceivable way he could have threatened her, why this passionate hate.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1745, Richmond backed a Sussex XI against Surrey in a {{match at}} Berry Hill, near Arundel. It appears that Surrey {{won the game}} in view of a comment made by Lord John Philip Sackville {{in a letter to}} Richmond dated Saturday 14 September: [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> let Ridgeway play instead of your stopper behind it might have turned the match in our favour".|$|E

2500|$|Charles Lamb did {{not like}} the changes {{incorporated}} in the 1796 edition of [...] "Monody" [...] and told Coleridge [...] "I rather <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> left the monody on Chatterton concluding as it did abruptly. It had more of unity" [...] and, later, [...] "I am not quite satisfied with the Chatterton, and with your leave shall try my hand at it again. A master joiner, you know, may leave a cabinet to be finished, when his own hands are full" [...] but Coleridge refused any of his suggestions.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living. It recommends contacting a medical professional if [...] "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life." [...] Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: [...] "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost your sense of purpose in life, <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> died along with your loved one." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Chris Watters scored it 6.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Deadlight draws you in {{with its}} rich, {{pervasive}} atmosphere, but doesn't give you {{much to do}} once you're there", calling the game [...] "an alluringly dark, but disappointingly shallow experience." [...] He praised the graphics, arguing [...] "the artistic elements work in harmony to make Deadlight a visually compelling game." [...] However, he was critical of the gameplay, writing [...] "linearity isn't inherently negative, but performing the same few moves to progress down a clearly marked path doesn't hold its appeal for long." [...] He concluded [...] "In the three or so hours {{that it takes to}} complete the game, you feel less like you are trekking through a dangerous world, and more like you are acting out a script. Deadlights engrossing visuals make it fun to play the part, but you'll <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> more lines." ...|$|E
