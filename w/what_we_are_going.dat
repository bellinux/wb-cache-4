500|$|Koppelman was {{an early}} student of Aesthetic Realism, the {{philosophy}} founded in 1941 by Eli Siegel, {{which is based on}} the principle, [...] "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> after in ourselves". This principle informed Koppelman's art, teaching, and his work as an Aesthetic Realism consultant. About the importance of this principle to art and life, Koppelman stated, [...] "When Eli Siegel showed that what makes a work of art beautiful [...] the oneness of opposites [...] is the same as what every individual wants, {{it was one of the}} mightiest and kindest achievements of man's mind".|$|E

[...] "We've told them we are not prepared to do that until they give up their nuclear materials", said Hill. [...] "We can begin the process of discussing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do, whether we are going to open embassies, that sort of thing. But we will not have diplomatic relations with a nuclear North Korea." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, deputy New Zealand First {{party leader}} Peter Brown drew {{widespread}} attention after voicing similar views and expressing concern at {{the increase in}} New Zealand's ethnic Asian population: [...] "We are going to flood this country with Asian people with no idea <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to do with them}} when they come here." [...] "The matter is serious. If we continue this open door policy there is real danger we will be inundated with people who have no intention of integrating into our society. The greater the number, the greater the risk. They will form their own mini-societies to the detriment of integration and that will lead to division, friction and resentment." ...|$|E

"Louise and Mrs. Hilary {{sent their}} love, {{and they all}} want to do {{anything}} they can; and--and I told Mr. Hilary <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to try; and--he said he would speak to his father about it; and--Oh, Suzette, I'm afraid I've done more than I ought!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to think <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do." ...|$|E

5000|$|Yeah, that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{trying to}} go for there, {{and then with the}} bridge, bring it up, like the sun is rising, like we're coming out of the dark, that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> for when {{recording}} that.

6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{have set}} our minds on, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to save up our money to get, was a piano for George's mother.

6000|$|... 'Grandfather, don't look {{at those}} I talk of, and don't seem as if I spoke of {{anything}} but what I am about. What was that you told me before we left the old house?

60|$|He persuaded me at last, {{but that}} boy watched {{us like a}} cat {{watching}} a couple of canaries, and I could see we should 'ave all {{we could do to}} deceive 'im.

60|$|Our {{greatest}} trouble, that evening, {{was to make}} a fire. The wood, {{of which}} there was a good deal lying about under the trees, was now all wet and would not burn. However, we managed to get up a fire in the stove, but I did not know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do in the morning. We should have stored away some wood under shelter.|$|R
6000|$|Our poet {{has been}} rigidly suppressed, {{from the time}} we let go the anchor. When it <b>was</b> {{announced}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to visit the Emperor of Russia, the fountains of his great deep were broken up, and he rained ineffable bosh for four-and-twenty hours. Our original anxiety as to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do with ourselves, was suddenly transformed into anxiety about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do with our poet. The problem was solved at last. Two alternatives were offered him--he must either swear a dreadful oath that he would not issue a line of his poetry {{while he was in the}} Czar's dominions, or else remain under guard on board the ship until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> safe at Constantinople again. He fought the dilemma long, but yielded at last. It was a great deliverance. Perhaps the savage reader would like a specimen of his style. I do not mean this term to be offensive. I only use it because [...] "the gentle reader" [...] has been used so often that any change from it can not but be refreshing: ...|$|R

5000|$|The idea {{of doing}} 'Can't Hurry Love' {{was to see}} if Hugh Padgham and I could {{duplicate}} that Sixties sound. It's very difficult today because most recording facilities {{are so much more}} sophisticated than they were back then. It's therefore hard to make the drums sound as rough as they did on the original. That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> after, a remake, not an interpretation, but a remake.|$|R
60|$|We three--Corny, Rectus and I--were {{agreed that}} the re-enthronement--we {{could think of no}} better word for the business--should be done as quietly and peacefully as possible. It was of no use, we thought, to make a great fuss about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do. <b>We</b> would see that this African ex-sovereigness was placed in a {{suitable}} regal station, and then we would call upon her countrymen to acknowledge her rank.|$|R

5000|$|When Fabian's father {{returned}} from hospital {{he was unable}} to work, so when Marcucci persisted, Fabian and his family were amenable and he agreed to record a single.

[...] "He was the right look and right for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> for", wrote Marcucci later.|$|R
5000|$|Riot police {{eventually}} {{shut down}} the protest, arresting dozens. Some protesters claimed excessive force {{on the part of}} the police.

The police threatened to use chemical agents and impact weapons if the protesters did not disperse. [...] Ultimately, though, the eviction was less violent than in other cities.
