5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when <b>we</b> <b>met.</b> It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor portrayed {{a prostitute}} in the 2004 drama Chameli, which {{proved to be}} a turning point in her career, earning her a Special Performance Award at Filmfare.

5|$|Kapoor's {{personal}} {{life is the}} subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of Fida in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set of pictures of them kissing in public. Despite claims by the couple that the pictures were fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab <b>We</b> <b>Met.</b> Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his {{personal life}} away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} acting {{debut in the}} 2000 war film Refugee, Kapoor {{established}} herself in Hindi cinema with roles in the historical drama Aśoka, and the blockbuster melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (both 2001). This initial success {{was followed by a}} series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews. The year 2004 marked a turning point for Kapoor when she played against type in the role of a sex worker in the drama Chameli. She subsequently earned wide critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot victim in the 2004 drama Dev and a character based on William Shakespeare's heroine Desdemona in the 2006 crime film Omkara. She went on to receive Filmfare Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for her performances in the 2007 romantic comedy Jab <b>We</b> <b>Met</b> and the 2010 drama We Are Family, respectively. Kapoor achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in two of India's top-grossing productions—the 2009 comedy-drama 3 Idiots and the 2015 social drama Bajrangi Bhaijaan—and received praise for her roles in the 2009 thriller Kurbaan and the 2012 drama Heroine.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor {{made his}} film debut in 2003 with {{a leading role}} in the romantic comedy Ishq Vishk, a sleeper hit for which he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He {{followed}} it with roles in several commercial failures before starring in Sooraj Barjatya's top-grossing family drama Vivah (2006). Kapoor earned nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for portraying a troubled businessman in Imtiaz Ali's romantic comedy Jab <b>We</b> <b>Met</b> (2007) and twin brothers in Vishal Bhardwaj's caper thriller Kaminey (2009). After appearing in another series of box office flops, he starred in the action film R... Rajkumar (2013)his highest-grossing release. In 2014, Kapoor portrayed the Hamlet character in Bhardwaj's acclaimed drama Haider, for which he won the Best Actor award at Filmfare.

5|$|The male lead of Rockstar {{is played}} by Ranbir Kapoor, with whom Eros International worked {{previously}} on Anjaana Anjaani. His role of Jordan is loosely based on Imtiaz Ali's Jat friend, {{who lived in a}} small settlement in Pitam Pura. He had seen Kareena Kapoor's performance in his Jab <b>We</b> <b>Met</b> and wanted to cast her in the film. However, the script required some romantic scenes between the leads. As Ranbir and Kareena happened to be cousins, this was touted as a problem. Moreover, the filmmakers did not want to replace Ranbir with any other actor as the character he portrayed was reportedly suitable only for him. They then made a joint decision to replace Kapoor with Nargis Fakhri, after initially approaching Sonam Kapoor and Diana Penty for the replacement. Voice actor Mona Ghosh Shetty dubbed for Fakhri. The film marked Shammi Kapoor's last appearance in a feature film; he died on 14 August 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time <b>we</b> <b>met</b> him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
