Thomas arrived in Baltimore with his family in June of that year, confronting a severe housing shortage and a level of racism worse than they had endured in Nashville. Hopkins, like the rest of Baltimore, was rigidly segregated, and the only black employees at the institution were janitors. When Thomas walked the halls in his <b>white</b> <b>lab</b> <b>coat,</b> many heads turned. He began changing into his city clothes when he walked from the laboratory to Blalock's office because he received so much attention.|$|E

He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to [...] "carry the one" [...] in various mathematical calculations. When he rambles he often speaks incoherently in run-on sentences without pauses.

Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the CBS Reports TV special [...] "The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson" [...] that aired April 3, 1963.

[...] Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the President's Science Advisory Committee. Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.|$|E
500|$|The {{time machine}} gets {{destroyed}} {{so the two}} Candaces go to the backyard to convince the boys to fix the current time machine in the museum and take them back, creating a paradox and as a result, the Candace from the bleak future(wearing a <b>white</b> <b>lab</b> <b>coat</b> {{as seen in the}} picture above) ceases to exist. The boys then fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a bonus. The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace [...] "finally" [...] busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry at the boys, saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore). As Candace and the boys talk to the future Linda, Isabella sparks an idea and travels back in time. After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that she had finally (but not technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change their minds about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop). In [...] "Summer Belongs To You", Phineas mentions time traveling twice and Isabella comments that Phineas has traveled through time [...] "twice", but because of the events in the credits of Quantum Boogaloo, no-one - including Isabella [...] should actually know about the time-traveling.|$|E

40|$|Students {{have been}} {{reported}} to have stereotypical views of scientists as middle-aged <b>white</b> men in <b>lab</b> <b>coats.</b> We argue that a way to provide students with a more realistic view of scientists and their work is to provide them with the opportunity to interact with scientists during short, discussion-based sessions. For that reason, 20 scientists from 8 professional areas were asked to share their experiences of becoming and being a scientist, in short sessions with groups of 7 – 8 students. The student sample consisted of 223 students between 13 and 15 years. Student and scientist questionnaires were used before and after the sessions to assess students’ views of scientists and their work, and scientists’ experiences of interacting with students. The pre-session questionnaires revealed that students considered scientists as ‘boring’ and ‘nerdy’ whereas after the sessions students focused extensively on how ‘normal’ the scientists appeared to be. The face-to-face interactions with scientists allowed students to view scientists as approachable and normal people, and to begin to understand the range of scientific areas and careers that exist. Scientists viewed the scientist–student interactions as a vehicle for science communication. Implications discussed include the need for future training courses to focus on developing science communicators’ questioning and interaction skills for effective interactions with students...|$|R
