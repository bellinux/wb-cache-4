40|$|The paper {{presents}} a two-stage simplified method for the simulation of comminution process {{which takes place}} in a <b>beater</b> <b>mill.</b> The first stage of the proposed method is a simulation of the flow of gas and ore particles through a mill based on a two-phase continuous-discrete model. It allows to capture the interaction between the fluid flow and embedded particles, to determine trajectories of their motion and average velocities and frequencies of their collisions against the flywheel and the mill's walls. The second stage of the proposed method is a discrete element method simulation of the process of comminution of a single ore particle. It allows to determine the size distribution of created smaller particles in terms of normal velocity and angle of impact and to estimate the global efficiency of the comminution process. The proposed simulation methodology is applied for the verification of the innovative concept of the application of high–speed <b>beater</b> <b>mill</b> for the comminution of the copper ore...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} {{efficiency}} of application of magneto-fluidized bed formed of ferromagnetic materials in press-forms dosed filling and milling devices. For powders without natural fluidity, dosing device is situated between electromagnets creating constant magnetic field with horizontal induction lines and alternating gradient magnetic field with vertical induction lines and higher induction gradient in the lowest part of chamber with powder. This configuration allows development of uniform efflux speed of ferromagnetic powders from 2 mm diameter opening. For example, mass efflux speed of strontium ferrite powder with 1 μm average particle size in magneto-fluidized bed reached 181. 1 mg/s and the dosing time of 2000 mg of this powder was 11. 1 s. For practical usage of magneto-fluidized bed in the <b>milling</b> device, <b>beater</b> <b>mill</b> is situated between electromagnet poles {{in the way that}} induction lines of constant and alternating gradient magnetic fields were mutually perpendicular and parallel to the plane of rotating <b>beaters.</b> <b>Milling</b> of particulate strontium ferrite with 1558. 5 μm average particle size during 120 minutes in magneto-fluidized bed allows increasing milling degree in 16. 2 times by comparison with processing without electromagnetic effect...|$|R

P. C.) for the pulverization and drying of lignite. An analysis of the particle motion characteristics and the adopted scaling down procedure for the design of the model mill, which retains geometrical and fluid dynamic similarity, are presented. The real and model <b>beater</b> wheel <b>mills</b> are described and the simplifications adopted are discussed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Impaction bone {{grafting}} with large particles is considered as mechanically superior to smaller morsels. Interest of freeze-dried irradiated bone for impaction {{bone grafting}} {{has been observed}} with small particles. Influence of bone process on other particle sizes still needed to be assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four osteoarthrotic femoral heads were used to prepare fresh-frozen and freeze-dried irradiated cancellous bone. Each group was divided into four batches of different particle sizes, each batch containing 18 samples. The different particle sizes were obtained with a Retsch Cross <b>Beater</b> <b>Mill</b> SK 100, Noviomagus rotating bone mills with two sizes of rasps and a Luer bone rongeur. Bone grafts were impacted in a contained cylinder. Stiffness was monitored during impaction. RESULTS: Freeze-dried irradiated grafts showed higher stiffness than fresh-frozen bone whatever {{the size of the}} particles. Large particles obtained with the rongeur and the large rasp from the Noviomagus bone mill were mechanically superior than small particles up to 30 impactions. INTERPRETATION: Large particles offer better mechanical performance as a greater magnitude of force would be required to deform and break the particles. Freeze-dried irradiated bone brittleness reduces this advantage after 30 impactions. Large particles embrittlement leads to similar mechanical results as small particles at higher impaction rate. This may account for partial collapse of the graft layer in clinical situation when impaction rate is lower. This model supports the use of small particles obtained with thin rasp bone mill when freeze-dried irradiated bone for impaction bone grafting and large particles obtained with the Rongeur when fresh-frozen bone is available...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} presented for a two-dimensional simulation {{of the gas}} flow field and of the dynamic behavior of lignite particles inside <b>Beater</b> Wheel <b>mills</b> with classifier, installed in large coal-fired plants. A large number of representative particles are tracked using Lagrangian equations of motion, in combination with a stochastic model for particle turbulent dispersion. All the important mechanisms associated with the particle motion through the mill (particle-surface collisions and rebounding phenomena, fuel moisture evaporation and erosion wear of internal surfaces) are modeled. A special model is constructed to simulate the fragmentation of impacting particles and to calculate the size distribution of the final mill product. The models are regulated {{on the basis of}} available data from grinding mills of the Greek lignite power stations. The numerical code is capable of predicting the locations of significant erosion and to estimate the amount of particle mass that circulates through the mill via the classifying chamber. Mean impact velocity and impingement angle distributions along all the internal surfaces are also provided. The results indicate remarkable differences in the extent of the erosion caused at different locations of the mill. Also, the significant role of the leading blades arrangement inside the classifier on its classification performance and efficiency is elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Various {{comparative}} studies into the biological activity and relative toxicity of cubozoan venoms have been investigated, {{in particular the}} venom from the potentially lethal cubozoan Chironex fleckeri. Efficient and reliable extraction of venom from nematocysts is essential before any research into venom toxicity can be conducted and previous cited methods of extraction have varied greatly, each with their own associated problems. A new standardised technique for the recovery of venom from nematocysts of cubozoans is investigated to decrease the variation displayed between authors due to differing extraction techniques. The use of a mini bead <b>mill</b> <b>beater,</b> as investigated in this trial, allows for the rapid extraction of venom from nematocysts and is devoid of the previously isolated problems experienced with other methods of venom isolation, such as excessive heat build up...|$|R
50|$|Grain to be {{processed}} into flour is first ground, typically {{in one or more}} steps, then the bran is separated from the flour produced by grinding the grain. The flour produced from the grain is further separated by size through sifting (or bolting). A centrifugal reel or flour dresser is used to perform this separation, producing the finished flour and a number of byproducts, such as bran and dust. A centrifugal reel is a cylinder which a cloth filter is stretched. Inside of the cloth-covered cylinder are beaters which stir and toss the ground grain against the cloth. A brush moving across the outside of the cylinder removes the flour and keeps the cloth functioning. A flour dresser is constructed similarly to the centrifugal reel, but lacks the <b>beaters.</b> A typical <b>mill</b> process involves passing the flour coming off the millstones through successive dressers so as to achieve optimum separation of flour from bran and germ components of the grain.|$|R
40|$|Lignite {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Greece's energy sector as it satisfies over 70 % of country's needs in electric power. The extraction of lignite takes place mainly in three regions of Greece, namely Ptolemais-Amyndeon, Megalopolis and Florina. The annual production of lignite is around 60 million tons, out of which 48 million tons derive from the coal fields of northern Greece (Ptolemais-Amyndeon and Florina). Almost the entire lignite production is consumed for electricity generation, while small amounts of lignite are used for briquettes and other applications. The Greek coal-fired power plants, which are about 4500 MW, use conventional technology and they are old (an average of 30 years). In the coming years new coal fields will be exploited in Florina-another 2. 5 million tons of coal-in order to satisfy the currently under construction 365 MW plant located at Meliti, Florina, Northern Greece. Even though the lignite reserves are widespread in Greece and other areas such as Elassona and Drama could possibly host power plants, it is expected that the Florina power plant will be the last coalfired plant to be build in the country. Lignite has to compete with natural gas-the construction of the main gas pipeline network has been completed-imported oil and renewable energy sources. The new EU regulations on power plant emissions raise obstacles for the firing of lignite, although it is low in sulphur. It must be shown that lignite produces low cost electricity in a environmentally friendly manner. The utilization of fly ash and land reclamation can improve the situation in lignite mining. In particular, specific attention was paid to further research and potential use of fly ash in road construction, the production of bricks and concrete, and the production of zeolites from lignitic fly ash. The use of clean coal technologies in power plants can solve many emission problems. Specific measures to increase the efficiency of lignite-fired power units might include: identification of the loss sources of every unit, improvement of the cold end of the steam turbines, optimization of the <b>beater</b> wheel <b>mills</b> operation, and the combination of natural gas-fired turbines with the existing boilers. The liberalization of the electricity market needs to be considered seriously from the lignite industry, since the potential electricity producers can freely choose from all kinds of fuels, such as imported coal, oil, gas and renewables. However, Greek lignite meets the requirements for the security of supply, as indicated in the EU's Green Paper. It needs only to be competitive in the new energy sector by improving mining and combustion conditions. Further research on these topics, through the European Commission's ECSC and Framework Programmes, as well as the national programmes, is required. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} {{work had}} {{the intention to}} show that the sampling uncertainty (after Baule and Benedetti Pichler) depends also substantially on the analysis uncertainty. This is valid in particular for ICP-OES analysis and grain size analysis. According to the standard ISO 11466 accomplished, the sample preparation measures and following measurements according to standard ISO 11885 were evaluated. Primarily the elements Zn, Pb (easy in aqua regia extractable elements) and Cr (as moderately well extractable element, since spinels and chrome complexes are not completely soluble) were examined. First 25 ground samples were taken out of an almost rectangular agrarian used area (30 cm pass depth, surface). Every sample was divided in 4 parallel samples and after aquae regiae explanation (extraction) the parameters specified above were analyzed with ICP-OES and AAS methods. Also the grain size, the most important parameter of the Baule and Benedetti Pichler equation, was examined on the basis one „pebble model“. Furthermore with consideration of all results the two-dimensional analysis of variance with results of the sampling uncertainty after Baule and Benedetti Pichler were compared. It could be ascertained that the measurement uncertainty of the individual measurements of the densities, concentrations, masses, when part of the sampling uncertainty have a larger influence than assumed, depending on which test and/or evaluation procedure is used. The result of the estimation of a complete uncertainty evaluation proven that the combined uncertainty have been estimated between 37 % and 70 % of the measured element content. Amounts to the complete uncertainty evaluation, the analytical part of the uncertainty estimation could be calculated between 30 % and 92 %, followed from „on-Site“- uncertainties. Also so-called „Hot-Spots” could be recognized. For this reason a statistic definition was compiled. These unusually increased element contents in soil have a significant influence on the evaluation element contents of the entire field. The estimation of the sampling uncertainty after the Baule and Benedetti Pichler equation with contents of 10 - 200 mg/kg element in soil and grain sizes upto max. 30 µm is neglegtible uP (rel). The results were calculated to be < 0, 8 %. Only element contents of 1 mg/kg to under 0, 01 mg/kg element in soil cause relative sampling uncertainties of 3 % to 23 %. Also during the evaluation of the calibration of ICP-OES analytical methods, whether calibration curves were calibrated with reference materials or reference standards, {{it turned out that the}} calibration uncertainty become clearly smaller, if the calibration with reference material was accomplished. The uncertainty component of the reference material is already calculated, this is related however by the estimation of uncertainty of an independent standard (reference material) again in the future. The evaluated uncertainty compounts of the analytical parameter of the Baule and Benedetti Pichler equation related to the concerning elements (here Zn, Cr and Pb) between 19, 1 % and 55, 3 % related to the total result. With a grain size of 0, 2 cm uP amounts for example for Pb approx. 350 %, with equal large analytic uncertainty components of the Baule and Benedetti Pichler equation. The uncertainty of the AAS-results between the samples (grindled and original samples) habe nearly the same results as with the worked on the original soil samples. The results justify a simplified sample pretreatment, for example with the help of a cross- or rotor <b>beater</b> <b>mill,</b> without fine grinding. The results permits also the use of fine original soil for direct contamination-free sample preparation steps. For the resulting uncertainties of the original soil sample material - without Hot-Spots - any more than 25 % larger uncertainty were not determined contrary to the grindled samples of approx. 5 % (ICP data) to approx. 15 % by the average value of the soil samples. For this reason the direct use of the soil sample material is recommended with grain sizes of max. 150 µm. One of the aims of this work was also to avoid an uncritical use of formulas for the estimation of the deterministic sampling uncertainty of these authors (Baule and Benedetti-Pichler, Wilson, Ingamells). An uncritical use of the formulas leads to undefinite and non-validable results. The uncertainty concept makes it possible, that for all analytical processes an evaluation of the results with the help of the calculated confidence interval which can be calculated under consideration of all single analytical processes. It could be stated that the fact that the analytical components of the measurement uncertainty, a part of the sampling uncertainty with 30 %- 90 % has a larger influence than so far assumed depending on which test and/or evaluation procedure is used. As an important result of this work the mathematical presentation of the term of a sampling quality characterisation number is introduced. It will be calculated as „apparent variance“ as a product of the result of sampling uncertainty after the Baule and Benedetti-Pichler equation and the result of the „corner value calculation” (similar to an estimation of a rectangle distribution), multiplied by the quotient from other distributions (Gaussian distribution). To the analysed mass of soil, it can be postulated as a result of the presented work: It proves for the equation of Baule and Benedetti-Pichler as more important (more critical) point. Increasing the proportion for the preparation of the analysis samples reduces the sampling uncertainty and analysis uncertainty of the specimen. After Baule and Benedetti-Pichler also the division ratio is important apart from the particle relationship. The use of a less soil sample quantity for the extraction procedere (with the same final soluble metal concentration in the extract), will increase the Hot-Spot risk. Also the criteria of the grain size, an important parameter of the Baule and Benedetti Pichler equation, was examined. For this reason a so called “Pebble-Model" was developed and in the context of this work presented...|$|R
