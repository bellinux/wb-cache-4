5|$|Air {{contains}} <b>water</b> <b>vapor,</b> and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing <b>water</b> <b>vapor.</b> The impact event did not produce any detectable <b>water</b> <b>vapor,</b> and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of <b>water</b> <b>vapor.</b>|$|E

The treatment promotes decreasing the crystallinity of the cellulose with up to 45 % and possible imidazolium moieties grafting to cellulose, as demonstrated from FTIR, XRD, and elemental analysis. The grafting determines <b>water</b> <b>vapors</b> uptake values with 50 – 70 % lower and <b>water</b> <b>vapors</b> uptake rate with 50 % {{lower than those of}} reference cellulose nanofibers. The grafting determined also improved adhesion of the cellulose nanofibers to HDPE, thus contributing to the obtaining of polymer matrix composites with improved properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{public attention}} on the waste pollution and the awareness of the hard environmental problems {{is the reason for}} the need of new materials which are susceptible to degradation in nature {{for a short period of}} time. The biopolymer films and coatings based on renewable natural sources are suitable for obtaining of biodegradable packaging. The newly developed composite films based on sodium alginate and apple high methoxyl pectin were studied for total soluble matter, swelling in <b>water,</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapors</b> transmission rate and biodegradation in soil. The analysis of their behavior in water medium showed a considerably higher rate and degree of dissolution of the pectin monocomponent film compared to the composite and alginate films. The composite alginate-pectin films showed lower <b>water</b> <b>vapors</b> transmission rate even under extreme conditions (38 ºC, RH 90 %) compared to the monocomponent films. All investigated films degraded in soil up to 80 days. The good barrier properties to <b>water</b> <b>vapors</b> and the complete biodegradation in soil make the films based on sodium alginate and high methoxyl pectin potential ecological materials for packing and coating of foods and pharmaceutical products...|$|R

5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E
30|$|A {{tendency}} is opposite {{in the case}} of coated PSiNP (see squares in Figure 5). The PL intensity increases due to the passivation of non-radiative defects by water molecules in a gas phase. <b>Water</b> <b>vapors</b> are known to perform good passivation of the dangling bonds [29]. We suppose that coated PSiNPs are protected from the interaction with the liquid phase of water by hydrophobic PLGA layer. On one hand, the enhancement of PL takes place due to the interaction with <b>water</b> <b>vapors</b> present in pores of SiNPs (see Figure 6 c). On the other hand, the PVA coating provides the hydrophilic properties of PSiNPs. The PL properties of coated PSiNPs become stable after 1 [*]month of storage due to the saturation of described process.|$|R

5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum.

5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
