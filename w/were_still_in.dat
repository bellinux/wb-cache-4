Gradually, more prisoners were released, but 67,000 Belgian soldiers <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> captivity by 1945. Many prisoners of war were forced to work in quarries or in agriculture and around 2,000 died in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many {{different}} forms of fish and shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, remained in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt.|$|E

5|$|RAF night fighter defences <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> their infancy. Most fighters lacked {{radar and}} in any case, radar was {{short-range}} and unreliable. Instead, they flew outside the anti-aircraft guns' fields of fire on likely approach routes using the pilots' vision to locate enemy aircraft. In later years, the night fighter defences would be highly sophisticated. But in 1940, they were not effective. Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids.|$|E

5|$|The {{tax system}} was {{partially}} reformed in 1881, allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute-labor system. The first road district {{larger than the}} township level was created in Bay County in 1883 under Public Act278. This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction. Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to {{follow the lead of}} Bay County. By 1900, the plank roads were generally abandoned. While a few <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> good repair, most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches of gravel. Toll houses were empty shacks, and the ditches were clogged with duck ponds. Only 23 of the original 202plank roads chartered by the state <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> operation.|$|E

5|$|Whatever Tiberius's motives, the {{withdrawal}} was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. Gaius and Lucius <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor.

Later that day, as Daman reached its peak, all areas of Fiji were under a gale warning.

5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. The two shell hits suffered by Kaiser had been largely ineffectual, wounding only one crewmember.|$|E
5|$|After {{the revolt}} had largely been suppressed, those who {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty were initially allowed {{to retain their}} holdings and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, especially during the rule of Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Teodor Korona Muzaka in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of rule in the Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. These policies would lead {{in part to the}} formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444, and a new era in the Ottoman–Albanian wars.|$|E
5|$|All six ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Africa and the south Pacific, where they assissted in the suppression of uprisings such as the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands. Cormoran participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03.
