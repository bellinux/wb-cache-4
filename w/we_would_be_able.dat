500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{sued the}} FBI, whose National Gang Intelligence Center listed Juggalos as [...] "a loosely {{organized}} hybrid gang" [...] in a 2011 report. The report states that Juggalos are [...] "recognized as a gang in only four states... {{law enforcement officials}} in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo sub-sets". The report also noted that New Mexico was {{seeing a lot of}} Juggalo gang expansion due to their attraction to [...] "the tribal and cultural traditions of the Native Americans". The lawsuit asks for the documents that the FBI used to reach this conclusion; in August 2013, federal authorities had [...] "filed a motion to dismiss the case, saying they had already released several news media reports about Juggalos involved in criminal activity". The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan is working with ICP's lawyers in order [...] "to ensure the right of Juggalos everywhere to gather together and express their support of the I.C.P. without having to worry about being unfairly targeted and harassed by law enforcement". On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any [...] "criminal intelligence information" [...] about Juggalos destroyed. ICP announced in the edition of December 21, 2012 of the Hatchet Herald that they will be releasing a sideshow EP to The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013. After no word was heard on the album, it was speculated that it had been scrapped. In mid 2013 it was announced that ICP would be releasing their first ever box set titled The First Six. After the release date came and passed, The First Six was not released. In a February 2014 interview with Faygoluvers, the question was asked if <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get the box set. ICP thought it had already been released. Dog Beats (the first ever release on Psychopathic Records) was set to be the bonus album in the box set, ICP went back and decided to put House of Wax in the box set instead. The First Six was set to be released on October 28, 2014. After a minor setback, was ultimately released on November 25, 2014.|$|E

A “secret action plan” allowed American dollars to covertly support the long-ruling Okinawa Liberal Democratic Party and influence elections. Written in 1965 while Reischauer was serving as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, a classified Memorandum of Conversation put forth [...] "a post-reversion U.S. strategy for a permanent American military presence in Okinawa" [...] that included the option to introduce nuclear weapons." [...] The memorandum states that, “if Japan would accept nuclear weapons on Japanese soil, including Okinawa, and if it would provide us with assurances guaranteeing our military commanders effective control of the islands in time of military crisis, then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to keep our bases on the islands, even though ‘full sovereignty’ reverted to Japan.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After Operation Mongoose was ended, the Kennedy Administration {{made some}} {{attempts}} to mend {{relations with the}} Cuban government. As a number of documents released by the National Security Archive reveal, this happened fairly soon after the project ended. One document {{comes in the form}} of an options paper from a Latin American specialist about how to fix relations. The document begins by suggesting that, through the CIA's attempts to off Castro and topple the government, they had [...] "been looking seriously only at one side of the coin" [...] and that they could try the reverse side and try [...] "quietly enticing Castro over to us." [...] The document goes on to push for further studies into how exactly they would go about improving relations. The document also states the two possible outcomes that would come along with a better relationship with Cuba. The document states, [...] "In the short run, we would probably be able to neutralize at least two of our main worries about Castro: the reintroduction of offensive missiles and Cuban subversion. In the long run, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to work on eliminating Castro at our leisure and from a good vantage point.", the effort to mend the relationships would be framed heavily by the negative relations formed due to Operation Mongoose.|$|E

50|$|Whytt {{explains}} that the pupillary light reflex is the contractions and re-sizing of the pupil in different intensities of light. If the eye was incapable of contraction, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to see in one degree of light and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to differentiate the distance of light reflecting from near and far objects. Whytt discovers the pupillary light reflex based on an autopsy of a child suffering from hydrocephalus whose pupils were noted to be unresponsive to changes in light. In the autopsy, Whytt discovered a cyst compressing the optic thalamus in child's eye. Whytt concluded that the obstruction prevented the eye from contracting properly therefore limiting the child's eyesight. The pupillary light reflex is later named the Whytt Reflex.|$|R
2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another. He rejects {{the notion that}} any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of {{some sense of the}} power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere occasions of the will of some god(s), a view associated with the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche.
