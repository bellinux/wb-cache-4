It was shown that an increased shielding gas exit velocity increased the gas column’s stability and therefore its resistance to side draughts. Double helix geometry within the nozzle reduced the gas column’s stability by generating a fast moving wall of gas around a slow moving centre. A pierced internal plate initially increased the gas velocity, however, the nozzle was unable to maintain the velocity and the change produced gas columns of similar stability to a standard nozzle. A pierced end plate produced the best results, increasing the shielding gases exit velocity sufficiently to marginally outperform the standard 16 mm <b>welding</b> <b>nozzle...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a <b>welding</b> <b>nozzle</b> position manipulator. The manipulator consists of an angle support to which the remaining components of the device are attached either directly or indirectly. A pair of pivotal connections attach a weld nozzle holding link to the angle support and provide a two axis freedom of movement of the holding link {{with respect to the}} support angle. The manipulator is actuated by a pair of adjusting screws angularly mounted to the angle support. These screws contact a pair of tapered friction surfaces formed on the upper portion of the <b>welding</b> <b>nozzle</b> holding link. A spring positioned between the upper portions of the support angle and the holding link provides a constant bias engagement between the friction surfaces of the holding link and the adjustment screws, so as to firmly hold the link in position and to eliminate any free play in the adjustment mechanism. The angular relationships between the adjustment screws, the angle support and the tapered friction surfaces of the weld nozzle holding link provide a geometric arrangement which permits precision adjustment of the holding link with respect to the angle support and also provides a solid holding link mount which is resistant to movement from outside forces...|$|E

40|$|The {{inspection}} of non-planar surfaces encountered in NDT poses difficulties {{that can only}} be satisfactorily addressed by a transducer whose active surface is comprised of an efficient conformable piezoelectric material. This paper describes a novel composite 2 D array structure in which each element is a fine-scale array of piezoceramic fibres in a random arrangement. Device flexibility is imparted by the relatively soft flexible polymer phase which separates the elements. A comprehensive modelling programme, using the finite element package PZFlex, has produced the resulting structure which is termed a Composite Element Composite Array Transducer or CECAT. To facilitate the initial characterisation of the devices, the primary investigations have implemented the transducers as 1 D arrays by the application of appropriate electrode patterns.

40|$|Abstract. In welding processes, {{specially}} in {{those involved in}} critical applications, as the aerospace an automotive sectors, extensive non-destructive testing (NDT) is commonly used for quality assurance. Therefore, the possibility of avoiding those procedures by means of on-line, real-time monitoring techniques is of high interest. Several different approaches have been contemplated {{for the analysis of}} welding processes, from the measurement of the charge voltage induced by the plasma on the <b>welding</b> <b>nozzle,</b> to acoustic and imaging techniques. Spectroscopic analysis of the plasma emission spectrum is known to offer rich information about the process, allowing direct correlation between the weld quality and some plasma parameters. Despite its benefits, spectroscopic analysis exhibits the drawbacks of its high computational requirements and the difficulty of a non-invasive arrangement of the optical light-capturing system. In a previous paper a new spectroscopic technique allowing real-time full-spectroscopic analysis of arc welding processes, and, hence, detection of common defects in the weld seam, was presented. In this paper a welding monitoring sensor system in which the optical fiber capturing the light is embedded into the welding torch is presented.

40|$|Abstract: The {{inspection}} of cooling circuit components of French pressurized water reactors is mainly performed with contact ultrasonic transducers. The surfaces of components involve that {{the shapes of}} the solid wedges are not matched to the irregular surface or to the shape of components (butt <b>weld,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> elbow). This mismatch creates an irregular coupling layer between the wedge and the local surface, and can lead to beam distortions and losses of sensitivity. These two phenomena contribute to reduce the inspection performances. To improve such controls, a new concept of contact “smart phased array transducer ” has been developed {{with the support of the}} French safety authorities (IRSN). The phased array is flexible to fit the complex profile and to minimize the thickness of the coupling layer. The independent piezoelectric elements composing the radiating surface are mechanically assembled in order to build an articulated structure. A profilometer, embedded in the transducer, allows to compute in real-time the optimised delay laws to compensate the distortions of 2 D or 3 D profiles. Those delay laws are transferred to the real-time UT acquisition system, which applies them to the piezoelectric elements. This self-adaptive process preserves, during the scanning, the features of the focused beam (orientation and focal depth) in the specimen. Two prototypes are presented and inspections of realistic irregular profiles of 2 D and 3 D geometry mock-ups, including artificial flaws, have been carried out, to estimate the enhancement performances of the "smar...|$|R

5|$|The {{size of the}} <b>welding</b> torch <b>nozzle</b> {{depends on}} the amount of {{shielded}} area desired. The size of the gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|R
