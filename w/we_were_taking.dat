'You must know, I'm in love with her,' he added resolutely." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Clapton {{replaced}} Topham in October 1963 and {{by early}} 1964, the Yardbirds had expanded their following {{on the home}} counties club circuit. [...] The group made several attempts at recording in the studio, but were unable to reproduce their live sound to their satisfaction. Manager Giorgio Gomelsky then arranged to have a March performance at London's Marquee Club recorded. [...] A key element of the Yardbirds' live shows was an extended instrumental section during some songs. [...] Clapton recalled, [...] "While most other bands were playing three-minute songs, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> three-minute numbers and stretching them out to five or six minutes, during which time the audience would go crazy". [...] Dubbed a [...] "rave up", this musical arrangement usually came during the middle instrumental section, in which the band shifted the beat into double-time and built the instrumental improvisation to a climax. [...] The rave up has roots in jazz and became a signature part of the Yardbirds' sound. [...] Musicologist Michael Hicks describes it: ...|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 1970, Presley {{engineered}} {{a meeting}} with President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the hippies, the growing drug culture, and the counterculture in general. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people {{and that it was}} therefore important he [...] "retain his credibility". Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era, exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism and drug abuse in popular culture. On hearing reports of the meeting, Paul McCartney later said he [...] "felt a bit betrayed" [...] and commented: [...] "The great joke was that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> [...] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's death, hastened by prescription drug abuse.|$|E

500|$|Fear of Black Planet was {{conceived}} during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, a period roughly between 1987 and 1992 when artists took advantage of newly emerging sampling technology before record labels and lawyers took notice. Accordingly, Public Enemy were not compelled to obtain sample clearance for the album. This preceded the legal limits and clearance costs later placed on sampling, which effectively limited hip hop production and the complexity of its musical arrangements. In an interview with Stay Free!, Chuck D said of their use of sampling, [...] "Public Enemy's music was affected more than anybody's because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> thousands of sounds. If you separated the sounds, they wouldn't have been anything--they were unrecognizable. The sounds were all collaged together to make a sonic wall". An analysis by law professors Peter DiCola and Kembrew McLeod estimated that under the sample clearance system that had emerged in the music industry since the album's release, Public Enemy were to lose at least five dollars per copy if they were to clear the album's samples at 2010 rates; McLeod commented, [...] "a loss of five million dollars on a platinum record".|$|E
2500|$|The Yardbirds were {{a popular}} live {{attraction}} at music clubs. [...] Much of their reputation {{was built on}} their use of a [...] "rave up" [...] musical arrangement, an instrumental interlude that builds to a climax. Clapton credits the rave up to bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and explains: [...] "While most other bands were playing three-minute songs, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> three-minute numbers and stretching them out to five or six minutes, during which time the audience would go crazy". [...] In was at such performances that Clapton often broke a guitar string. [...] While he was putting on a new one, the audience would slowly clap their hands (slow handclapping). [...] This led manager Gomelsky to nickname him [...] "Eric 'Slowhand' Clapton".|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{recording}} of Go, the band {{set out on the}} [...] "4 Albums. 2 Nights. 7 Cities" [...] tour, which found the band performing their past discography over two nights. During that time period, they searched for the label to release Go, which was being mixed at the time. Several labels were interested from samples the band sent them. Another plan the band had was to pay entirely for mastering and manufacturing, and to then find a distributor. The band took meetings with various label heads, including with Brett Gurewitz, former Bad Religion guitarist and head of Epitaph Records, where the band was signed from 2003 to 2008. It was clear from the first meeting that the band would return to their [...] "first home," [...] with Pierre noting that, [...] "We had always enjoyed working with [...] and we loved the people there. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> meetings, but once we were hanging out with Brett, we got right back into the swing of things." ...|$|E

Then Bill Black picked up his bass and began acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam had {{the door to the}} control room open, and stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'We don't know'. He said, 'Well, back up. Try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again'. So we kinda talked it over and figured out a little bit what we were doin'. We ran it again, and of course Sam is listenin'. 'Bout the third or fourth time through, we just cut it. It was basically a rhythm record. It wasn't any great thing. It wasn't Sam tellin' him what to do. Elvis was joking around, just doing what come naturally, what he felt.|$|E

[...] Del Sandusky, the helmsman on Kerry's boat, PCF-94, stated, [...] "I saw the gun flashes in the jungle, and I saw the bullets skipping across the water."

[...] Michael Medeiros, aboard PCF-94, recalled [...] "a massive ambush. There were rockets and light machine gun fire plus small arms." [...] Jim Russell, the Psychological Operations Officer of the unit, who was on PCF-43, wrote [...] "All the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> small arms fire from the beach… Anyone who doesn't think that we were being fired upon must have been on a different river." ...|$|E
