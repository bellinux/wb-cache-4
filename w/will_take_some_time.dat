5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
25|$|A flooded suit {{may contain}} so much water that the diver cannot {{climb out of}} the water because of the weight and inertia. In this case it may be {{necessary}} to cut a small slit in the lower part of the leg to let water drain out as the diver rises out of the water. This <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> and agility will be seriously compromised. The damage should not be difficult to repair if the slit is cut with reasonable care.|$|E
25|$|In the film, where Harry and Hermione have {{travelled}} back in {{time and}} are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.|$|E

Twenty years later, {{his will}} was {{challenged}} in the House of Commons by his great niece Joane Hele (the granddaughter of Elize's brother Nicholas Hele, {{and the wife}} of Captain Edmond Lister) who petitioned the court to allow funds from the will to be redirected to her. Hele's executor, Sir John Maynard, was neutral to the outcome and Sir Edward Rhodes ruled that funds {{should be given to}} Joane but that the charitable causes should not be abandoned.|$|R
500|$|Upon Nixon's death, {{almost all}} of the news {{coverage}} mentioned Watergate, but for the most part, the coverage was favorable to the former president. The Dallas Morning News stated, [...] "History ultimately should show that despite his flaws, he was one of our most farsighted chief executives." [...] This offended some; columnist Russell Baker complained of [...] "a group conspiracy to grant him absolution". Cartoonist Jeff Koterba of the Omaha World-Herald depicted History before a blank canvas, his subject Nixon, as America looks on eagerly. The artist urges his audience to sit down; the work <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to complete, as [...] "this portrait is a little more complicated than most".|$|E

2500|$|Mayweather commented {{after the}} fight, [...] "Although it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> {{to make the}} match, I want to fight Kostya Tszyu". Tszyu, an Australian-based Russian, by then had {{established}} himself as the best light welterweight in the world. Mayweather {{did not get a}} chance to fight Tszyu, but went on to fight Ricky Hatton (who defeated Tszyu and won his Ring light welterweight championship). By the end of 2001, Mayweather was still ranked The Ring #1 super featherweight and #5 best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.|$|E

2500|$|An {{official}} in France's Atomic Energy Commission {{reported that they}} estimated the blast was [...] "about or less than a kiloton" [...] and expressed uncertainty {{about whether or not}} the blast was actually nuclear. [...] There have been various large planned and unplanned non-nuclear explosions comparable in yield to small nuclear detonations, such as the U.S. [...] "Minor Scale" [...] explosion from 1985, which used conventional explosives to simulate a 4 kiloton detonation. According to the Washington Times anonymous U.S. intelligence sources speculated there [...] "was a seismic event that registered about 4 on the Richter scale, but it still isn't clear if it was a nuclear test. You can get that kind of seismic reading from high explosives". The Wall Street Journal explains that this blast was equivalent to the explosive force of about US$100,000 worth of ammonium nitrate. [...] International experts have said that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to confirm whether it was a successful nuclear test, as North Korea claimed, or an unsuccessful one ("fizzle"), or perhaps not even a nuclear test at all.|$|E
