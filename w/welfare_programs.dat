5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in <b>welfare</b> <b>programs.</b> In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
40|$|This article {{integrates}} {{the theory}} of welfare stigma and {{the theory of}} optimal income taxation. We study optimal income taxation and an optimal <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> within a unified framework while taking welfare stigma into account. In our framework, the government is assumed to have two policy instruments, namely general income taxation and a <b>welfare</b> <b>program.</b> Individuals {{are assumed to be}} heterogeneous along two dimensions, namely wages (skill) and welfare stigma. The government cannot observe the two characteristics of individuals. Each individual is assumed to take the income tax schedule and the parameters of the <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> as given and make labor supply decisions to maximize his utility. The government is assumed to choose both an optimal income tax schedule and an optimal <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> so as to maximize a social welfare function subject to its own revenue budget constraint and individuals' behavioral response to the income tax schedule and the parameters of the <b>welfare</b> <b>program.</b> As the model cannot be solved analytically, we take a numerical simulation approach. Our simulations show that (I) it is optimal for the government to offer both a negative income tax schedule and a <b>welfare</b> <b>program,</b> which is consistent with the theoretical result obtained by An in a much-simplified version of our model, and (2) the actual <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> in the United States might be less generous than the optimal <b>welfare</b> <b>program.</b> stigma; optimal income taxation; optimal <b>welfare</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and <b>welfare</b> <b>programs,</b> but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E
5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs,</b> and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Zwingli had accused mendicant orders of {{hypocrisy}} and demanded their abolition {{in order to}} support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossmünster and Fraumünster and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraumünster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance Katharina von Zimmern) and established new <b>welfare</b> <b>programs</b> for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the Prophezei (Prophecy) or Carolinum, at the Grossmünster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The Zurich Bible translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by Christoph Froschauer, bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school. Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.|$|E

5|$|The Song dynasty was {{an era of}} {{administrative}} sophistication and complex social organization. Some of the largest cities in the world were found in China during this period (Kaifeng and Hangzhou had populations of over a million). People enjoyed various social clubs and entertainment in the cities, {{and there were many}} schools and temples to provide the people with education and religious services. The Song government supported social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs</b> including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and paupers' graveyards. The Song dynasty supported a widespread postal service that was modeled on the earlier Han dynasty (202 BCE – CE 220) postal system to provide swift communication throughout the empire. The central government employed thousands of postal workers of various ranks to provide service for post offices and larger postal stations. In rural areas, farming peasants either owned their own plots of land, paid rents as tenant farmers, or were serfs on large estates.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1973, it {{used oil}} {{money to fund}} social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs,</b> which led to house-building {{projects}} and improved healthcare and education. House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate homelessness and to replace the shanty towns created by Libya's growing urbanization. The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50% more hospitals than it had in 1968, {{while the number of}} doctors had grown from 700 to over 3000 in that decade. Malaria was eradicated, and trachoma and tuberculosis greatly curtailed. Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced. Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded. In doing so the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education system. Through these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands. These early social programs proved popular within Libya. This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi's personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter Omar Mukhtar.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's <b>welfare</b> <b>programs,</b> but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{welfare system}} in China has {{historically}} been segmented between rural and urban people. This institutional arrangement results in unequal <b>welfare</b> entitlements and <b>program</b> participation among rural migrants compared with their urban counterparts. Several pilot reforms to expand welfare coverage have been implemented in urban China. However, the participation rate among rural migrants is still low. The objective {{of this paper is}} to examine the contributory factors to the low <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> participation among migrants and provide recommendations for further welfare reform. Key literature/ theoretical perspective: This paper is mainly based on the theoretical framework of social exclusion, which considers social exclusion as a process of including some individuals and excluding others from benefits of membership. Originality: In addition to the discussion of institutional inequalities that have been identified in the existing literature, this paper makes contribution to the literature by introducing the important factors associated with market constraints and individual choices in understanding welfare participation in contemporary China. Methodology: The paper is mainly based on the analysis of qualitative data collected from a rural village (N= 20) and in-depth interviews (N= 53) with rural migrants in Guangzhou and Shanghai. Major Findings: The paper finds that low <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> participation is an outcome of interactions and negotiations among several parties. Institutional legacy and reform uncertainty directly or indirectly affect the motivation of <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> participation among rural migrants. The pattern of informal employment and enterprises’ noncompliance of labour law make the welfare reform more difficult. Unwillingness of contribution to the welfare pool discourages the expansion of <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> coverage. Furthermore, the individual settlement intention and rural land reform also influence migrants’ <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> participation at the destinations. Implication: The paper examines <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> participation issues among rural migrants in China. Limitation: Restricted by a small-scaled data, the paper could not provide information on to what extent that those factors influence the <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> participation. And further study on how to balance the interests among parties of state, enterprises and individuals is needed. 2 page(s...|$|R
