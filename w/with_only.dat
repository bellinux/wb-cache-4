5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated <b>with</b> <b>only</b> a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, <b>with</b> <b>only</b> a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

Methods: We compared the 25 -year mortality of 4809 men <b>with</b> diabetes <b>only</b> and 4625 men <b>with</b> MI <b>only</b> (all men aged 35 - 57 years).
