5|$|The {{back wall}} of the room, which is in shadow, is hung <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series of}} scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{body is a}} pale {{brown or}} silvery brown colour, {{transitioning}} to white below, with green, mauve and rosy reflections when the fish is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the competition indices of intercropping wheat and chickpea under nitrogen consumption, an experiment was arranged as factorial based on Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications during 2009 – 2010 in Gonbad Kavous University farm. Planting patterns factor included four levels of sole cropping Wheat (W), two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> Chickpea (W 2 C 1) one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> Chickpea (W 1 C 2) and sole cropping Chickpea (C) and nitrogen consumption contained four levels of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg N/h per/ha. Results showed that the highest grain yield and wheat equivalent yield was obtained from sole cropping of wheat. In the intercropping <b>of</b> two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> chickpea and one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> chickpea Land Equivalent Ratio was 0. 87 and 0. 71 respectively that was less than sole cropping of wheat and cicer. Relative Crowding Coefficient of wheat in two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> chickpea and one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> chickpea was 1. 93 and 1. 73 and of chickpea was 0. 15 and 0. 17 respectively. The Aggressivity parameter indicated a tendency for wheat to dominate cicer in both intercropping. Competitive Ratio in two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> chickpea was greater than one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>with</b> two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> chickpea. Actual Yield Loss and Intercropping Advantage in wheat was positive and in cicer was negative. Actual Yield Loss and Intercropping Advantage in Intercropping of wheat and cicer was decreased...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean helmet is the conical one {{reinforced}} <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> boar tusks. This type was widely used and became the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor, being in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean. Boar's tusk helmets consisted of a felt-lined leather cap, with several rows of cut boar's tusk sewn onto it.|$|E
5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E

5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} ripe for {{redevelopment}} by the landholding elite, {{who wished to}} have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The vestiges of the Privy Garden became {{the site of a}} new street. In 1808 a row of houses called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> trees led directly down to the river, until they were cut off by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in one of the houses between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The multisegmented legs end {{in two to}} five small {{segments}} called tarsi. Like {{many other}} insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, {{on the end of}} the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic beetles including the Dytiscidae (diving beetles), Haliplidae, and many species of Hydrophilidae, the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically <b>with</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> long hairs. Male diving beetles have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females. Other beetles have fossorial legs widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and clown beetles (Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as flea beetles (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.|$|E

25|$|Brunelleschi, {{and others}} like him, {{developed}} {{a passion for the}} highly refined style of Roman architecture, in which the forms and decorations followed rules of placement and proportion that had long been neglected. They sought to rediscover and apply these rules. It was a time of architectural theorising and experimentation. Brunelleschi built two large churches in Florence demonstrating how the new style could be applied, San Lorenzo's and Santo Spirito.
