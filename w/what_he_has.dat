5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
5|$|At the RV park, Mulder finds Ronnie. As {{he tries}} to arrest him, Mulder is {{surrounded}} and overwhelmed {{by a group of}} people with glowing green eyes. He wakes up the next morning in the RV park, in his car, where he is rejoined by Scully. They are both unharmed and the vampires have disappeared. Back in Washington, they give their unified report to Skinner, who is dumbfounded by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> heard.|$|E
5|$|At the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, {{a massive}} {{creature}} facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard {{is able to}} kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> seen and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.|$|E

5|$|Cooper's colleague, Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) {{wishes to}} conduct a further {{post-mortem}} on Laura's body, but it is due to be released for the funeral that day. As the argument grows more heated, Truman ends it by punching Rosenfield and knocking him down.

An unidentified plastic shard was also found in her stomach.|$|E
5|$|Ivan {{begins to}} recount {{the story of}} the Denial of Peter, in which Jesus foretells to Saint Peter that he will thrice deny Him before the next crowing of the cock. Peter follows Jesus upon His arrest and joins some workers in the yard {{standing}} around a fire as He is questioned. Thrice the workers suspiciously ask Peter if he knows Jesus and thrice he denies his acquaintance. A cock crows and Peter, realizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done, weeps.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E
60|$|An {{engagement}} {{was made}} for a walk to Smithell's the ensuing day; and meanwhile Middleton entered more fully into <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received from family traditions and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> thought out for himself on the matter in question.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> put it with scrupulous caution. But Lady Holchester {{understood}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{refrained from}} saving {{as well as}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> actually said. She had hitherto remained standing--she now sat down again. There was a visible impression produced on her at last.|$|R
60|$|She stood up, and {{he grinned}} {{to show that}} the whole thing was an immense lark, and that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done was just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> planned to do from the very beginning. So that {{incident}} ended. But he was very thoughtful all that day.|$|R
5|$|Edmund's cult re-emerged in the 10th {{century and}} the site of his burial grew wealthy {{as a result of}} {{receiving}} grants of land from royally connected benefactors. In about 986, the monks of Ramsey Abbey commissioned Abbo of Fleury to write an account of the saint's life and early cult. In his preface or dedicatory epistle Abbo addresses the work to St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury 960-988. Dunstan himself {{is the source of the}} story of the martyrdom, which he had heard told long before, in the presence of King Ã†thelstan, by an old man who swore an oath that he had been Edmund's own sword-bearer (armiger) on the fatal day. Abbo therefore clearly makes Dunstan, then still living and the recipient of his work, the authority for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to say.|$|E

Nafaryus promises to govern the empire as a fair leader in a new world where music is appreciated again ("Astonishing").|$|E
5|$|Strange {{meanwhile}} {{finds himself}} on the moon where he meets the Watcher Uatu, who tells him that the strange events are due to an anomaly he calls the Forerunner. The Forerunner is from the future and its presence {{in the past has}} disrupted reality to the point of impending annihilation of not only Strange's world but all other universes as well. Explaining his theory that the emergence of various superhumans on Stephen's Earth {{is the result of the}} universe trying to save itself, the Watcher tells Strange that he will not be able to repeat <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> learned while he is alive.|$|E

He agrees and becomes distraught when he realizes <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done. David consoles him and before he dies, forgives his comrade.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on Vevo on May 21, 2013. The video was directed by Rich Lee. The video features Levine and Emily Ratajkowski as his love interest, {{as well as the}} members of the band, covered in grey paint. Levine initially paints himself out of a purely white background and then paints Ratajowski in front of him. The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying paint when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine and his love interest passionately embracing - all while covered in grey paint. In the very last scene, Levine reverses <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done, removing all the paint from the scene, leaving no trace of them behind.|$|E
5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered over <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> learned, and Kain says his actions are justified {{due to his}} being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|Angie (Drea de Matteo) {{takes an}} instant dislike {{to her son}} Danny's (Beau Mirchoff) new girlfriend, Ana (Maiara Walsh), who she fears is too fun-loving and not serious enough.

Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven.

Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket.

As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|Lois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's {{upcoming}} {{first birthday}} party and sends Peter, along with Chris, {{to drop off}} the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek {{the opportunity to play}} with all the machines, causing Peter to lose his watch in a claw machine. A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. The Manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party.

He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois doesn't have do any work.|$|E
5|$|Lynch's {{original}} {{rough cut}} ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.|$|E
