5|$|Alongside the United States Department of Transportation, Allen and Vulcan Inc. {{launched}} the Smart City Challenge, a contest inviting American cities to transform their transportation systems. Created in 2015 with USDOT's $40million commitment {{as well as}} $10million from Allen's Vulcan Inc., the challenge aims to create a first-of-its-kind modern city that <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> how cities can improve quality of life while lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The winning city was Columbus, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will require sophisticated adaptive optics {{in order to}} be used to their full capability. Because the WHT has an advanced adaptive optics system already operating, it is receiving attention from the various ELT programs. The European Southern Observatory's European-ELT (E-ELT) project has begun a programme to utilise the WHT as a test-bed for its adaptive optics system, and will receive several nights per year for on-sky testing. The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci, and is called CANARY. CANARY <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E-ELT.|$|E

25|$|Organizational {{identification}} and workplace {{freedom of speech}} {{has an effect on}} an individual's choice of expressing dissent (Kassing, 2000). If an individual highly identifies himself or herself with the organization, {{they are more likely to}} use the dissent strategy that mirrors the organization's values. If the organization demonstrates it values dissent and promotes workplace freedom of speech, the highly identified employee <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> articulate dissent.|$|E
25|$|Vernacular {{architecture}} {{is influenced by}} a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building {{is subject to the}} same laws of physics, and hence <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> significant similarities in structural forms.|$|E
25|$|Blizzards {{get their}} {{name from the}} fact that they are so cold that they can be held {{upside-down}} and nothing will come out. Employees <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> this to customers. There is a company policy that one Blizzard per order is to be flipped upside-down by the employee. If they do not, then the customer may request a coupon for a free Blizzard to use on their next visit, though this is at the owner's discretion.|$|E

25|$|In women, serum {{estradiol}} {{is measured}} in a clinical laboratory and reflects primarily {{the activity of the}} ovaries. As such, they are useful in the detection of baseline estrogen in women with amenorrhea or menstrual dysfunction, and to detect the state of hypoestrogenicity and menopause. Furthermore, estrogen monitoring during fertility therapy assesses follicular growth and is useful in monitoring the treatment. Estrogen-producing tumors <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> persistent high levels of estradiol and other estrogens. In precocious puberty, estradiol levels are inappropriately increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{individuals}} with autism regarding learning {{is in the}} imitation of skills. This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills. Individuals with autism tend {{to be dependent on}} the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge. As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{diagnosis}} of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention. In post void residual, a catheter is inserted into the urinary tract immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50–100nbsp&ml suggests neurogenic bladder dysfunction. A kidney ultrasound <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> hydronephrosis if present. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis. However, in AKI, the use of IV contrast is contraindicated as the contrast agent used is nephrotoxic.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s, {{scientists}} believed folate deficiency and anemia {{were the}} same condition. In 1931, researcher Lucy Wills made a key observation {{that led to the}} identification of folate as the nutrient required to prevent anemia during pregnancy. <b>Wills</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that anemia could be reversed with brewer's yeast. In the late 1930s, folate was identified as the corrective substance in brewer's yeast.|$|R
25|$|George Hamilton died on 29 October 1797, and an {{analysis}} of his <b>will</b> <b>demonstrates</b> both that he and Mary were not married, and that James Walker was still alive in 1786. Hamilton made over all of his estate to Lady Mary, with the stipulation that the Jamaica estates were to be run for Mary's benefit by James Hope-Johnstone, 3rd Earl of Hopetoun and Alexander Leslie-Melville, 7th Earl of Leven (Mary's nephew).|$|R
25|$|The horse hoof {{is not at}} all a rigid structure. It is elastic and flexible. Just {{squeezing}} the heels by hand <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> that. When loaded, the hoof physiologically changes its shape. In part, this is a result of solar concavity, which has a variable depth, in the region of 1–1.5cm. In part, it {{is a result of the}} arched shape of the lateral lower profile of the walls and sole, so that when an unloaded hoof touches a firm ground surface, there is only contact at toe and heels (active contact). A loaded hoof has a much greater area of ground contact (passive contact), covering the lower wall edge, most of the sole, bars and frog. Active contact areas can be seen as slightly protruding spots in the walls and in the callused sole.|$|E
25|$|Görgei was so {{angered by}} the partial failure of that days {{military}} actions (although the Hungarian advancement, they could not breach the enemy lines, deciding {{the fate of the}} battle), that he dismissed Knezić from the lead of the III. corps because of his passivity, but also Asbóth from the lead of the II. corps, although he was the only corps commander, who accomplished his tasks. Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> to be an excellent choice, Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, but maybe the worst thing was that he did not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in the right moment to the battlefield. He chose to be on the battlefield to encourage his soldiers and officers, task which he accomplished with great success, turning many times the tides of the battle with his presence, personal example and words of encouragement.|$|E
25|$|Volvulus of {{the large}} colon usually occurs where the {{mesentery}} attaches to the body wall, but may also occur at the diaphragmatic or sternal flexures, with rotations up to 720 degrees reported. It is most commonly seen in postpartum mares, usually presents with severe signs of colic that are refractory to analgesic administration, and horses often lie in dorsal recumbency. Abdominal distention is common due to strangulation and rapid engorgement of the intestine with gas, which then can lead to dyspnea as the growing bowel pushes against the diaphragm and prevents normal ventilation. Additionally, compression can place pressure on the caudal vena cava, leading to pooling of blood and hypovolemia. However, horses {{may not have a}} high heart rate, presumably due to increased vagal tone. Rectal palpation <b>will</b> <b>demonstrate</b> a severely gas distended colon, and the examiner {{may not be able to}} push beyond the brim of the pelvis due to the obstruction. The colon may be irreversibly damaged in as little as 3–4 hours from the initial time of the volvulus, so immediate surgical correction is required. The surgeon works to correct the volvulus and then removes any damaged colon. 95% of the colon may be resected, but often the volvulus damages more than this amount, requiring euthanasia. Plasma lactate levels can help predict survival rates, with an increased survival seen in horses with a lactate below 6.0mmol/L. Prognosis is usually poor, with a survival rate of approximately 36% of horses with a 360 degree volvulus, and 74% of those with a 270 degree volvulus, and a reoccurrence rate of 5–50%. Complications post-surgery include hypoproteinemia, endotoxic shock, laminitis, and DIC.|$|E
