25|$|The {{method is}} a {{continuous}} process {{that begins with}} observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about <b>why</b> <b>things</b> are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.|$|E
500|$|The CCDI (and {{its local}} affiliates) enforces the inner-party {{supervision}} system. Although the system's history {{dates back to}} the 1970s and 1980s, it was not formalised until the 2004 [...] "Internal Supervision Regulation" [...] (ISR). The ISR reaffirmed the powers of the CCDI, institutionalised the central inspection teams and clearly separated the Party's decision-making institutions from its supervisory ones. With the ISR the CPC issued a list of member responsibilities subject to oversight by the CCDI and its local affiliates. Member supervision was not new; however, information on what was supervised (and explanations for <b>why</b> <b>things</b> were under supervision) was novel. Every party member is subject to supervision, but the ISR emphasises that leaders would be its focus. This was probably in reaction to the fact that no institutions except the central party leadership (including the local CDIs) had the de facto ability to supervise lower-level party institutions.|$|E

500|$|In Willow's {{dormitory}} room, Tara {{tries to}} help Willow find a shirt to wear. Xander and Anya arrive and double-park. Willow panics, rejecting shirt after shirt, {{not knowing how to}} appear for Buffy and Dawn. She asks why her clothes are stupid and she is childish, weeping until Tara kisses and calms her. Anya asks Xander what she is supposed to do; he cannot answer. Willow changes her shirt again and Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors. Anya asks if they will see the body, then if the body will be cut open, and Willow responds angrily. Anya tearfully says she does not understand how to behave, or why Joyce cannot go back into her own body, unable to understand human death, she states that it is all [...] "stupid and mortal", and no one will tell her <b>why</b> <b>things</b> are happening. Xander puts his fist through the wall, making him bleed but feel oddly better. As the group leaves to visit Buffy at the hospital, Xander gets a parking ticket.|$|E

2500|$|At between {{about the}} ages of four and seven, {{children}} tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence {{in the interest of}} reasoning and wanting to know <b>why</b> <b>things</b> are the way they are. Piaget called it the [...] "intuitive substage" [...] because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. Centration, conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.|$|E
