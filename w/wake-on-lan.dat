25|$|Liverpool was {{the first}} among UK {{universities}} to develop their desktop computer power management solution, which has been widely adopted by other institutions. The university has subsequently piloted other advanced software approaches further increasing savings. The university has also {{been at the forefront}} of using the Condor HTC computing platform in a power saving environment. This software, which makes use of unused computer time for computationally intensive tasks usually results in computers being left turned on. The university has demonstrated an effective solution for this problem using a mixture of <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> and commercial power management software.|$|E
2500|$|PME# (19A) - Power {{management}} event (optional) {{which is}} supported in PCI [...] and higher. It is a [...] open drain, active low signal. [...] PCI cards may use this signal to {{send and receive}} PME via the PCI socket directly, which {{eliminates the need for}} a special <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> cable.|$|E
50|$|As an example, {{assume the}} case of <b>Wake-on-LAN.</b> Traditionally, the OS {{controls}} <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> and must call third-party device drivers to enable support on a network card. With the HECI bus, the host is able to assert its request line (REQ#), the ME will assert its grant line (GNT#), and the host can send its message using its serial transmit signal. Upon receipt of the <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> enable message on HECI, the ME directly enables <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> in the integrated (or externally supported) network device. Without HECI drivers in the OS, <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> functionality is lost even if standard network drivers {{would be able to}} enable it. This is a major problem in large-scale enterprise deployments with standard software images.|$|E
50|$|For {{a machine}} which is {{normally}} unattended, precautions {{need to be}} taken to make the <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> function as reliable as possible. For a machine procured to work in this way, <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> functionality {{is an important part of}} the purchase procedure.|$|E

5000|$|Requires {{hardware}} {{support of}} <b>Wake-On-LAN</b> on destination computer ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> {{implementation}} {{is designed}} to be very simple and to be quickly processed by the circuitry present on the network interface card with minimal power requirement. Because <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> operates below the IP protocol layer, IP addresses and DNS names are meaningless and so the MAC address is required.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wake-on-LAN</b> {{support is}} {{implemented}} on the motherboard {{of a computer}} and the network interface (firmware), and is consequently not dependent on the operating system running on the hardware. Some operating systems can control <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> behaviour via NIC drivers. With older motherboards, if the network interface is a plug-in card rather than being integrated into the motherboard, the card {{may need to be}} connected to the motherboard by an additional cable. Motherboards with an embedded Ethernet controller which supports <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> do not need a cable. The power supply must meet ATX 2.01 specifications.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that because <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> is built upon broadcast technology {{it can only be}} used within the current network subnet. While this is generally the case, there are some exceptions, and <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> can operate across any network in practice, given appropriate configuration and hardware, including remote wake-up across the Internet.|$|E
50|$|The {{feature is}} {{controlled}} via the OS X System Preferences Energy Saver panel, in the Options tab. Marking the Wake for network access checkbox enables <b>Wake-on-LAN.</b> Apple's Apple Remote Desktop client management {{system can be}} used to send <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> packets, but there are also freeware and shareware Mac OS X applications available.|$|E
50|$|WfM {{included}} the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) and <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> (WOL) standards.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wake-on-LAN</b> support may {{be changed}} using a subfunction of the ethtool command.|$|E

50|$|In October 1996, Intel and IBM {{formed the}} Advanced Manageability Alliance (AMA). In April 1997, this {{alliance}} introduced the <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> technology.|$|E
5000|$|This {{style of}} remote {{operation}} has mostly been supplanted by <b>Wake-on-LAN,</b> which is newer but works {{in much the}} same way.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> to work, {{parts of the}} network {{interface}} need to stay on. This consumes {{a small amount of}} standby power, much less than normal operating power. The link speed is usually reduced to the lowest possible speed to not waste power (e.g. a Gigabit Ethernet NIC maintains only a 10 Mbit/s link). Disabling <b>wake-on-LAN</b> when not needed, can very slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket.|$|E
5000|$|ATX power {{signals are}} supported: AUX {{voltages}} for stand-by power and sleep states (Soft starts, <b>wake-on-LAN).</b> Supports PSON#, PWRGD, PWRRBT#, and ACPI states.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wake-on-LAN</b> (WoL) is an Ethernet or {{token ring}} {{computer}} networking standard {{that allows a}} computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message.|$|E
50|$|PCI version 2.2 {{supports}} PME (Power Management Events). PCI cards {{send and}} receive PME signals via the PCI socket directly, {{without the need for}} a <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> cable.|$|E
50|$|The Goverlan Reach Systems Management suite is {{used for}} IT management, {{software}} installation, inventory, and remote control. Other features include: displaying system information, mapping printers, and <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> settings.|$|E
5000|$|... "Advanced network client support"â€”includes {{support for}} {{multiple}} network interfaces. Also includes a <b>wake-on-LAN</b> feature {{may no longer}} work to wake sleeping computers for backup, reducing overall energy expenditure.|$|E
50|$|NightWatchman a PC power {{management}} tool which manages power use for servers and PCs. Included with NightWatchman is WakeUp, a <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> product used to power on PCs remotely for software updating and patching.|$|E
50|$|Abuse of the <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> feature only allows {{computers}} to be switched on; {{it does not}} in itself bypass password {{and other forms of}} security, and is unable to power off the machine once on.|$|E
50|$|Some PCs include {{technology}} {{built into}} the chipset to improve security for <b>Wake-on-LAN.</b> For example, Intel AMT (a component of Intel vPro technology), includes Transport Layer Security (TLS), an industry-standard protocol that strengthens encryption.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> the {{situation}} was relatively simple: a machine was connected to power but switched off, and it was arranged that a special packet be sent to switch the machine on.|$|E
50|$|On December 2, 2009, Compulab {{announced}} the fit-PC2i, a fit-PC2 variation targeting networking and industrial applications.fit-PC2i adds a second Gbit Ethernet port, <b>Wake-on-LAN,</b> S/PDIF output and RS232 port, has two fewer USB ports, and no IR.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, 01 Communique {{released}} an upgraded {{version of the}} software called I'm InTouch Premium. New to the program was a feature allowing users to remotely power on their shut down computers for access using <b>Wake-On-LAN</b> technology.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{in order}} to get <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> to work {{enabling}} this feature on the network interface card or on-board silicon is sometimes required. Details of how to do this depend upon the operating system and the device driver.|$|E
50|$|Hardware-based {{management}} {{has been available}} in the past, {{but it has been}} limited to auto-configuration (of computers that request it) using DHCP or BOOTP for dynamic IP address allocation and diskless workstations, as well as <b>wake-on-LAN</b> for remotely powering on systems.|$|E
5000|$|In Windows Vista and higher, one {{can also}} {{determine}} how the OS was powered up. Running the powercfg.exe /lastwake command in a CMD prompt will list the [...] "Wake Source". The <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> event should also be logged in the System event log.|$|E
50|$|FastAdmin {{is a small}} utility {{that gives}} administrators a quick {{overview}} of all Active Directory computer systems and performs tasks like starting a remote command or PowerShell prompt, restart, shutdown, <b>wake-on-lan,</b> initiate a remote desktop session, offer remote help, run files remotely, and more.|$|E
50|$|IT shops using <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> {{through the}} Intel AMT {{implementation}} can wake an AMT PC over network environments that require TLS-based security, such as IEEE 802.1x, Cisco Self Defending Network (SDN), and Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP) environments. The Intel implementation also works for wireless networks.|$|E
50|$|Most {{commonly}} expected {{features for}} a product in this arena are present. Examples include reboot and reconnect, drag and drop file transfer, screen recording, safe mode support, multiple monitor, command line access, <b>wake-on-LAN,</b> VoIP, chat, and a custom toolbox for quick deployment of support tools.|$|E
50|$|Some {{machines}} do {{not support}} <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> {{after they have been}} disconnected from power (e.g., when power is restored after a power failure). Use of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) will give protection against a short period without power, although the battery will discharge during a prolonged power cut.|$|E
50|$|Older {{motherboards}} {{must have}} a WAKEUP-LINK header onboard connected to the network card via a special 3-pin cable; however, systems supporting the PCI 2.2 standard and with a PCI 2.2 compliant network adapter card do not usually require a <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> cable as the required standby power is relayed through the PCI bus.|$|E
50|$|Recent power {{supplies}} have a standby voltage available, to allow {{most of the}} computer system to be powered off. When the computer is powered down but the power supply is still on, it can be started remotely via <b>Wake-on-LAN</b> and Wake-on-ring or locally via Keyboard Power ON (KBPO) if the motherboard supports it.|$|E
