5000|$|The water puddle method (ASTM D7002), the <b>water</b> <b>lance</b> method (ASTM D7703) [...] and {{the newly}} {{introduced}} arc testing method (ASTM D7953) are used for bare geomembranes. For the water puddle and <b>water</b> <b>lance</b> methods, water is sprayed onto the geomembrane, creating an electrically conductive layer above the geomembrane. A low voltage DC power source {{is applied to the}} water above the geomembrane and grounded to the earth below the geomembrane. The leak detection equipment features an ammeter in series with the applied potential circuit. The ammeter registers an increase in current {{in the presence of a}} leak, resulting in an audible tone and visual increase in the current level. The expected minimum sensitivity of the water-based bare geomembrane liner integrity methods is a one millimeter diameter circular leak. For the arc testing method, water is not required. A low voltage is introduced above the geomembrane and grounded to the conductive layer below it. In the presence of a hole, an electrical arc is formed along with an audible alarm. Since the arc testing method is not dependent on water making good contact through the leak, it is more sensitive than the water-based methods. The minimum sensitivity of the arc testing bare geomembrane liner integrity method is a pinhole leak.|$|E

Table 1 - 1 lists 18 SSTs covered by this NOC. This NOC also addresses other activities that are performed in support of salt well pumping but do not require the application of a portable exhauster. Specifically this NOC analyzes the following three activities that have the potential for emissions. (1) Salt well pumping (i. e., the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) under nominal tank operating conditions. Nominal tank operating conditions include existing passive breathing rates. (2) Salt well pumping (the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) with use of a portable exhauster. (3) Use of a <b>water</b> <b>lance</b> on the waste to facilitate salt well screen and salt well jet pump installation into the waste. This activity is to be performed under nominal (existing passive breathing rates) tank operating conditions. The use of portable exhausters represents a cost savings because one portable exhauster can be moved back and forth between SSTs as schedules for salt well pumping dictate. A portable exhauster also could be used to simultaneously exhaust more than one SST during salt well pumping...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the prospects of using bulk waste characteristics to determine the most appropriate heel retrieval technology. If the properties of hard to remove heels can be determined before bulk retrieval, then a heel retrieval technology can be selected before bulk retrieval is complete. This would save substantially on sampling costs and would allow the deployment of the heel retrieval technology immediately after bulk retrieval. The latter would also accelerate the heel removal schedule. A number of C-farm retrievals have been fully or partially completed at the time of this writing. Thus, there is already substantial information on the success of different technologies and the composition of the heels. There is also substantial information on the waste types in each tank based on historical records. Therefore, this study will correlate the performance of technologies used so far and compare them to the known waste types in the tanks. This will be used to estimate the performance of future C Farm heel retrievals. An initial decision tree is developed and employed on tanks C- 101, C- 102, and C 111. An assumption of this study is that no additional characterization information would be available, before or after retrieval. Note that collecting additional information would substantially increase the probability of success. Deploying some in-situ testing technologies, such as a <b>water</b> <b>lance</b> or an in-situ Raman probe, might substantially increase the probability of successfully selecting the process conditions without having to take samples from the tanks for laboratory analysis...|$|E
40|$|The River Protection Project (RPP), {{which is}} {{managed by the}} Department of Energy (DOE) Office of River Protection (ORP), is highly complex from technical, regulatory, legal, political, and {{logistical}} perspectives and is the largest ongoing environmental cleanup project in the world. Over the past three years, ORP has made significant advances in its planning and execution of the cleanup of the Hartford tank wastes. The 149 single-shell tanks (SSTs), 28 double-shell tanks (DSTs), and 60 miscellaneous underground storage tanks (MUSTs) at Hanford contain approximately 200, 000 m{sup 3 } (53 million gallons) of mixed radioactive wastes, some of which {{dates back to the}} first days of the Manhattan Project. The plan for treating and disposing of the waste stored in large underground tanks is to: (1) retrieve the waste, (2) treat the waste to separate it into high-level (sludge) and low-activity (supernatant) fractions, (3) remove key radionuclides (e. g., Cs- 137, Sr- 90, actinides) from the low-activity fraction to the maximum extent technically and economically practical, (4) immobilize both the high-level and low-activity waste fractions by vitrification, (5) interim store the high-level waste fraction for ultimate disposal off-site at the federal HLW repository, (6) dispose the low-activity fraction on-site in the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF), and (7) close the waste management areas consisting of tanks, ancillary equipment, soils, and facilities. Design and construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP), the cornerstone of the RPP, has progressed substantially despite challenges arising from new seismic information for the WTP site. We have looked closely at the waste and aligned our treatment and disposal approaches with the waste characteristics. For example, approximately 11, 000 m{sup 3 } (2 - 3 million gallons) of metal sludges in twenty tanks were not created during spent nuclear fuel reprocessing and have low fission product concentrations. We plan to treat these wastes as transuranic waste (TRU) for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), which will reduce the WTP system processing time by three years. We are also developing and testing bulk vitrification as a technology to supplement the WTP LAW vitrification facility for immobilizing the massive volume of LAW. We will conduct a full-scale demonstration of the Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System by immobilizing up to 1, 100 m{sup 3 } (300, 000 gallons) of tank S- 109 low-curie soluble waste from which Cs- 137 had previously been removed. This past year has been marked by both progress and new challenges. The focus of our tank farm work has been retrieving waste from the old single-shell tanks (SSTs). We have completed waste retrieval from three SSTs and are conducting retrieval operations on an additional three SSTs. While most waste retrievals have gone about as expected, we have faced challenges with some recalcitrant tank heel wastes that required enhanced approaches. Those enhanced approaches ranged from oxalic acid additions to deploying a remote high-pressure <b>water</b> <b>lance.</b> As with all large, long-term projects that employ first of a kind technologies, we continue to be challenged to control costs and maintain schedule.

These problems are fuel, system design, and operating condition dependent. Conventional slag and ash removal methods include the use of in situ blowing or jet-type devices such as air or steam soot blowers and <b>water</b> <b>lances.</b> Pulse detonation technology for the purpose of removing slag and fouling deposits in coal-fired utility power plant boilers offers great potential. The detonation wave technique based on high impact velocity with sufficient energy and thermal shock on the slag deposited on gas contact surfaces offers a convenient, inexpensive, yet efficient and effective way to supplement existing slag removal methods. These detonation waves have been demonstrated experimentally to have exceptionally high shearing capability important to the task of removing slag and fouling deposits. Several tests have been performed with single shot detonation wave at University of Texas at Arlington to remove the slag deposit. To hold the slag deposit samples at the exit of detonation tube, two types of fixture was designed and fabricated. They are axial arrangement and triangular arrangement. The slag deposits from the utility boilers have been used to prepare the slag samples for the test. The experimental results show that the single shot detonation wave is capable of removing the entire slag (types of slag deposited on economizer, and air-heater, i. e., relatively softer slags) and 30 % of the reheater slag (which is harder) even at a distance of 6 in. from the exit of a detonation engine tube. Wave strength and slag orientation also have different effects on the chipping off of the slag. The annual report discusses about the results obtained in effectively removing the slag...|$|R

40|$|Pulse {{detonation}} {{technology for}} the purpose of removing slag and fouling deposits in coal-fired utility power plant boilers offers great potential. Conventional slag removal methods including soot blowers and <b>water</b> <b>lances</b> have great difficulties in removing slags especially from the down stream areas of utility power plant boilers. The detonation wave technique, based on high impact velocity with sufficient energy and thermal shock on the slag deposited on gas contact surfaces offers a convenient, inexpensive, yet efficient and effective way to supplement existing slag removal methods. A slight increase in the boiler efficiency, due to more effective ash/deposit removal and corresponding reduction in plant maintenance downtime and increased heat transfer efficiency, will save millions of dollars in operational costs. Reductions in toxic emissions will also be accomplished due to reduction in coal usage. Detonation waves have been demonstrated experimentally to have exceptionally high shearing capability, important to the task of removing slag and fouling deposits. The experimental results describe the parametric study of the input parameters in removing the different types of slag and operating condition. The experimental results show that both the single and multi shot detonation waves have high potential in effectively removing slag deposit from boiler heat transfer surfaces. The results obtained are encouraging and satisfactory. A good indication has also been obtained from the agreement with the preliminary computational fluid dynamics analysis that the wave impacts are more effective in removing slag deposits from tube bundles rather than single tube. This report presents results obtained in effectively removing three different types of slag (economizer, reheater, and air-heater) t a distance of up to 20 cm from the exit of the detonation tube. The experimental results show that the softer slags can be removed more easily. Also closer the slag to the exit of the detonation tube, the better are their removals. Side facing slags are found to shear off without breaking. Wave strength and slag orientation also has different effects on the chipping off of the slag. One of the most important results from this study is the observation that the pressure of the waves plays a vital role in removing slag. The wave frequency is also important after a threshold pressure level is attained...|$|R

Generally coastal areas receive more pollutant loads from different sources including geogenic and anthropogenic sources. Central Godavari delta is located adjacent to the Bay of Bengal Coast, Andhra Pradesh, India and is drained by Pikaleru, Kunavaram and Vasalatippa drains. The area is occupied by recent Quaternary alluvium and gone through a series of marine transgression and regression. The entire study area comes under Godavari central canal command area, water is available throughout year except first week of June and last week of April in the canals. Water requirements for irrigation met from surface water in the delta. There is no groundwater pumping for agriculture as wells as for domestic purpose due to brackish nature of the groundwater at shallow depths. The groundwater depths varying from 0. 8 to 3. 4 m dug wells and in bore wells located near the coast 4. 5 – 13. 3 m. The established groundwater flow direction is to be towards Bay of Bengal from Amalapuram. Geophysical and hydrochemical tools were applied to identify the source of the salinity and to assess the saline water intrusion in the Godavari delta. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) surveys were carried out at several locations in the deltaic region to delineate the aquifer geometry and to identify saline water aquifer zones. The results inferred from ERT indicate 12 – 15 m thick loamy sands were existed from surface to subsurface and it is followed by 18 – 25 m thick clay layers. The thickness of clay is being increased toward Sea from inland. The low resistivity values in the delta are attributed to existence of the thick marine clays in the subsurface and relative high resistivities are attributed to existence of fresh water.

The injection strategy for the subsurface conditions at the site was determined using numerical simulations. An appropriate variant of Colloidal Silica (CS) was selected as the barrier liquid based on its relative insensitivity to interactions with the site soils, and the formulation for optimum site performance was determined.

Splashed liquid in the forward direction was collected and measured in each case. The forward splashing rate was found to increase with the increase of lance angle from the vertical and flow rate. But the splashing rate is not a monotonous function of lance height. Splashing rate increases with lance height up to a critical distance and after that splashing rate decreases with the increase of lance height.

40|$|The area {{described}} in this report includes the eastern, or lower, end of the valley of Pumpkin Creek and is in Morrill and Banner Counties, in western Nebraska. A reconnaissance of the geology and ground-water resources of the area was made to determine the possibilities of developing ground-water supplies for irrigation. Rocks that crop out in the Pumpkin Creek area are shown on a geologic map that {{is included in the}} report. They range in age from Oligocene to Recent and consist of the Brule, Arikaree, and Ogallala formations and of the alluvium. The Chadron formation, of Oligocene age, underlies the area but is not exposed at the surface. The Lance formation, of Late Cretaceous age, underlies the Chadron formation. Sandstones, which are thought to be in the Lance formation, contain ground water under artesian pressure and might yield sufficient water for irrigation on a small scale. Several thousand feet of Pierre shale, which is not known to yield appreciable quantities of water to wells, underlies the Lance formation. In some places sufficient water for irrigation can be obtained by wells from fractures in the Brule formation. Large supplies of water can be expected in places where the fractures are extensive or where they are overlain by saturated alluvial material. A few springs that are fed by recharge from the upland area issue at the contact of the Brule and Arikaree formations. The Ogallala formation yields water to domestic and stock wells in the upland areas south of Pumpkin Creek valley. Inasmuch as this formation is high topographically and is well drained, the depth to water is considerable generally 100 ft or more and the thickness of the saturated material probably is not great. It is doubtful, therefore, that sufficient water for irrigation could be obtained from this material; however, it may be possible in some places to obtain water for irrigation on a small scale. Alluvium, which underlies the floodplains of Pumpkin Creek and some of its major tributaries, is the principal aquifer in the area. The alluvium of Quaternary age consists of coarse sand and gravel and yields sufficient water for irrigation. In most places yields of 1, 000 to 2, 000 gpm probably could be obtained from properly constructed wells in this material. It is estimated that about 21, 000 acre-ft of ground water annually leaves the area as stream flow. This represents approximately the amount of additional ground water available for development; however, if sufficient ground water is pumped to lower the water table appreciably, the additional water salvaged from loss by evaporation and transpiration also would be available for irrigation use. The development of any additional ground water from the unconfined ground-water reservoir will cause a reduction in the flow of Pumpkin Creek. Water from the alluvium and the Brule formation is moderately mineralized. Although most water is hard, some soft water is obtained from the Brule. The dissolved solids in water from the Brule formation and the alluvium ranged from 236 to 356 ppm. Hardness in these two water-bearing formations ranged from 6. 0 to 20 k ppm. Water obtained from deep wells in the Lance formation is more mineralized and softer than water obtained from the overlying formations. The dissolved solids, which consist largely of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, range from 812 to 1, 170 ppm. Although the <b>water</b> from the <b>Lance</b> formation is satisfactory for domestic needs, the high percentage of sodium restricts its use for irrigation...|$|R
