5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
5|$|Starting at 11am on March 14, Thieu {{flew out}} to Cam Ranh for a {{briefing}} with General Phu. The events {{which took place}} after this briefing would go down {{as one of the}} greatest failures in military history. After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> them to use that road due to its poor condition.|$|E

25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{distinct}} from this—it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> based on Lenz's law.|$|E
25|$|Two-slit {{diffraction}} is {{a famous}} {{example of the}} strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits {{cancel each other out}} in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.|$|E
25|$|Rush hour {{occurs on}} weekdays between 5 am and 10 am, {{and in the}} {{afternoon}} between 3 pm and 7 pm (although rush-hour traffic can occasionally spill out to 11 am and start again from 2:00 pm until as late as 10 pm, especially on Fridays). Traffic can occur at almost any time, particularly before major holidays (including Thanksgiving, Christmas, and three-day weekends) and even on regular weekends when one otherwise <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> it.

With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E
25|$|To see why exotic {{matter is}} required, {{consider}} an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands {{on the other}} side. The expansion goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> caustics to develop, at least within {{the vicinity of the}} neck. According to the optical Raychaudhuri's theorem, this requires a violation of the averaged null energy condition. Quantum effects such as the Casimir effect cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature, but calculations in semiclassical gravity suggest that quantum effects may be able to violate this condition in curved spacetime. Although it was hoped recently that quantum effects could not violate an achronal version of the averaged null energy condition, violations have nevertheless been found, so it remains an open possibility that quantum effects might be used to support a wormhole.|$|E
25|$|More {{controversial}} was {{the proposal}} for an “understanding” clause requiring each applicant to demonstrate {{an understanding of}} the Constitution to a county registrar. Alfred P. Thom, a railroad lawyer from Norfolk, explained “I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> an impartial administration of the clause.” There would be no “friendship by the white man to the suffrage of the black man”, but on the other hand, Thom did not expect a rigid examination for a white man, “this clause will not exclude any worthy white citizen of this Commonwealth from the suffrage…he will find a friendly examiner.” Robert William Blair of Southwest Wythe County objected to the provisions proposed by Carter Glass which were the same methods used to bring disenfranchisement other Southern states. The understanding clause would give too much power to the “caprice and corruption of a dishonest election officer.” In western Virginia, hundreds would be unable to meet the new requirements, without enough property, unable to pay the poll tax for three consecutive years, or who would fail the registrar’s examination on Constitutional understanding.|$|E

25|$|Henry FitzEmpress {{returned}} to England {{again at the}} start of 1153 with a small army, supported in the north and east of England by Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod. Stephen's castle at Malmesbury was besieged by Henry's forces and the king responded by marching west with an army to relieve it. Stephen unsuccessfully attempted to force Henry's smaller army to fight a decisive battle along the River Avon. In the face of the increasingly wintry weather, Stephen agreed to a temporary truce and {{returned to}} London, leaving Henry to travel north through the Midlands where the powerful Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, announced his support for the Angevin cause. Despite only modest military successes, Henry and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter. Many of the details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the bishops to attend his court.|$|E

Fahey stood head and shoulders above the many highly decorated full internationals in the Hertha team, showing the full range of his passing from deep and from close range, and generally showing a poise and guile on the ball that you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> from a League of Ireland player amongst such illustrious company." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Victoria's first acts as queen was {{to dismiss}} Conroy {{from her own}} household, though she could not dismiss him from her mother's. Queen Victoria, as an {{unmarried}} young woman, was still expected {{to live with her}} mother, but she relegated the Duchess and Conroy to remote apartments at Buckingham Palace, cutting off personal contact with them. The Duchess unsuccessfully insisted that Conroy and his family be allowed at court; Victoria disagreed, saying: [...] "I thought you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> me to invite Sir John Conroy after his conduct towards me for some years past." [...] In 1839, the Duke of Wellington convinced Conroy to leave the Duchess's household and take his family to the Continent in effective exile. The Times reported that he no longer had official duties, though they were unsure if he had resigned or been dismissed. That year rumours abounded that Lady Flora Hastings, whose abdomen had grown large, was pregnant by Conroy. A subsequent medical investigation concluded that Lady Flora was a virgin and she died from liver cancer several months later. This scandal, in tandem with the Bedchamber Crisis, damaged Victoria's reputation.|$|E

Glass enjoyed this aspect of the role as well: [...] "Though rather mysterious, it was absolutely clear that he had had a very full life before he went off to the monastery and took on that responsibility. I loved the fact that he could save your soul but he could also kick your ass. That's a really great combination to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sruthán (stream) was mistakenly {{cited by}} Thomas O'Connor in the Ordnance Survey Letters in 1837, and adopted as the Irish form of Straffan.

An Sruthán gained currency among {{those involved in the}} Irish revival and was promoted as name in the local schools. Recent research by Domhnall mac Giolla Easpaig declares it [...] "completely at odds with the written evidence cited above and with local pronunciation and appears to be no more than an ad hoc explanation of the name by O'Connor's informant."

For example, An Nam chí lược is the earliest surviving historical book to mention Lady Triệu who led a rebellion against the kingdom of Eastern Wu in 3rd century. Besides the historical accounts, An Nam chí lược also contains valuable information about the geography, tradition and culture of Vietnam such as the influence of Taoism in Đại Việt. The oldest records about the activities of Đại Việt people from the ancient time to the Trần Dynasty {{are found in the}} first chapter of the An Nam chí lược, by his own experiences, Lê Tắc made a detailed description about the Vietnamese tradition of singing, dancing and musical instruments.
