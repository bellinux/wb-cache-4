5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of <b>wedging</b> a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{avoidance}} {{may also}} explain the frequent behaviour where S.latus will carry food items {{back to a}} shelter before consuming them. When two S.latus individuals compete for a food item, they may use the enlarged second antennae to flip their opponent over, by <b>wedging</b> the antennae underneath the opponent's body and quickly raising them. An alternative strategy is to grip an opponent and begin the tail-flipping movement, or {{to engage in a}} tug of war.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{approximately}} the current {{depth of the}} Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward erosion {{of one of those}} tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost <b>wedging</b> create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today.|$|E
5000|$|Gap <b>wedges</b> are loosely defined, but {{typically}} have the loft between {{that of a}} pitching <b>wedge</b> and sand <b>wedge,</b> between 50 and 54 degrees. At the extremes there is redundancy with either the pitching <b>wedge</b> (typically 48°) or the sand <b>wedge</b> (typically 56°), however some players will [...] "fine-tune" [...] the lofts of these other <b>wedges</b> to their play style, leading to alternate loft choices for a gap <b>wedge.</b> Most players look for a separation of 4 degrees between clubs, and so with the standard pitching and sand <b>wedge</b> lofts, the complementary gap <b>wedge</b> would be 52°.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of golf, a gap <b>wedge,</b> also known as an all <b>wedge,</b> is a <b>wedge</b> used to hit a shot with higher and shorter {{trajectory}} than a pitching <b>wedge</b> and lower and longer trajectory than a sand <b>wedge.</b> The name derives from the club's design to fill the [...] "gap" [...] between sand and pitching <b>wedges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The gap <b>wedge</b> {{was created}} {{to fill the gap}} that {{appeared}} between the pitching <b>wedge</b> and the sand <b>wedge,</b> as the numbered irons including the pitching <b>wedge</b> were de-lofted to compensate for cavity-backed irons' higher launch angle. The gap <b>wedge</b> has a loft similar to that of an older pitching <b>wedge,</b> around 52°, and can also be found labelled as an [...] "approach", [...] "dual", [...] "utility", or [...] "attack" [...] <b>wedge.</b> Originally designed with relatively low bounce for use from the fairway or other thinner lies, gap <b>wedges,</b> like many <b>wedges,</b> are now offered with different amounts of bounce to accommodate differing player techniques and preferences.|$|R
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, <b>wedging</b> the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, <b>wedging</b> and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the visual interest of his show, Emerson would abuse his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating {{it with a}} whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and <b>wedging</b> knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Wedge</b> {{filters are}} {{commonly}} used in radiation oncology for eliminating hot spots and creating a uniform dose distribution in optimizing isodose curves in the target volume for clinical aspects. These are some limited standard physical <b>wedges</b> (15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °),or creating an arbitrary <b>wedge</b> angle, like motorized <b>wedge</b> or dynamic <b>wedge,</b> [...] . The new formulation is presented by the combination of <b>wedge</b> fields for determining an arbitrary effective <b>wedge</b> angles. The isodose curves also are derived for these <b>wedges.</b> Materials and Methods: we performed the dosimetry of Varian Clinac 2100 C/D with Scanditronix Wellhofer water blue phantom, CU 500 E, OmniPro-Accept software and 0. 13 cc ionization chamber for 6 Mv photon beam in depth of 10 cm (reference depth) for universal physical <b>wedges</b> (15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 °) and reference field 10. 10 cm 2. By combining the isodose curve standard <b>wedge</b> fields with compatible weighting dose for each field, the effective isodose curve is calculated for any <b>wedge</b> angle. Results: The relation between a given effective <b>wedge</b> angle and the weighting of each combining <b>wedge</b> fields was derived. A good agreement {{was found between the}} measured and calculated <b>wedge</b> angles and the maximum deviation did not exceed 3 °. The difference between the measured and calculated data decreased when the combined <b>wedge</b> angles were closer. The results are in agreement with the motorized single <b>wedge</b> appliance in the literature. Conclusions: This technique showed that the effective <b>wedge</b> angle that is obtained from this method is adequate for clinical applications and the motorized <b>wedge</b> formalism is a special case of this consideration...|$|R
25|$|Brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) {{have been}} {{observed}} to methodically use bark pieces to remove other flakes of bark from a tree. The birds insert the bark piece underneath an attached bark scale, using it like a wedge and lever, to expose hiding insects. Occasionally, they reuse the same piece of bark several times and sometimes even fly short distances carrying the bark flake in their beak. The evolutionary origin of this tool use {{might be related to}} these birds frequently <b>wedging</b> seeds into cracks in the bark to hammer them open with their beak, which can lead to bark coming off.|$|E
25|$|Super Go Karts: The karts {{were meant}} to be driven around a small loop track at a speed of about 20mph (32km/h) set by the {{governor}} devices on them. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by <b>wedging</b> tennis balls into them, and they were known to do so for parkgoers. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine car ride became a chance to play bumper cars at 50mph (80km/h), and many injuries resulted from head-on collisions. Also, the engines were poorly maintained, and some riders were overcome by gasoline fumes as they drove.|$|E
25|$|All Pinedale glaciers {{probably}} {{melted away}} {{soon after the}} start of the Holocene epoch. The dozen small cirque glaciers seen today were formed during a subsequent neoglaciation 5000 years ago. Mount Moran has five such glaciers with Triple Glaciers on the north face, Skillet Glacier on the east face, and Falling Ice Glacier on the southeast face. All the glacial action has made the peaks of the Teton Range jagged from frost <b>wedging.</b> Other glaciers include Teton Glacier, below the east face of Grand Teton, Middle Teton Glacier, situated on the northeast slopes of Middle Teton, and the fast retreating Schoolroom Glacier, west of Grand Teton at Hurricane Pass.|$|E

25|$|Wetter and cooler {{conditions}} {{developed during}} the Pleistocene epoch and briefly returned via at least two neoglacial episodes (little ice ages) in the current epoch, the Holocene. The various rivers and streams in the area were engorged by increased precipitation and with melt-water from mountain glaciers on the Henry Mountains {{to the east and}} the Aquarius Plateau {{to the west of the}} park. Flash floods, mass wasting of hillsides, frost <b>wedging,</b> and landslides all contributed to a significantly faster rate of erosion. Glaciers plucked 20- to 30-million-year-old black basaltic boulders from atop Boulder and Thousand Lake Mountains that were subsequently deposited over the park area by meltwater streams from the glaciers, rockslides and floods.|$|E

500|$|The {{dry line}} is the {{boundary}} between dry and moist air masses east of mountain ranges with similar orientation to the Rockies, depicted {{at the leading edge}} of the dew point, or moisture, gradient. Near the surface, warm moist air that is denser than warmer, dryer air wedges under the drier air in a manner similar to that of a cold front <b>wedging</b> under warmer air. When the warm moist air wedged under the drier mass heats up, it becomes less dense and rises and sometimes forms thunderstorms. [...] At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the cooler, drier air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.|$|E

500|$|Continuing his {{research}} in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population, and on 28 September 1838 he noted its assertion that human [...] "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a geometric progression so that population soon exceeds food supply {{in what is}} known as a Malthusian catastrophe. Darwin was well prepared to compare this to de Candolle's [...] "warring of the species" [...] of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the [...] "final cause of all this <b>wedging,</b> must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes", so that [...] "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."

500|$|A {{cold front}} {{is located at}} {{the leading edge of the}} {{temperature}} drop off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. [...] Cold fronts often bring heavy thunderstorms, rain and hail. [...] Cold fronts can produce sharper changes in weather and move up to twice as quickly as warm fronts, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly replaces the warm air preceding the boundary. On weather maps, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangle-shaped pips pointing in the direction of travel, and it is placed at the leading edge of the cooler air mass. Cold fronts come in association with a low-pressure area. The concept of colder, dense air [...] "wedging" [...] under the less dense warmer air is often used to depict how air is lifted along a frontal boundary. The cold air <b>wedging</b> underneath warmer air creates the strongest winds just above the ground surface, a phenomenon often associated with property-damaging wind gusts. [...] This lift would then form a narrow line of showers and thunderstorms if enough moisture were present. However, this concept isn't an accurate description of the physical processes; upward motion is not produced because of warm air [...] "ramping up" [...] cold, dense air, rather, frontogenetical circulation is behind the upward forcing.|$|E
