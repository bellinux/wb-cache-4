5|$|Bennett {{remained}} {{active in}} the military, continuing to serve {{as part of the}} Militia, which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the demobilisation process. From then until 1926, he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade, before being appointed to command the 2nd Division. In 1930, he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps. He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932.

5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a genial and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.|$|E

5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the supreme}} {{director}} Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed {{a commission to}} discuss the case of Saavedra.

The commission restored Saavedra <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> rank of brigadier, and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during the time he was demoted. A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra's losses, but he considered it a token of his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E
5|$|French {{civilian}} administrators struggled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> leaders, {{and the two}} forces {{went through}} a number of leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892.

Archinard's campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without civilian oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard's control over the area with a civilian governor, Louis Albert Grodet.|$|E
