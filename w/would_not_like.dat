5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

25|$|During the {{development}} of the first anime, Arakawa allowed the anime staff to work independently from her, and requested a different ending from that of the manga. She said that she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to repeat the same ending in both media, and wanted to make the manga longer so she could develop the characters. When watching the ending of the anime, she was amazed about how different the homunculi creatures were from the manga and enjoyed how the staff speculated about the origins of the villains. Because Arakawa helped the Bones staff in the making of the series, she was kept from focusing on the manga's cover illustrations and had little time to make them.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

The generational {{difference}} was strengthened by Ellington being a guiding figure for the other two, who were born when Ellington was becoming an influence on music. In 1962, Ellington did not have a recording contract, while Mingus was signed to United Artists. According to Roach, the three musicians met the day before the recording, and Ellington told them to [...] "Think of me as the poor man's Bud Powell" [...] and that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to play only his own material.|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} {{recording}} session on 6 June 1962, Martin had one reservation, {{as he felt}} that using an experienced studio session drummer would improve the recording, rather than using Pete Best (this was normal practice at the time). Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison asked Epstein to sack Best when they learned that Martin wanted to replace him on their recordings. Epstein agonised about the decision, asking The Cavern Club's DJ Bob Wooler {{if it was a}} good idea. Wooler replied that Best was [...] "very popular with the fans" [...] who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> it at all. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August, over two and half months after the first recording session at EMI studios. Best was never given an explanation for his dismissal.|$|E

Then-U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and Hector P. Garcia, the Mexican-American World War II veteran who founded the American G.I. Forum, intervened on Longoria's behalf. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, Congressman John Lyle, and President Truman's military aide Gen. Harry H. Vaughan joined the Longoria family for a full military burial with honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 16, 1949. Johnson stated of the incident, [...] "This injustice and prejudice is deplorable.

500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who might have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. [...] "The Bill" [...] starred Shearsmith as Archie, Pemberton as Malcolm, Jason Watkins as Kevin, Philip Glenister as Craig, Ellie White as Anya and Callum Coates as Tim. Watkins had previously starred in Shearsmith and Pemberton's Psychoville; though the pair generally have a rule against reusing actors from Psychoville in Inside No. 9, so as [...] "to keep surprising and avoid familiarity", they broke their rule [...] "because [...] brilliant". Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith work hard to make roles attractive to accomplished actors, claiming that Glenister had hoped he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the script, looking for an excuse to turn down a week's work in his busy schedule.|$|E

500|$|Conrad Hall was not {{the first}} choice for {{director}} of photography; Mendes believed he was [...] "too old and too experienced" [...] to want the job, and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with. Instead, Mendes asked Fred Elmes, who turned the job down because he did not like the script. Hall was recommended to Mendes by Tom Cruise, because of Hall's work on Without Limits(1998), which Cruise had executive produced. Mendes was directing Cruise's then-wife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room during preproduction on American Beauty, and had already storyboarded the whole film. Hall was involved for one month during preproduction; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script, and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting Mendes. Hall was initially concerned that audiences <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the characters; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals, which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals.|$|E
500|$|Outside Japan, {{the game}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, which primarily {{focused on the}} changes in the game from its predecessor. Reviewers generally praised the graphics.

Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com disagreed, however, saying that the art [...] "represents a step back from the splendor of Final Fantasy XIII".

Patrick Gann of the role-playing video game news website RPGFan called it [...] "a no-questions-asked kind of purchase", praising {{in particular the}} variety of the pieces and the contrasts between the different styles. Jayson Napolitano of the video game music news website Original Sound Version concurred, calling it [...] "a fantastic soundtrack" [...] with eclectic styles, and noting Mizuta's contributions as his best work to date. Original Sound Version later named the album as the best soundtrack of 2011. Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online, another video game music news website, was not as enthusiastic about the album as other reviewers, as he felt {{that some of the}} more experimental tracks missed the mark, but was still positive about the album as a whole. He considered the soundtrack [...] "a fresh sound for the series", and agreed with Napolitano that Mizuta's contributions were noteworthy for the composer.

500|$|In February 2009, Lovato {{started to}} work and {{recorded}} on her second album, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato explained about the album's process and collaborating with songwriters from the album including Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks, noting that she [...] "basically went from full time acting mode to full time album mode". As she wanted to accomplish more [...] "John Mayer-ish type of songs", she contacted Mayer's management in order to collaborate him, citing {{him as one of}} her biggest musical influences. Mayer accepted the offer, of which Lovato said, [...] "I was completely shocked [...] It was more of a pipe dream. I didn't ever {{think it would be a}} reality, but it came true. He was taking a chance on working with a younger artist in the pop realm." [...] The two wrote three songs together, [...] "World of Chances", [...] "Love is the Answer" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Love Me". Lovato said that it was intimidating to work with him as she was worried that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> her lyrics, and she would get [...] "super excited" [...] whenever he complimented her. [...] "World of Chances", the first song she wrote with Mayer, was the only of these songs to make the album's final cut. The song was inspired by Lovato's first experience of love and heartbreak.|$|E
500|$|While {{the album}} was {{immersed}} further into mainstream R territory, Carey included some of her classic ballads and tender love songs on the album, working with writers and producers such as David Foster and Diane Warren. The idea to work with Warren was suggested by Foster, who thought that the two {{would be able to}} [...] "hammer out one hell of a ballad" [...] together. The two wrote and produced the song titled [...] "After Tonight." [...] Carey felt the song was a perfect metaphor for her relationship with Miguel, describing their romance in Capri. While the song was deemed a success by both parties, they described their working relationship with mixed feelings. According to Foster, who was involved in the writing session, Carey and Warren would not always agree on the lyrics and melodious structure of the song. He described it as a [...] "give and take relationship"; Warren would offer lyrics and Carey <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> them; she wanted something more intricate and detailed. Carey would produce a hook or lyrics that Warren did not feel were a perfect fit. In the end, Foster felt that they worked [...] "well together". After recording the song, Carey invited Miguel to record the song with her as a duet. However, after recording his verses several times, Foster and Carey realized that the song would not turn out the way they planned. Foster said the song's key was [...] "too high for him"; the voices did not harmonize well. Carey did not have time to re-record her vocals in a lower key to accommodate Miguel's verses. Miguel, furious over the failed collaboration, later sent a cut-up tape of the demo to Foster. Carey, Warren, and Foster also wrote [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)," [...] one of the other ballads featured on Rainbow.|$|E
