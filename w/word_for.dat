30|$|Classifying single reviews as {{positive}} or negative, the F 1 -scores are: labMT 0.63, ANEW 0.36, LIWC 0.53, MPQA 0.66, OL 0.71, and WK 0.34 (see Table S 4). We roughly confirm a rule-of-thumb that 10, 000 words {{are enough to}} score with a sentiment dictionary confidently, with all dictionaries except MPQA and ANEW achieving 90 % accuracy with this many words. We sample the number of reviews evenly in log space, generating sets of reviews with average word counts of 4, 550, 6, 500, 9, 750, 16, 250, and 26, 000 words. Specifically, the number of reviews necessary to achieve 90 % accuracy is 15 reviews (9, 750 <b>words)</b> <b>for</b> labMT, 100 reviews (65, 000 <b>words)</b> <b>for</b> ANEW, 10 reviews (6, 500 <b>words)</b> <b>for</b> LIWC, 10 reviews (6, 500 <b>words)</b> <b>for</b> MPQA, 7 reviews (4, 550 <b>words)</b> <b>for</b> OL, and 25 reviews (16, 250 <b>words)</b> <b>for</b> WK.|$|R

In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev gave it the provisional name ekamanganese (from eka-, the Sanskrit <b>word</b> <b>for</b> one) because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed {{the problem of how}} to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin <b>word</b> <b>for</b> head and cauda the Latin <b>word</b> <b>for</b> tail.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too {{has always had}} a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was adorned with a lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the <b>word</b> <b>for</b> king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with the <b>word</b> <b>for</b> lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence for the use of a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E
