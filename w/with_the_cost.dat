Petty Officer Edward Carbullido (pictured), who had been born on Guam but had not returned home for 14 years, was asked to identify his parents' house through the periscope while the boat remained submerged in Agat Bay.

The riot and rooftop protest ended on 25 April when the final five prisoners were removed from the rooftop, making it the longest prison riot in British penal history.

5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough to keep up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E
5|$|According to Johnson, filming did {{not begin}} until April 1965, one year after {{approval}} of the script, with J. Hoberman reporting a slightly earlier date of September 1964 {{for the start of}} filming in his film essay for the Criterion collection release of the film. The initial budget was 1.6million Rubles, but it was cut several times to one million Rubles (In comparison, Sergei Bondarchuk's War and Peace had a budget of eight and half million Rubles). As a result of the budget restrictions several scenes from the script were cut, including an opening scene showing the Battle of Kulikovo. Other scenes that were cut from the script are a hunting scene, where the younger brother of the Grand Prince hunts swans, and a scene showing peasants helping Durochka giving birth to her Russian-Tatar child. In the end the film cost 1.3million Rubles, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> overrun due to heavy snowfall, which disrupted shooting from November 1965 until April 1966. The film was shot on location, on the Nerl River and the historical places of Vladimir/Suzdal, Pskov, Izborsk and Pechory.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} inspection in October 1950 {{reported that it}} would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have a better chance of attracting assistance from Main Roads. The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main Roads for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main Roads therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main Roads believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E

5|$|Control of the {{building}} project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, {{at a time of}} increasing costs. Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.|$|E
5|$|Financing of {{the venue}} was officially {{granted by the}} Parliament of Norway in April 1990. The International Skating Union wanted to locate all skating in Hamar, and in October 1990, LOOC {{confirmed}} that they would reallocate the events {{so that all the}} all skating events would take place in Hamar, and that a separate Olympic Village would be built in Hamar for skaters. The original plans for the Olympic Amphitheatre called for a capacity for 4,500 and construction to cost NOK65. By June 1991, LOOC decided to increase the size of the venue, as IOC would only allow the venue host figure skating if its spectator capacity was raised to 6,000. Financing of the expansion was granted in August, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> rising to NOK83.3 million. Early plans called for the venue to be built in concrete, but a research project coordinated by the Norwegian Institute of Technology made it possible to cover the venue's exterior and interior in wood panel. This solution was hailed as aesthetical by architects, and as a technical innovation by the Norwegian construction industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E

Preparation for filming began on April 7, 2010 in Northwest Indiana, specifically around Gary, which portrayed Ukraine in the film. Principal photography commenced on May 18, 2010, with shooting locations including Chicago, Florida, and Moscow. The first six weeks were spent in Los Angeles: locations included Sherman Oaks, Fourth Avenue, and 5. Main. The next four weeks were spent in Chicago. Locations filmed in Chicago included LaSalle Street, Michigan Avenue, Bacino's of Lincoln Park at 2204 North Lincoln Avenue, and areas surrounding the Willis Tower. The scenes set in Michigan Ave featured {{a substantial amount of}} pyrotechnics and stunt work. Filming in Detroit was planned to take place in August but the Chicago shoot was extended until September 1. In late-September, the production moved to Florida, just before the launch of Space Shuttle mission STS-133.|$|E
5|$|Wave action took {{a toll on}} the {{foundations}} of waterfront structures along the coasts of Baldwin and Mobile counties, where Elena inflicted about $715,000 worth of damage to roadways. Most damage was concentrated near the shore, where extensive erosion took place, and on islands and minor peninsulas. Farther inland, Elena's impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines. The storm destroyed the city boardwalk at Gulf Shores, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of rebuilding expected to approach $300,000. Alabama Power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100,000 customers. According to the Insurance Information Institute, storm-related damages in Alabama totaled about $100 million.
