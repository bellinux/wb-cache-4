25|$|The first {{emanation}} is Nous (Divine Mind, Logos, Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically {{with the}} Demiurge in Plato's Timaeus. It {{is the first}} Will toward Good. From Nous proceeds the World Soul, which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with nature. From the world soul proceeds individual human souls, and finally, matter, at {{the lowest level of}} being and thus the least perfected level of the cosmos. Despite this relatively pedestrian assessment of the material world, Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of nous and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that <b>we</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> One, in material things and then in the Forms.|$|E
25|$|Slave Cage: Back at the Archers' Den, the Death Machine {{has been}} {{completed}} and the enslaved former citizens of the Empire (including the captured Nursemaid and Valets) toil away in the mines. The Evil Counselor and his son now sense that they have enough support and admiration amongst the Archers’ forcing them to capture the Chief Archer and assuming command of the Archers' forces. The fiendish Death Machine (Wheel of Death) is powered by slaves running in hamster-wheel cages {{on both ends of}} a long rotating pendulum arm. <b>We</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> two slaves in the Wheel of Death as former members of the Imperial Court. While operating the machine, the slaves escape out of the cage and brazenly taunt their captives by performing elaborate and dangerous stunts on the moving Death Machine. The enslaved Empire is inspired by the courage of the two slaves and while the Archers are distracted by the events, the Empire rises up and revolts against its captors. The bravery of the two slaves in the Wheel of Death begins to turn the tide in the war. In the conclusion, the Chief Archer’s daughter is able to rescue her father from captivity and the Twins are finally reunited.|$|E

500|$|In late September {{or early}} October 1942, Popovac met with Chetnik leaders Dobroslav Jevđević and Petar Baćović. The three agreed {{to form a}} Muslim Chetnik militia. In October, Popovac enlisted Italian aid in {{fighting}} the Partisans. Popovac's Muslim Chetniks were soon [...] "legalized" [...] by the Italians and listed {{as part of their}} Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia ( [...] ; MVAC). Popovac and Pašić became the political leaders of the Muslim Chetniks, whose militia was formally called the Muslim People's Military Organization ( [...] ; MNVO). Musakadić was appointed the military leader of all the Muslim Chetniks. Another Muslim, Mustafa Mulalić, became the vice-chairman of the Chetnik's Central National Committee. The creation of the MNVO complied with the Chetniks' strategy of turning the Croats and Muslims of eastern Herzegovina against one another. According to Marko Attila Hoare, a historian specializing in the Balkans, the MNVO was part of a greater Muslim autonomist movement. In September 1942, an assembly of Herzegovinian Muslim notables in Mostar declared: [...] "We Herzegovinians and Bosnians are nobody's property and <b>we</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> right of nobody to persecute us.

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schopenhauer's {{notion of}} the will comes from the Kantian thing-in-itself, which Kant {{believed to be the}} fundamental reality behind the representation that provided the matter of perception, but lacked form. Kant believed that space, time, causation, and many other similar phenomena belonged properly to the form imposed on the world by the human mind in order to create the representation, and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, so the thing-in-itself must be one and all things that exist, including human beings, must be part of this fundamental unity. [...] Our inner-experience must be a manifestation of the noumenal realm and the will is the inner kernel of every being.

Wade has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it, and I sustain and support that law, and the right of a woman to make that choice, and my personal beliefs, like the personal beliefs of other people, should not be brought into a political campaign." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hepburn {{was noted}} for her fashion choices and {{distinctive}} look, {{to the extent}} that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand. When she first rose to stardom in Roman Holiday (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than to men, in comparison to the curvy and more sexual Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor. With her short hair style, thick eyebrows, slim body and [...] "gamine" [...] looks, she presented a look which young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars. In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the [...] "public embodiment of our new feminine ideal" [...] in Vogue, and wrote that [...] "Nobody ever looked like her before World War II ... Yet <b>we</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared." [...] The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade.

Cf. Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 434 (1952) [...] The taxpayers therefore seek not to 'extend' Flast ...but merely to apply it. When executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax money for religious purposes, no less than when Congress authorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury. And once <b>we</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> injury as sufficient for Article III, there can be no serious question about the other elements of the standing enquiry: the injury is indisputably 'traceable' to the spending, and 'likely to be redressed by' an injunction prohibiting it. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984)".

2500|$|Legio Maria {{developed}} gradually {{and eventually}} separated from mainstream Roman Catholicism in 1963. What is now Legio Maria started from the Catholic lay movement {{as far back}} as 1938-1940. Central to its formation are the local Luo myths about a mystery woman, min Omolo Ka-Nyunja, who walked Luo land during these years. A number of Legio Maria faithfuls believe that this woman was responsible for the mythical stories such as Nyamgondho Kombare in Gwassi, Homa Bay County, and Simbi Nyaima in Karachuonyo, Homa Bay County. According to Tobias Oloo, a Legio Maria Deacon and researcher, [...] "every religion has mythical elements and the Legio Maria movement's development relied massively on the crystallization of local myths with their beliefs." [...] Apart from the myths that probably preceded Legio Maria, Deacon Oloo affirms that the Fátima Visitation of Virgin Mary was a key ingredient to the formation of Legio Maria. [...] "As legios, <b>we</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> three Fatima mysteries. However, the most important for us is the third mystery which predicted the appearance of Our Lord in the 1960s. Though this mystery is controversial because the Roman Catholic did not reveal it for generations and what they eventually revealed is still contested by many Christians, we have faith that through the third mystery Mary promised the coming of Simeo Ondetto." ...|$|E
