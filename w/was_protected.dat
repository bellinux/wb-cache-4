5|$|Amenartas – {{an ancient}} Egyptian priestess and ancestress of the Vincey family. As a priestess of Isis, she <b>was</b> <b>protected</b> {{from the power}} of She.

5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who <b>was</b> <b>protected</b> by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who <b>was</b> <b>protected</b> by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E

50|$|The act has {{received}} many critiques {{about what people}} <b>are</b> <b>protected,</b> and what <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> by the clause.

The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|A set of plaques {{was added}} to the south of the {{memorial}} in 1949, commemorating the 29,924 Royal Artillerymen who were killed in the Second World War.

50|$|Galvanizing, {{while using}} the {{electrochemical}} principle of cathodic protection, is not actually cathodic protection. Cathodic protection requires the anode to be {{separate from the}} metal surface to <b>be</b> <b>protected,</b> with an ionic connection through the electrolyte and an electron connection through a connecting cable, bolt or similar. This means that any area of the protected structure within the electrolyte can <b>be</b> <b>protected,</b> whereas {{in the case of}} galvanizing, only areas very close to the zinc <b>are</b> <b>protected.</b> Hence, a larger area of bare steel would only <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> around the edges.|$|R
