5|$|In {{addition}} to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM, and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the tank-style controls to a point and click-style interface. Schafer noted they created the game with tank-style control as it was popular with other games like Resident Evil at the time, but recognized it did not work <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the point-and-click modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version.|$|E

5|$|Pallas is {{farther from}} Earth {{and has a}} much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth.

5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E

40|$|This {{engineering}} {{study provides}} {{an evaluation of}} existing wells and boreholes (<b>wells)</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> proposed location for the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Privatization Phase 1 demonstration site. Phase 1 {{is part of the}} TWRS program that was established to manage, retrieve, treat, immobilize, and dispose of high-level waste stored in underground tanks at the Hanford Site. This evaluation is to determine which wells will remain active <b>within</b> <b>the</b> demonstration site based on regulatory, programmatic, or other beneficial use requirements. An initial evaluation of <b>wells</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> demonstration site was conducted in 1996. However, changes in construction plans and expansion of the demonstration site necessitated a reevaluation and reclassification of <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> that are <b>within</b> <b>the</b> expanded site. Impacted wells include many of those previously evaluated as well as additional wells identified in or near the expansion areas. Thirty-three <b>wells</b> exist <b>within</b> and immediately adjacent to the identified boundary of the proposed demonstration site. The wells identified for decommissioning will be abandoned according to the well decommissioning plan. Future <b>well</b> requirements <b>within</b> <b>the</b> site include replacement wells for those wells impacted by construction activities, replacements for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) wells going dry, and a new characterization well installed to support a TWRS Phase 2 site assessment...|$|R
5|$|By this time, Wang's {{only hope}} for rescue was an {{intervention}} by Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620. For Dou, the situation, as presented by his councillor Liu Bin, offered both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, {{it would be easy}} to oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation was critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang. Dou's army was a huge force, reportedly over 100,000 strong, and the two earliest sources report 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> capabilities of the time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{between the}} brigade and {{battalion}} headquarters and the forward company positions broke down {{at this stage}} and runners had to be despatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and {{had run out of}} water. The water situation was solved by digging a <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> perimeter, but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of Matilda tanks under Major Kenneth Arnott from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and {{over the course of the}} day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable move under their own power.|$|E

There is a record from the Orinoco Delta of northeastern Venezuela, <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> range of Hylaeamys megacephalus, but Musser and colleagues suggest that this is based on mislabeled specimens. The species has also been found on the narrow strip between the Llanos and the Andes (Cordillera Oriental and Cordillera de Mérida) in eastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. The unforested Llanos separate these areas from Hylaeamys populations. Hylaeamys perenensis does, however, occur further south along the eastern foothills of the Cordillera Oriental in Colombia and it is possible that the two overlap in this area.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11d is an {{exoplanet}} {{discovered in}} the orbit of the sun-like star Kepler-11. It is named for the telescope that discovered it, a NASA spacecraft named Kepler {{that is designed to}} detect Earth-like planets by measuring small dips in the brightness of their host stars as the planets cross in front. This process, known as the transit method, was used to note the presence of six planets in orbit around Kepler-11, of which Kepler-11d is the third from its star. Kepler-11d orbits Kepler-11 <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> orbit of Mercury approximately every 23 days. The planet is approximately six times more massive than the Earth, and has a radius that is three and a half times larger than that of Earth's. It is, however, far hotter than Earth is. Its low density, comparable to that of Saturn, suggests that Kepler-11d has a large hydrogen–helium atmosphere. Kepler-11d was announced with its five sister planets on February 2, 2011 after extensive follow-up studies.|$|E
5|$|The French cruiser De Grasse {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Lorient {{shipyard}} in Lorient in November 1938. Work on the unfinished ship stopped following the German conquest of France in May 1940. In 1942, the Kriegsmarine considered several proposals to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary aircraft carrier. The final proposal was completed by August 1942, but work on the conversion did not last long. By February 1943, the project had been abandoned, for several reasons. The shipyard suffered from a shortage of labor and materials, and the design staff had significant concerns over {{the arrangement of the}} engine system. The Allies also posed a serious threat, as Lorient was <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> range of Allied bombers. The ship was eventually retaken by the French Navy {{after the end of the}} war, and launched in 1946. She was ultimately completed in 1956 as an anti-aircraft cruiser.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{official}} {{end of the}} Atlantic hurricane season occurs on November30, the dates of October31 and November15 have also historically marked {{the official}} end date for the hurricane season. December, the only {{month of the year}} after the hurricane season, has featured the cyclogenesis of fourteen tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 was the latest tropical cyclone to attain tropical storm intensity as it did so on December30. However, the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 was the latest forming tropical cyclone to attain hurricane intensity. Both Zeta and Alice were the only two storms to exist in two calendar years– the former from 1954 to 1955 and the latter from 2005 to 2006. No storms have been recorded to exceed Category1 hurricane intensity in December. In 1999, Hurricane Lenny reached Category4 intensity on November17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across the Caribbean; its intensity made it the latest developing Category4 hurricane, though this was <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> bounds of the hurricane season. Hurricane Hattie (October 27-November 1, 1961) was initially thought to have been the latest forming Category5 hurricane ever documented, though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date. Consequently, this made the hurricane the latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale classifications past Category1 intensity.|$|E

5|$|Expecting a Polish counter-attack, Russian {{engineers}} {{started to}} repair Forts 54 and 55. Initially only Polish artillery from forts 73, 21, 22 and 23 responded with fire, while Dembiński's reserves remained passive. Seeing no activity on Polish side, Russian II Infantry Corps' artillery started supporting its neighbours of the I Infantry Corps. Russian artillery suffered some losses, but its superiority was evident. Batteries of the I Corps approached Fort 57 to within , which forced the Polish artillery to be dismantled and {{withdrawn from the}} fort. Around 8:00 two columns of the I Corps (under Alexander von Lüders and Ivan Nabokov) assaulted the fort. Elements of four Russian regiments (3rd and 4th Marine Regiments, 7th 'Revelski' Infantry Regiment and Moskovsky Regiment) stormed the fort from three sides, hoping a three-hour artillery barrage had destroyed the obstacles and palisade guarding the entry to Polish positions. The stockade was almost intact and Russian forces suffered considerable losses, both from small-arms fire and from artillery of the 2nd line. The officers ordered a retreat, but the soldiers disregarded the order and continued to assault the fort on their own. Several assaults were repelled with heavy Russian losses. Despite the losses, Russian infantry entered the fort and captured it in a close quarters fight, without a shot fired. Only about 80 Poles were taken captive, and four managed to retreat to the Polish lines with their wounded commanding officer; the remainder fought on and were killed almost to the last man. As the recently captured fort was <b>well</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> range of Polish artillery, the Russians withdrew and started hiding behind it.|$|E
