5|$|In {{preparation}} for these new requirements, Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of Europe. One {{of these was}} the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on 16 January 1992 and immediately reactivated as the 555th Engineer Group. On 16 February 1992 the 210th Field Artillery Brigade, also from Europe, was activated. In 1997, the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to Fort Bliss, Texas, to join other air defense brigades. The corps and Fort Lewis would see a reshuffling of units {{in and out of}} the area through 2000. Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region. Plans exist for I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of Japan or South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were among}} the favourites to win the {{competition}} while Ajax were virtually unknown outside of the Netherlands. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly had made a scouting trip to watch Ajax before the match and witnessing them lose to lowly opposition returned confident Liverpool would progress. A few of Liverpool's players, including striker Roger Hunt, were part of England's victorious World Cup campaign in 1966. Ajax <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of a poor period, after they had finished in 13th place in the 1964–65 Eredivisie, while the Netherlands national team had yet to make an impression on the international stage. The board of Ajax decided to hire Rinus Michels. He changed the team's formation to a 4–2–4, {{with an emphasis on}} passing and possession of the ball. The team showed improvement, winning the Eredivisie in his first season in charge.|$|E

25|$|Because Knight {{worked in}} an era when new and often fragmentary fossils <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of the American west in quantity, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence; dinosaurs such as his improbably-adorned Agathaumas (1897) for example, were {{somewhat}} speculative. His depictions of better-known ceratopsians as solitary animals inhabiting lush grassy landscapes were largely imaginative (the grasslands that feature in many of his paintings didn't appear until the Cenozoic).|$|E
25|$|Black-and-white film in {{that era}} was {{sensitive}} to blue light, not the reds and oranges of hot steel, {{so she could see}} the beauty, but the photographs <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> all black. She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of magnesium flare, which produces white light, and having assistants hold them to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted in some of the best steel factory photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.|$|E
25|$|The era's {{competing}} {{systems from}} Sony and Sega (the PlayStation and Saturn, respectively) used CD-ROM discs to store their games. As a result, game developers who had traditionally supported Nintendo game consoles were now developing {{games for the}} competition. Some third-party developers, such as Square and Enix, whose Final Fantasy VII and Dragon Warrior VII were initially planned for the Nintendo 64, switched to the PlayStation, citing the insufficient storage capacity of the N64 cartridges. Some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64; Konami released fifty PlayStation games, but only thirteen for the Nintendo 64. New Nintendo 64 game releases were infrequent while new games <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> rapidly for the PlayStation.|$|E

25|$|In that era, {{there was}} social unrest in the country. Not {{only was the}} women's {{suffrage}} movement gaining momentum in Canada and calls <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of the prairies for socialist changes to the governmental system, but war continued to rage around the world. Canada was providing troops and supplies, and shortly after his installation, acting {{on the advice of}} Borden, Devonshire introduced conscription, a decision that was particularly divisive between French and English Canadians and sparked the Conscription Crisis of 1917. In the same year, the Governor General also travelled to Nova Scotia to survey the damage caused by the Halifax Explosion on 6 December; there he met with survivors and addressed the women of the Voluntary Aid Detachment.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} games (in content, graphics, and sound) pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers {{was that they}} could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, such as Squaresoft, whose Final Fantasy VII, and Enix (later merged with Squaresoft to create Square Enix), whose Dragon Quest VII titles were initially pre-planned for the N64; while some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). While new games <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> rapidly for the PlayStation, new Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent and that system's biggest successes were developed by either Nintendo itself or by second-parties, such as Rare. The lower production costs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of titles which had already recouped their development costs.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E

500|$|By 22:15, Lützow had shipped nearly 2,400tons of water, and {{the ship}} was dangerously down by the bows. After midnight, {{attempts}} were made to steer the ship in reverse. This failed when the bow became submerged enough to bring the stern out of the water; by 02:20, the screws and both rudders <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of the water {{and the ship}} was no longer able to steer. The order to abandon ship was given, and at 02:47, Lützow was sunk by the torpedo boat [...] The ship was lost because the flooding in the bow could not be controlled; the forward pump system failed and the central system could not keep up with the rising water. The crew was picked up by four torpedo boats that had been escorting the crippled battlecruiser; during the battle the ship suffered 116 men killed.|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin and was {{produced}} by Madonna and Pettibone. The song was recorded at Sound Works Studios in Astoria, New York, and samples a hook from LL Cool J's single, [...] "Jingling Baby" [...] (1990). Pettibone also did the sequencing, the keyboard arrangement and the programming for the track with Shimkin. Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock were the recording engineers for the track while George Karras was the mixing engineer. Ted Jensen did the mastering for the song with Mark Goodman as assistant engineer. Background vocals were provided by Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. For [...] "Bye Bye Baby", Madonna and Pettibone wanted a 1940s theme, which would make the vocals sound as if they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of an antique radio. In order to achieve that, they used a Pultec HLF filter. Shimkin recalled that the vocals for [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] were from the first take. He added that the filtered vocal effect were applied during recording and played with while Madonna {{was in front of}} the microphone singing.|$|E
500|$|Sex {{has also}} become an {{important}} book in the LGBT community. Ben Shapiro, author of Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future, wrote that due to its iconic status [...] "Sex adorns the coffee tables of hundreds of gay men and sperm banks". Mark Blankenship, from the LGBT-oriented website New Now Next stated that [...] "literature changed forever" [...] with the publishing of Sex. Madonna's portrayal of lesbian love scenes in the book sparked debates about her own sexual orientation. This was an adjunct to the singer's public relationship with comedian Sandra Bernhard, with whom she cavorted around, visiting lesbian night-clubs as well as partying. The LGBT community felt {{it was an important}} portrayal for them. They debated whether Madonna was [...] "ripping" [...] them off for publicity. As Carolin Grace from Diva magazine noted: [...] "Madonna became meaningful in early nineties, when Sex came out, and at that point lesbian culture was really changing." [...] She noted how women <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> about their sexuality and the book's handling of the taboo issue were [...] "a legacy, our contribution to the show. The lesbian sub-cultural references borrowed by Madonna aren't our only possessions." [...] O'Brien argues in her book , that the book had a confusing philosophy. According to the female critics, who pointed out the vacuousness of Madonna's remarks about porn and abuse, the singer did not have a correct idea that behind these fantasies the [...] "reality is too hard for her to endure", referring to the daily hustles that women have to face at red light districts and brothels. The author felt that despite the courageous premise of genuine exploration of queer sex, the book crossed over into pornography and a wrong portrayal for the community, while being flippant and commercial. She drew an example of the death of pornographic actor Joey Stefano, one of the models of the book, from drug overdose. Stefano had been thrilled {{to be a part of}} the book, but was underpaid. Once Madonna and her team were done with the shoot, [...] "they packed up and left the Gaiety... They left behind the mundane reality and the boys who have to deal with it seven days a week." ...|$|E

Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck had given me such a fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime.

2500|$|In the U.S., [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] {{was issued}} as the album's first single, with an {{accompanying}} music video. Initially, the album and single lingered {{for almost a}} year without performing well, but when Geffen founder David Geffen was asked to lend support to the band, he obliged, personally convincing MTV executives to play [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] during the network's after-hours rotation. Even though the video was initially only played once at 4 a.m. on a Sunday, heavy metal and hard rock fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en masse. The song, written in Seattle, was about Los Angeles. The music video took place in New York. According to Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a homeless man while they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of a bus into New York. Trying to put a scare into the young runaways, the man yelled at them, [...] "You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby; you're gonna die!"

2500|$|Murphy {{received}} principal {{credit for}} the dominance of American athletes between the 1890s and the Stockholm Olympics. The praise for Murphy {{was so great that}} a backlash developed among westerners who felt that, though many of the country's greatest athletes <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of the Midwest, the Eastern establishment sought to heap all of the credit on Murphy. For example, during the 1912 Olympics, the Minneapolis Journal noted that Murphy was not responsible for developing Midwestern stars Jim Thorpe and Ralph Craig and wrote:"They are still at it down East, attempting to grab off the glory for the splendid work of the American athletes in the Olympic games as the personal due of Mike Murphy. ... Mike Murphy is unquestionably a great trainer, but he falls far short of deserving all the {{credit for the}} winning of the Olympic games. ... It is an injustice to other less-famed trainers to have their products blandly attributed to Murphy as some of the eastern writers, with their usual provincial complacency, are doing. Murphy is big enough and well enough known by past performances as a trainer to stand upon his own merits without having his misguided friends attempt to seize for him leaves of a bay rightfully belonging to other men." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively.

[...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... the kids <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of the seats and standing in the aisles to come up and rock out with us...
