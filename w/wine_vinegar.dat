The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with <b>wine</b> <b>vinegar</b> and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E

Understanding the betrayal, Ben-Hur is spotted by a priest who tries to take him into custody; he breaks away and flees. When morning comes, Ben-Hur learns that the Jewish priests have tried Jesus before Pilate. Although originally acquitted, Jesus has been sentenced to crucifixion at the crowd's demand. Ben-Hur is shocked at how his supporters have deserted Christ in his time of need. They head to Calvary, and Ben-Hur resigns himself to watch the crucifixion of Jesus. The sky darkens.

25|$|Nevertheless, {{thanks to}} the {{importance}} of the French market to the Dutch, {{and the fact that the}} Dutch had less possibilities of imposing counter-pressure than they had in their conflicts with the English, the Dutch government at first tried to ignore the hostile policies of Colbert. Its inaction was also caused by differences of opinion about how best to proceed within the States Party. Amsterdam, and especially the Amsterdam diplomat Coenraad van Beuningen, argued in favor of firm economic counter-measures against the French economic policies, paired with the forming of a defensive alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. De Witt, however, preferred avoiding such foreign entanglements, and a conciliatory approach in the economic sphere. As their economic interests were severely damaged by the French protectionism, the industrial cities of Leiden and Haarlem, however, teamed up with Amsterdam to support a more belligerent diplomacy. After the Rotterdam regents were promised compensation for the damage to their wine trade, to get their assent, the States of Holland decided in 1671 on severe retaliatory measures against French imports, in effect banning French <b>wine,</b> <b>vinegar,</b> paper, and sail-canvas.

Three spectrophotometers were evaluated for this purpose: two monochromator instruments (Foss NIRSystems 6500 SY-I and Foss NIRSystems 6500 SY-II; spectral range 400 – 2, 500 nm in both cases) and a diode-array instrument (Corona 45 VIS/NIR; spectral range 380 – 1, 700 nm). A total of 70 samples were used to predict major chemical quality parameters (total acidity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, pH, dry extract, ash, acetoin, methanol, total polyphenols, color (tonality and intensity), and alcohol content), and to construct models for the classification of vinegars {{as a function of the}} manufacturing method used. The results obtained indicate that this non-invasive technology can be used successfully by the vinegar industry and by PDO regulators for the routine analysis of vinegars in order to authenticate them and to detect potential fraud. Slightly better results were achieved with the two monochromator instruments. The findings also highlight the potential of these NIR instruments for predicting the manufacturing process used, this being of particular value for the industrial authentication of traditional <b>wine</b> <b>vinegars...</b>|$|R

500|$|The post-colonial Anglo-Indian dish chicken tikka masala was {{apparently}} invented in Glasgow {{in the early}} 1970s, while balti cuisine was introduced to Britain in 1977 in Birmingham. In 2003, there were roughly 9000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in Britain. The majority of Indian restaurants in Britain are run by entrepreneurs of Bangladeshi (often Sylhet) and Pakistani origin. According to Britain's Food Standards Agency, the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom was worth £3.2 billion in 2003, accounting for two-thirds of all eating out, and serving about 2.5 million British customers every week. Indian restaurants typically allow the diner to combine base ingredients — chicken, prawns or [...] "meat" [...] (lamb or mutton) — with curry sauces — from the mild korma to the scorching phall — {{without regard to the}} authenticity of the combination. The reference point for flavour and spice heat is the Madras curry sauce (the name represents the area of India where restaurateurs obtained their spices, rather than an actual dish).

(One means of preparing Béarnaise, see below, is to start with Hollandaise and add the other ingredients.) Its name is related to the province of Béarn, France.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{a rising}} demand for novel food products, enriched with {{functional}} properties, and fruits {{as the main}} source of diversity for food formulations, this work focuses on the application of alcoholic and acetic fermentation processes to obtain novel food products with antioxidant potential. Besides generating differentiated food grade products, fermentation allows an extension of the shelf-life of the raw materials and the use of fruits not suitable for direct sale due to morphological nonconformities or advanced maturation. For this, we used industrially processed concentrates of orange, cherry, mango and banana to produce fruit <b>wines</b> and fruit <b>vinegars.</b> The use of concentrates allowed the production of fruit wines with ethanol yields between 8. 66 ± 0. 51 % (v/v) and 12. 79 ± 0. 23 % (v/v), with characteristics close to a wine grade product. From fruit <b>wines,</b> fruit <b>vinegars</b> were produced with total acidities close to 5 % as expected for this type of vinegar. Total antioxidant activity was assessed in the fruit <b>wines</b> and <b>vinegars</b> by FRAP, allowing an insight of fermentation impact on the antioxidant potential of the fermented fruit products. Orange and cherry <b>wines</b> and <b>vinegars</b> demonstrated higher antioxidant potential when compared with mango and banana <b>wines</b> and <b>vinegars.</b> Antioxidant activities in fruit wines ranged between 7144. 05 ± 770. 41 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for mango wine and 28040. 00 ± 1848. 10 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for cherry <b>wine.</b> In fruit <b>vinegars,</b> antioxidant activities ranged from 3700. 95 ± 349. 41 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for banana vinegar to 18563. 81 ± 2333. 94 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for cherry <b>vinegar.</b> Overall, fruit <b>wines</b> showed 0. 5 to 0. 9 folds higher antioxidant activities than the one reported as naturally occurring in the given fruits. Fermentation impact on antioxidant activity of fruits was low, being observed a reduction of total antioxidant activity from 0. 1 to 0. 2 folds during alcoholic fermentation and in a higher range from 0. 1 to 0. 5 folds in vinegars.
