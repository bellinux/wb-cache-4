5|$|The episode's script {{went through}} several {{different}} versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The decision to kill off the character of Catherine Black {{was based on a}} suggestion by Chris Carter, the series' creator. Morgan and Wong discussed the idea with actress Megan Gallagher, who felt that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> decision to have Catherine give her life after seeing Frank Black sacrifice so much for their family throughout the previous episodes. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. This sentiment was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck of the draw. Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E

25|$|The {{departure}} from Melbourne – {{just one year}} into a three-year deal with the club – {{was the end of}} a tumultuous period for Gleeson, who had been supporting his wife through a successful battle with breast cancer. Gleeson was left emotionally drained and on the lookout for his next professional challenge. For a time he found that challenge elsewhere, working with the Australian Football League's North Melbourne and Hawthorn football clubs as a skills coach during 2012–13. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> change of scenery and, in many ways, a year of growth for Gleeson. Under masterful coach Alastair Clarkson, Hawthorn was on the precipice of a golden era of premiership success and it was there that Gleeson learned some of the key elements of his current coaching philosophy. He learnt the importance of core sporting-team principles such as empowering players to lead a team's culture and standards.|$|E

Izzy <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> character because she was very emotional and insecure. That's what drove her evil ways. She {{had a bit of}} a soulmate in Paul."

500|$|The film's {{effects were}} conflictingly appraised. Schickel {{wrote that the}} effects were [...] "technically adroit" [...] and {{occasionally}} [...] "witty", and Ebert singled out the Bird of Prey as a [...] "great-looking" [...] ship. Sterritt felt that the settings always {{felt like they were}} on soundstages rather than out in space, and Denby wrote that more could have been done with Genesis, and that while it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> concept its special effects execution was lacking. Kempley appreciated the sets' low values, writing that [...] "the fakier the sets", the closer the film felt to its television origins.|$|E

Bernard Fanning also worked with Jordan on the film Ned Kelly in 2003. The band chose Jordan {{because they did not}} want to present These Days: Live in Concert as [...] "just straight-up live concert footage", but instead wanted to present it from a different angle. Jordan agreed, and believed that the band being a successful rock group from Brisbane <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> angle to work from.|$|E

Finally, he praised the Andy and Erin romancing, noting that it [...] "allows the writers to push a similar scenario [...] in a more overtly comic direction, while still getting some pathos out of it." [...] Gage Henry of Paste felt that the entry was a [...] "great way to dust off last week’s" [...] episode. He was pleased that it show-cased Michael as the [...] "all-knowing father figure whose mysterious ways pan out in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought {{it was interesting to}} show a little bit of Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things. It was a major feat, a real logical and creative feat, because you wanted it to look good".|$|E
500|$|Rippy {{used the}} Audiokinetic Wwise {{pipeline}} to create dynamic music that changes with {{the action in}} the game. Although Rippy used Wwise's tools only for dynamic music, they made audio system setup much easier than in previous Ensemble games. For each battle sequence, the musical cue was divided into sections and mixed differently for each section. [...] "When a cue is triggered, an intro plays and then the game randomly picks between all of those elements {{for as long as}} the battle continues," [...] Rippy explained. [...] "Once it's over, an outro plays and then it's back to the regular [...] "world" [...] music.

500|$|Sigourney Weaver, who {{had played}} Ripley {{throughout}} the series, wanted to liberate the character in Alien 3 as {{she did not want}} Ripley to become [...] "a figure of fun" [...] who would continuously [...] "wake up with monsters running around". The possibility of an Alien vs. Predator film was another reason for the character's death, as she thought the concept [...] "sounded awful". However, Weaver was impressed with Whedon's script. She thought that the error during Ripley's cloning process would allow her to further explore the character, since Ripley becoming part human and part Alien would create uncertainty about where her loyalties lay. This <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> concept to Weaver, who thought the film brought back the spirit of Alien and Aliens. Weaver received a co-producer credit and was reportedly paid $11million.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{felt that}} the main story {{employed}} [...] "one of the show's most reliable running jokes". Furthermore, he felt that Michael softening to Toby <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> element to the episode, {{and he wondered if}} [...] "this was a one-time thing, or if Michael's treatment of Toby will be softened, even a little." [...] Sepinwall also felt that Pam's story was the stronger of the two subplots, and felt that an office controlled by her would be interesting. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four out of five stars and called it [...] "pleasant". While he noted that each of the three stories [...] "weren't flat out funny", he wrote that they were all [...] "enjoyable". Furthermore, he positively commented on the main plot, noting that the Michael and Toby rivalry was fun.|$|E
500|$|Co-writer Howard Gordon {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Alex [...] and I made {{an effort}} to play to our own strength, which is character. We thought this <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> place to {{reiterate}} Mulder's quest for his sister. We set out to tell a simple abduction story, which was played out behind the shadows. We wanted to create an air of tension. With everything that happened, we wanted to explain what it could be. At every point, everything can be explained. Was she taken or killed by her boyfriend, who she was seeing against her mother's wishes? Is it Twin Peaks or an alien abduction? That was the theme of the show." [...] Gordon and Gansa were afraid that series creator Chris Carter would not like the script, but Carter liked the script and approved the episode they wrote.|$|E

But while Streep, for her part, knew the movie could be very successful, she felt the pay she was being offered for playing Miranda was [...] "slightly, if not insulting, not perhaps {{reflective}} of my actual value to the project." [...] The producers doubled it to around $4 million, and she signed on, allowing Fox to greenlight the film. According to Frankel, Streep saw the film {{as a chance to}} [...] "skewer the doyennes of the fashion world." [...] She has three daughters, and as an ardent feminist, felt that fashion magazines [...] "twisted the minds of young women around the world and their priorities. This <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> way to get back at them." [...] Also, she said, the film passed the Bechdel test.|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} new characters {{for the sixth}} season of Desperate Housewives, showrunner Marc Cherry and his writing staff aimed to create a housewife who would {{be different from the}} other female characters on the series. Cherry stated that he [...] "wanted someone who didn't seem suburban, who has a tough, blue-collar exterior." [...] The staff ultimately decided upon an Italian New Yorker. Cherry stated that part of his inspiration for the character came from his childhood neighbors. He explained, [...] "When I was growing up in Huntington, Calif., two Italian families from the Bronx moved in across the street. We were so WASPy, so middle American. They had their own ethnic identity. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> juxtaposition." [...] Cherry insisted that Angie was not replacing the deceased Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan) as a main housewife but would instead be the focus of the season's mystery.|$|E

Jared Leto said that while recording in Wyoming, [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> dichotomy, a kind of contradiction with the technology and the organic world that we were surrounded [...] It's something that I think ended up in the music". Ezrin helped the band to understand the importance of an album's structure and how to create a progression, rather than a simple series of singles. [...] "We really wanted to create something that had depth," [...] Leto explained. He described the process of working with Ezrin as tumultuous but also fulfilling, having its own dynamics.
