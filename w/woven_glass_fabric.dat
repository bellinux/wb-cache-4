40|$|In this work, {{tribological}} investigations on {{the neat}} polyester (NP) and woven (600 g/m 2) -glass fabric reinforced polyester (WGRP) composite were carried out. Friction and wear {{characteristics of the}} WGRP composite were measured in three principal orientations, i. e., sliding directions relative to the <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fabric</b> (WGF) orientations in the composites. These are longitudinal (L), transverse (T), and parallel (P) orientations. The experiments were conducted using a pin-on-disc (POD) machine under dry sliding conditions against a smooth stainless steel counterface. Results of friction coefficient and wear resistance of the composites were presented as function of normal loads (30 – 100 N) and sliding distances (0. 5 – 7 km) at different sliding velocities, 1. 7, 2. 8, and 3. 9 m/s. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the mechanisms of worn surfaces. Experimental results revealed that <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fabric</b> improved the tribological performance of neat polyester in all three tested orientations. In L-orientation, at a low velocity of 1. 7 m/s, WGRP exhibited significant improvements to wear resistance of the polyester composite compared to other orientations.

SEM microphotographs showed different damage features on the worn surfaces, i. e., deformation, cracks, debonding of fiber, and microcracks. <b>Woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fabric,</b> polyester, orientations, friction, wear...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent years, for {{the purpose}} of {{achieving}} enhanced mechanical properties of fiber reinforced composites, hybridized composites containing a combination of two or more types of fiber reinforcements have been explored. Perhaps the main parameter which controls the mechanical properties of the hybrid composites is the flexibility to arrange the hybrid fiber reinforcement layers {{in a variety of ways}} within the hybrid laminate. In this study, low velocity drop weight impact resistance of plain <b>weave</b> <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> and carbon hybrid composites has been investigated. The study explores the effects of intra-ply arrangement sequence on the impact resistance of 24 and 32 ply laminates in which glass and the carbon plies have been differently stacked. The results show that impact resistance of <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fiber composites can be enhanced by hybridizing <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fabrics</b> with <b>woven</b> carbon fabrics. The results indicate that the impact resistance is a function of the positions of the glass and carbon layers in the hybridized inter ply laminates...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} kinematics {{of engineering}} fabrics during the forming process {{is dominated by}} trellis shear. A coupling between shear compliance and in-plane tensile stress {{is to be expected}} in woven engineering fabrics [1 - 3]. As such, when formulating constitutive models, consideration of the shear – tension coupling can result in improved accuracy in subsequent predictions of the forming process. In order to include this behaviour, an existing non-orthogonal constitutive model [4 - 5] has been enhanced.

40|$|Modelling {{the forming}} process for {{engineering}} fabrics and textile composites using a mechanical approach, {{such as the}} finite element method, requires characterisation of the material’s behaviour under large shear deformation.

This paper focuses on a novel testing technique, the biaxial bias extension test, {{as a means to}} investigate this shear–tension coupling and fabric wrinkling. Novel methods of determining the wrinkling behaviour are demonstrated. The main difficulty with the technique lies in extracting the material contribution to the recorded signal.

A MatlabTM code 'InitialAngle. m' has been written to produce two input files; the first 'Mat. inp' includes the material property parameters of each element and the second 'Sec. inp' includes the sections of those elements.

To provide epoxy based {{composites}} with self-healing ability, two-component healing system {{consisting of}} urea-formaldehyde walled microcapsules containing epoxy (30 ~ 70 µm in diameter) and CuBr 2 (2 -MeIm) 4 (the complex of CuBr 2 and 2 -methylimidazole) latent hardener was synthesized.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{further development of}} a novel Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) approach described {{in one of our}} previous papers. Here these sensors have been used {{for the first time as}} a Piecewise Continuous System (PCS), which means that they are not only capable of following the deformation pattern but can also detect distinctive fracture events. In order to characterize the simultaneous compression and traction response of these sensors, multilayer glass laminate composite samples were prepared for 3 -point bending tests. The laminate sample consisted of five layers of plain <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fabrics</b> placed one over another. The sensors were placed at two strategic locations during the lay-up process so as to follow traction and compression separately. The reinforcements were then impregnated in epoxy resin and later subjected to 3 -point bending tests.

The results obtained, under standard testing conditions have shown that our textile fibrous sensors can not only be used for simultaneous detection of compression and traction in composite parts for on-line structural health monitoring but their sensitivity and carefully chosen location inside the composite ensures that each fracture event is indicated in real time by the output signal of the sensor...|$|R
