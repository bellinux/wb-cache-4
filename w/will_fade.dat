25|$|Modern {{water-based}} {{face and}} body paints are made according to stringent guidelines, meaning these are non-toxic, usually non-allergenic, and can easily be washed away. Temporary staining may develop after use, but it <b>will</b> <b>fade</b> after normal washing. These are either applied with hands, paint brush, and synthetic sponges or natural sea sponge, or alternatively with an airbrush.|$|E

25|$|When {{making a}} quilt it is {{important}} to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order {{to have some kind of}} guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a quilting ruler and rotary cutter.

25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Dr. Norval's return to New England from a {{geological}} expedition in the Southwest, {{accompanied by a}} ten-year-old girl, Lola, and trunks of supposed geological specimens. He was appointed her guardian {{when he and his}} companions, Mr. Lebrun and Mr. Sinclair, rescued her from Indian captivity. Because her skin was dyed black by her captors, her arrival generates commotion among the abolitionist women in the household, especially Mrs. Norval. She is disgusted at the idea of Dr. Norval contaminating the racial purity of their home, despite his insistence that Lola is of pure Spanish descent and the dye <b>will</b> <b>fade.</b> Mrs. Norval demands that Lola work in order to pay for expenses; Dr. Norval objects and explains to her, through a flashback, how he encountered Lola's mother, Doña Theresa Medina. She had given him gold and precious gems she acquired as a captive of the Apache to finance Lola's care. Doña Theresa Medina asked him to rescue Lola so that she would be brought up as a Catholic. The Puritan Yankee Mrs. Norval is angered when she hears this but quickly reconciles her emotions when he shows her the trunks filled with Lola's fortune.|$|E

500|$|The {{first version}} of The Picture of Dorian Gray was {{published}} as the lead story in the July 1890 edition of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, along with five others. The story begins with a man painting a picture of Gray. When Gray, who has a [...] "face like ivory and rose leaves", sees his finished portrait, he breaks down. Distraught that his beauty <b>will</b> <b>fade</b> while the portrait stays beautiful, he inadvertently makes a Faustian bargain in which only the painted image grows old while he stays beautiful and young. For Wilde, the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were its object. As Gray's portrait allows him to escape the corporeal ravages of his hedonism, Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty he saw in art with daily life.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, {{also known as}} The Place of No Stars. The spirits of cats who cause great pain and suffering to others during their lives reside there {{in order to pay}} for their sins. As the name suggests, it {{takes the form of a}} never-ending forest, forcing its residents to forever walk alone. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they later learn how to walk in the dreams of living cats. [...] Like StarClan cats, Dark Forest residents <b>will</b> <b>fade</b> away if they are forgotten, or killed in battle. A unique aspect is that if a living cat dies whilst visiting the Dark Forest in their dreams, they will automatically become a spirit of the Dark Forest themselves. In addition, it is possible for StarClan cats to become lost within the forest if they stay there for too long, hence why the majority avoid it.|$|E
500|$|StarClan is a {{group of}} the Clans' {{deceased}} ancestors who give guidance to the Clans. After death, most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt, and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior. Upon joining StarClan, the cats' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living (i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured).StarClan Warriors, elders, deputies, queens, and kits keep watch over the Clans, usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive. They provide guidance to the Clans, often through dreams and other signs like omens. Often, this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone, a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine, which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine and leader cats' ancestors every half-moon. This is later replaced by the Moonpool, a small body of water from which cats can drink from in order to communicate with StarClan. In an author chat, Hunter said that StarClan can [...] "just get glimpses of" [...] the future, which they occasionally pass on, although these visions tend to be convoluted and difficult to understand. StarClan cats are often described as being transparent and silver in color, with stars sparkling around their paws. In the manga, their eyes are portrayed as blank and empty. On very rare occasions, a StarClan cat will interact with the world of the living, mainly to take a recently deceased cat to their place of resting. When a StarClan cat is forgotten by all living memory, or is killed in battle, they <b>will</b> <b>fade</b> away-it is unknown what happens to them after this.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long before}} his death, Leskov {{reportedly}} said: [...] "Now they read me {{just for the}} intricacies of my stories, but in fifty years' time {{the beauty of it}} all <b>will</b> <b>fade</b> and only the ideas my books contain will retain value." [...] That, according to Mirsky, was an exceptionally ill-judged forecast. [...] "Now more than ever Leskov is being read and praised for his inimitable form, style and manner of speech," [...] the critic wrote in 1926. Many critics and colleagues of Leskov wrote about his innovative style and experiments in form. Anton Chekhov called him and Turgenev his two [...] "tutors in literature." ...|$|E
50|$|Light fading {{occurs when}} {{materials}} {{are exposed to}} light, e.g. while on display. The intensity of the light source and ultraviolet (UV) rays will affect {{the rate of change}} and <b>fade.</b> Magenta dyes <b>will</b> typically <b>fade</b> the quickest.|$|R

5000|$|Some condoms {{designed}} to prevent premature ejaculation. Benzocaine largely inhibits sensitivity on the penis, and can allow for an erection to be maintained longer (in a continuous act) by delaying ejaculation.

2500|$|Some {{military}} compasses, {{like the}} U.S. M-1950 (Cammenga 3H) military lensatic compass, the Silva 4b Militaire, and the Suunto M-5N(T) contain the radioactive material tritium (1H3) and {{a combination of}} phosphors. [...] The U.S. M-1950 equipped with self-luminous lighting contains 120 mCi (millicuries) of tritium. The purpose of the tritium and phosphors is to provide illumination for the compass, via radioluminescent tritium illumination, which {{does not require the}} compass to be [...] "recharged" [...] by sunlight or artificial light. However, tritium has a half-life of only about 12 years, so a compass that contains 120mCi of tritium when new will contain only 60 when it is 12 years old, 30 when it is 24 years old, and so on. Consequently, the illumination of the display <b>will</b> <b>fade.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Wilde has {{provided}} inspiration for other artists, including Charlotte Hatherley, {{who wrote a}} song about her entitled [...] "Kim Wilde", and included it on her debut album, Grey <b>Will</b> <b>Fade.</b> East German punk rock band Feeling B also recorded a song called [...] "Kim Wilde", which featured on their debut album. In 1985, French singer Laurent Voulzy paid tribute to Wilde in his song [...] "Les Nuits Sans Kim Wilde" [...] ("Nights Without Kim Wilde"). In her graphic novel Persepolis, Iranian cartoonist Marjane Satrapi has a comic strip titled Kim Wilde. In it the main character Marji, a young Iranian girl, sings [...] "Kids in America" [...] {{in the streets of}} the Iranian capital. Also, when her parents go on holiday in Turkey, they buy a poster of Kim Wilde and smuggle it into Tehran for Marji. Marji pins the poster on her bedroom's wall and practises emulating Wilde.|$|E

2500|$|Rathbone {{was also}} one to dismiss the {{complaints}} {{in an interview with}} MTV, saying, [...] "I think it's {{one of those things where}} I pull my hair up, shave the sides, and I definitely need a tan. It's one of those things where, hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that <b>will</b> <b>fade</b> away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
2500|$|Gears of War is a third-person shooter {{that places}} {{emphasis}} on using cover to avoid taking damage while moving towards enemy forces. The game uses {{a number of}} weapon archetypes, but predominately featured is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can deal melee damage at close range. Playable characters can carry two primary weapons, grenades, and a smaller, secondary weapon such as the Snub Pistol. Weapons are reloaded with a tap of the RB button, and a second tap within a given time (active reload) rewards the player with a damage bonus. However, failing to perform the [...] "Active Reload" [...] correctly will cause the gun to become momentarily jammed while the player's character fixes it.
