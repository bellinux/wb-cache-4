5|$|In 2016, HarperCollins Publishers {{announced}} {{the release of}} a previously unknown novel by Michael Crichton, Dragon Teeth, the manuscript for which <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> his widow.

5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 47 Ursae Majoris c <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> detecting changes in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. This was done by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum.|$|E

5|$|The first epizoic {{species of}} earwig <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> a London {{taxidermist}} {{on the body}} of a Malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909, then described by Karl Jordan. By the 1950s, the two suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina had been added to Dermaptera.|$|E
5|$|The powerfully {{rising and}} sinking air in {{mountain}} waves <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary oxygen to avoid hypoxia.|$|E

5|$|Triton <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> William Lassell in 1846, just {{seventeen}} {{days after}} the discovery of Neptune. Nereid <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> Gerard P. Kuiper in 1949. The third moon, later named Larissa, was first observed by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen on May 24, 1981. The astronomers were observing a star's close approach to Neptune, looking for rings similar to those discovered around Uranus four years earlier. If rings were present, the star's luminosity would decrease slightly just before the planet's closest approach. The star's luminosity dipped only for several seconds, which meant that {{it was due to}} a moon rather than a ring.|$|E
5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} optical equipment, {{it is still possible}} for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|For decades, the {{commercial}} technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, {{a process that}} <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.|$|E

5|$|HD 28185 b <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> {{detecting}} small periodic {{variations in}} the radial velocity of its parent star caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet. This was achieved by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. In 2001 {{it was announced that}} HD 28185 exhibited a wobble along the line-of-sight with a period of 383 days, with an amplitude indicating a minimum mass 5.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> accident as {{a result}} of mistakes committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and photographic plates were insensitive, necessitating long exposures during which vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant holograms, which showed the holographic subject covered with fringes, were considered ruined.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm {{resembled the}} Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see}} the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a bug <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> İnci Sözlük {{that could}} allow a Twitter user to force others {{to follow them}} without the other users' consent or knowledge.

5|$|In early 1799 Prudente was {{operating}} off South Africa, attacking British trade passing {{to or from}} the Cape Colony when the ship <b>was</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>by</b> British frigate HMS Daedalus under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball. Prudente turned away and Ball gave chase, following the French ship closely. After five hours Daedalus caught Prudente and fired a raking broadside into the stern, disabling the French ship. For another hour the action continued at close range until Prudente was forced to surrender.|$|E
