25|$|Native Americans {{had become}} {{dependent}} on manufactured goods such as guns and domesticated animals, and lost much of their traditional practices. With the new cattle herds roaming the hunting lands, and {{a greater emphasis on}} farming due to the invention of the Cotton Gin, Native Americans struggled to maintain their place in the economy. An inequality gap had appeared in the tribes, as some hunters were more successful than others. Still, the creditors treated and individual’s debt as debt of the whole tribe, and used several strategies to keep the Native Americans in debt. Traders would rig the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> that determined the value of the deerskins in their favor, cut measurement tools to devalue the deerskin, and would tamper with the manufactured goods to decrease their worth, such as watering down the alcohol they traded. To satisfy the need for deerskins, many males of the tribes abandoned their traditional seasonal roles and became full-time traders. When the deerskin trade collapsed, Native Americans found themselves dependent on manufactured goods, and could not return to the old ways due to lost knowledge.|$|E
60|$|The {{skill of}} an uneducated {{person in the}} use of weapons, or of tools, is of a {{precisely}} similar nature. The savage who executes unerringly the exact throw which brings down his game, or his enemy, in the manner most suited to his purpose, under the operation of all the conditions necessarily involved, the weight and form of the weapon, the direction and distance of the object, the action of the wind, etc., owes this power to a long series of previous experiments, the results of which he certainly never framed into any verbal theorems or rules. The same thing may generally be said of any other extraordinary manual dexterity. Not long ago a Scotch manufacturer procured from England, at a high rate of wages, a working dyer, famous for producing very fine colors, with the view of teaching to his other workmen the same skill. The workman came; but his mode of proportioning the ingredients, in which lay the secret of the effects he produced, was by taking them up in handfuls, while the common method was to weigh them. The manufacturer sought to make him turn his handling system into an equivalent <b>weighing</b> <b>system,</b> that the general principle of his peculiar mode of proceeding might be ascertained. This, however, the man found himself quite unable to do, and therefore could impart his skill to nobody. He had, from the individual cases of his own experience, established a connection in his mind between fine effects of color, and tactual perceptions in handling his dyeing materials; and from these perceptions he could, in any particular case, infer the means to be employed, and the effects which would be produced, but could not put others in possession of the grounds on which he proceeded, from having never generalized them in his own mind, or expressed them in language.|$|E

50|$|There are {{different}} types of cement silos such as the low-level mobile silo and the static upright cement silo, which are used to hold and discharge cement and other powder materials such as PFA (Pulverised Fuel Ash). The low-level silos are fully mobile with capacities from 100 to 750 tons. They are simple to transport and are easy to set up on site. These mobile silos generally come equipped with an electronic <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> with digital display and printer. This allows any quantity of cement or powder discharged from the silo to be controlled and also provides an accurate indication of what remains inside the silo. The static upright silos have capacities from 200 to 800 tons. These are considered a low-maintenance option for the storage of cement or other powders. Cement silos {{can be used in}} conjunction with bin-fed batching plants.|$|E

5000|$|The {{testing machine}} is 47 ft long and weighs some [...] It works horizontally, the load applied by a {{hydraulic}} cylinder and ram. The working fluid is water not oil. The load {{is measured by}} a <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> consisting {{of a number of}} levers with the final one carrying a jockey weight. The operator lets water into the hydraulic cylinder and as the pressure and hence load on the test piece increases the jockey weight is wound along to balance the hydraulic load. As it is wound it moves along a graduated scale and when the object under test fails the number on this scale is noted and multiplied by the weight to give the failure load. The weight can be varied in increments of 50 lb using slotted plates on a hanger. On the lower scale this reads up to 150 lb, and up to 1000 lb can be put onto the hanger. A separate jockey weight system above this one allowed the machine to measure loads of up to 1000000 lb.|$|E

5000|$|To {{start the}} bagging process, a {{horizontal}} sealing bar creates the [...] "Bottom Seal" [...] by clamping {{across the bottom}} edge of the tube, bonding the film together, and cutting off any film below. This sealing bar can be on a fixed height, which is called an intermittent sealing process. Faster systems include a sealing bar that moves down with the bag while sealing. This is called a continuous process. The product is either pre-measured by a multi-head <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> or the sealed tube end is then lowered onto a precision weighing table and the product to be bagged is dispensed through the long conical tube {{in the center of}} the bag. When the gross weight of the product-filled bag is reached, filling stops, and the horizontal sealing bar seals the top of the bag, simultaneously forming the bottom of the next bag above. This bag is then cut off from the tube and is now a sealed package, ready to advance onward into the product boxing and shipping processes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − This {{research}} {{deals with}} a <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> used under {{the conditions in which}} various movements exist. These various movements are heaving motion, rolling motion, pitching motion, etc. In this paper, these various movements are collectively called as “vibration-like movements”. The term of “vibration-like moving conditions” means the conditions in which vibration-like movements exist. In the previous paper[1], the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> which has 3 dummy loadcells is discussed. “Dummy loadcell ” is the loadcell which observes the vibration-like movements. We manufactured the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> and made several experiments with the <b>weighing</b> <b>system.</b> As a result of those experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed method is able to weigh under the vibration-like moving conditions accurately. The purpose of this research is the practical realization of the <b>weighing</b> <b>system.</b> In order to put the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> into practical use, it is needed to reduce the size and weight of the <b>weighing</b> <b>system.</b> Accelerometers are substituted for the dummy loadcells. Generally, accelerometers are lighter and smaller than loadcells. This research verifies the effectiveness of the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> with “dummy accelerometers”...|$|E
