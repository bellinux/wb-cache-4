5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} the Cairo project in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user interface features for a coming consumer version of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT.</b> Although {{the project was}} ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects. By 1994, Microsoft and NeXT were collaborating on a <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> port of OpenStep; the port, however, was never released.|$|E
5|$|Bob Muglia {{started his}} Microsoft career in 1988. He {{was the first}} product manager for SQL Server. Muglia also served as the {{director}} of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> Program Management and User Education. He was promoted to vice president of the <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> division in October 1995. Muglia later held the position of vice president of the Server Application group, until he was promoted to {{senior vice president of the}} Applications and Tools group in February 1998.|$|E
5|$|Version 2001 (2.5) was {{released}} September 18, 2000, adding support for Windows ME {{in addition to}} the Windows 9x series, <b>Windows</b> <b>NT,</b> and Windows 2000. Following attacks by the ILOVEYOU and Anna Kournikova script viruses, this version can block malicious scripts without virus signatures, but by analyzing behavior.|$|E
5000|$|Unified Registry {{editor that}} {{combines}} Windows 9x's Regedit.exe and <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> Regedt32.exe. The Registry Editor now supports multiple instances if the -m switch is specified.|$|R
25|$|The {{architecture}} of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> kernel {{is considered a}} hybrid kernel because the kernel itself contains tasks such as the Window Manager and the IPC Managers, with a client/server layered subsystem model.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the last}} version of DOS that IBM and Microsoft shared the full code for, and the DOS that was {{integrated}} into OS/2 2.0's, and later <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's,</b> virtual DOS machine.|$|R
5|$|The {{developers}} aim to {{make the}} kernel and usermode APIs more compatible with <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> version 5.2 (Windows Server 2003) and to add support for more applications and hardware with plans to target newer versions of Windows as development matures. DirectX support is undertaken through ReactX, an in-house implementation. 2D hardware-accelerated rendering is done natively, while other drawing functionality is redirected to OpenGL as a stopgap solution.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} the hardware business, NeXT returned to selling a toolkit {{to run on}} other operating systems, in effect returning to the original business plan. New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's <b>Windows</b> <b>NT.</b> The company also launched WebObjects, a platform for building large-scale dynamic web applications. Many large businesses including Dell, Disney, WorldCom, and the BBC used this WebObjects software for a short time. Today, WebObjects is used almost solely to power Apple's iTunes Store {{and most of its}} corporate Web site.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft, in 2000, {{released}} {{new products}} {{for all three}} lines of the company's flagship operating system, and saw {{the beginning of the}} end of one of its most prominent legal cases. On February 17, Microsoft released an update to its business line of software in Windows 2000. It provided a high level of stability similar to that of its Unix counterparts due to its usage of the <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> kernel, and matching features found in the consumer line of the Windows operating system including a DOS emulator that could run many legacy DOS applications.|$|E
5000|$|The (A)LPC {{interface}} {{is part of}} <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> undocumented Native API, and as such is {{not available}} to applications for direct use. However, {{it can be used}} indirectly in the following instances: ...|$|R
50|$|Microsoft's <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> native file system, NTFS, {{supported}} long file {{names and}} did not divide the file name into a name and an extension, but again, the convention of using suffixes to simulate extensions continued, for compatibility with existing versions of Windows.|$|R
5000|$|Driver Support for <b>Windows</b> 95/98/ME, <b>NT</b> 4.0, <b>Windows</b> 2000/XP.|$|R
5|$|Most {{versions}} of Windows Mobile have a standard set of features, such as multitasking {{and the ability}} to navigate a file system similar to that of Windows 9x and <b>Windows</b> <b>NT,</b> including support for many of the same file types. Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks. Internet Explorer Mobile is the default web browser, and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of Microsoft Office, is the default office suite.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Previously {{the police}} used a {{decentralized}} {{information technology system}} developed during the mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes. The new IT-system D#2 was introduced in 2011 and will have been taken into use by all divisions by 2012. D#2 will be operated by ErgoGroup and will have two redundant server centers. Personnel {{have access to the}} system via thin clients. The police have a system to raise a national alarm to close border crossings and call in reserve personnel. The one time it was activated the message was not received by any of the intended recipients. Since 2009 it has been possible to report criminal damage and theft of wallets, bicycles and mobile telephones without a known perpetrator(s) online.|$|E
50|$|The {{release of}} Windows XP in October 2001 brought the NT kernel version of Windows to general users, {{replacing}} Windows 9x with {{a completely different}} operating system. The architecture of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> kernel is considered a hybrid kernel because the kernel itself contains tasks such as the Window Manager and the IPC Managers, with a client/server layered subsystem model.|$|R
50|$|Named pipes {{is also a}} {{networking}} protocol in the Server Message Block (SMB) suite, {{based on}} the use of a special inter-process communication (IPC) share. SMB's IPC can seamlessly and transparently pass the authentication context of the user across to Named Pipes. <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> entire NT Domain protocol suite of services are implemented as DCE/RPC service over Named Pipes, as are the Exchange 5.5 Administrative applications.|$|R
5000|$|Driver Support for <b>Windows</b> 95/98/ME, <b>NT</b> 4.0, <b>Windows</b> 2000/XP, OS/2, Netware, ODI, SCO Unix, Netware & Linux.|$|R
25|$|Windows Embedded Compact {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with Windows XP Embedded or <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 Embedded, modular editions of Windows based on <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> kernel.|$|E
25|$|The first {{release of}} the {{resulting}} operating system, <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 3.1 (named to associate it with Windows 3.1) was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop workstations and servers. <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 3.5 was released in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for Novell's NetWare, and was followed up by <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 3.51 in May 1995, which included additional improvements {{and support for the}} PowerPC architecture. <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of Windows 95 to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000, a successor to NT 4.0. The <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> name was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the Windows brand.|$|E
25|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> {{included}} {{support for}} several different platforms before the x86-based personal computer became {{dominant in the}} professional world. <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000. (Although some these platforms implement 64-bit computing, the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as IA-32) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> family still runs on IA-32, although the Windows Server line has ceased supporting this platform {{with the release of}} Windows Server 2008 R2.|$|E

25|$|File {{systems have}} been {{developed}} by companies to meet their specific needs, by hobbyists, or adapted from Unix, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems. Linux has full support for XFS and JFS, FAT (the DOS file system), and HFS, the main file system for the Macintosh. Support for Microsoft <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> NTFS file system has been developed and is now comparable with other native Unix file systems. CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs' ISO 9660 and Universal Disk Format (UDF) are supported.|$|R
50|$|Most {{operating}} systems will display an idle task, {{which is a}} special task loaded by the OS scheduler only when there is nothing for the computer to do. The idle task can be hard-coded into the scheduler, {{or it can be}} implemented as a separate task with the lowest possible priority. An advantage of the latter approach is that programs monitoring the system status can see the idle task along with all other tasks; an example is <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> System Idle Process.|$|R
25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} {{an overhaul}} of the previous <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> operating system loader architecture NTLDR. Used by versions of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> since its inception with <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 3.1, NTLDR has been completely replaced with a new architecture designed to address modern firmware technologies such as the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. The new architecture introduces a firmware-independent data store and is backward compatible with previous versions of the Windows operating system.|$|E
25|$|In Microsoft Windows, the Start menu in {{some form}} appears in Windows 9x, <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 and all {{subsequent}} versions in the <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> family, as well as Windows CE, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.|$|E
25|$|IIS 2.0 was {{included}} with <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0.|$|E
50|$|In NTFS, all file, {{directory}} and metafile data—file name, creation date, {{access permissions}} (by {{the use of}} access control lists), and size—are stored as metadata in the Master File Table (MFT). This abstract approach allowed easy addition of file system features during <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> development—an example is the addition of fields for indexing used by the Active Directory software. This also enables fast file search software such as Everything to locate named local files and folders included in the MFT very quickly, without requiring any other index.|$|R
50|$|VDMSound {{started as}} a private project in 1998, in Montreal, its {{motivating}} purpose being that of capturing in-game MIDI music through software while taking advantage of <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> 16-bit subsystem virtualization. It became open-source and moved to SourceForge after a full rewrite {{in the early spring}} of 2001. It was discontinued in early 2004 (last checkin occurred on 2004-02-14), when additional improvements in emulation were no longer possible due to limitations in the Windows 16-bit subsystem. The sound emulation code from VDMSound has since been integrated into DOSBox.|$|R
5000|$|In DOS's COMMAND.COM and in <b>Windows</b> <b>NT's</b> cmd.exe {{users can}} modify the prompt by issuing a [...] command or by {{directly}} changing {{the value of}} the corresponding [...] environment variable. The default of most modern systems, the [...] style is obtained, for instance, with [...] The default of older DOS systems, [...] is obtained by just , although on some systems this produces the newer [...] style, unless used on floppy drives A: or B:; on those systems [...] can be used to override the automatic default and explicitly switch to the older style.|$|R
25|$|One of Microsoft's biggest {{advances}} initially {{developed for}} <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> {{was a new}} 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 16-bit Windows API. This API was called Win32, {{and from then on}} Microsoft referred to the older 16-bit API as Win16. The Win32 API had three levels implementations: the complete one for <b>Windows</b> <b>NT,</b> a subset for Chicago (originally called Win32c) missing features primarily of interest to enterprise customers (at the time) such as security and Unicode support, and a more limited subset called Win32s which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems. Thus Microsoft sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and <b>Windows</b> <b>NT,</b> even though the two systems had radically different internal architectures. <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel.|$|E
25|$|The Graphics Device Interface is {{responsible}} for tasks such as drawing lines and curves, rendering fonts and handling palettes. The <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 3.x series of releases had placed the GDI component in the user-mode Client/Server Runtime Subsystem, but this was moved into kernel mode with <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 to improve graphics performance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 was the {{successor}} of 3.51 (1995) and 3.5 (1994). Microsoft released <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> 4.0 to manufacturing in July 1996, {{one year after}} the release of Windows 95. Major new features included the new Explorer shell from Windows 95, scalability and feature improvements to the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC.|$|E
