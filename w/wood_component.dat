One main challenge of biobased building materials is their inherent moisture sensitivity, a major cause for fungal decay, mold growth and dimensional instability, resulting in decreased service life as well as costly maintenance. A new building material known as wood-plastic composites (WPCs) has emerged. WPCs are a combination of a thermoplastic matrix and a <b>wood</b> <b>component,</b> the former is usually recycled polyethylene or polypropylene, and the latter a wood processing residual, e. g. sawdust and wood shavings. The objective of this thesis was to gain more insight about characteristics of WPCs containing a modified <b>wood</b> <b>component.</b> The hypothesis was that a modified <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> in WPCs would increase the moisture resistance and durability in outdoor applications. The study comprises both injection molded and extruded WPC samples made with an unmodified, acetylated, thermally modified or furfurylated <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> in a polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cellulose ester (CAP, a cellulose ester containing both acetate and propionate substituents) or polylactate (PLA) matrix. The WPCs were prepared with 50 - 70 weight-% wood. The emphasis was on studying the moisture sorption, fungal resistance and micromorphological features of these new types of composites. Water sorption in both liquid and vapor phases was studied, and the biological performance was studied both in laboratory and in long term outdoor field tests. Micromorphological features were assessed by analyzing of the <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> prior to and after processing, and by studying the composite microstructure by means of a new sample preparation technique based on UV excimer laser ablation combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the WPCs with a modified <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> had a distinctly lower hygroscopicity than the WPCs with unmodified wood, which resulted in less wood-plastic interfacial cracks when subjected to a moisture soaking-drying cycle. Durability assessments in field and marine tests showed that WPCs with PP or CAP as a matrix and 70 weight-% unmodified wood degraded severely within a few years, whereas the corresponding WPCs with a modified <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> were sound after 7 years in field tests and 6 years in marine tests. Accelerated durability tests of WPCs with PLA as a matrix showed only low mass losses due to decay. However, strength losses due to moisture sorption suggest that the compatibility between the PLA and the different wood components must be improved. The micromorphological studies showed that WPC processing distinctly reduces the size and changes the shape of the <b>wood</b> <b>component.</b> The change was most pronounced in the thermally modified <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> which became significantly reduced in size. The disintegration of the modified wood components during processing also creates a more homogeneous micromorphology of the WPCs, which may be beneficial from a mechanical performance perspective. Future studies are suggested to include analyses of the surface composition, the surface energy and the surface energy heterogeneity of both wood and polymer components in order to tailor new compatible wood-polymer combinations in WPCs and biocomposites.

One route to achieving WPC products with increased biological durability is to use wood preservative agents {{in the formulation of}} the WPC. Another option could be to use a chemically modified <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> that already exhibits increased resistance to biological degradation. There is also a need to use biobased thermoplastics made from renewable resources, which would decrease the dependency on petrochemically-produced thermoplastics in the future.

40|$|Because {{of the low}} {{polarity}} of the polymers {{used for}} manufacturing wood plastic composites (WPCs), they have low surface energy and their adhesion properties are limited. In this study, the surface modification with atmospheric pressure rotating plasma jet (APPT) of several WPCs made with different polymers is proposed as an environmentally friendly alternative for increasing their hydrophilicity and adhesion. Both the nozzle-WPC surface distance and the platform speed were varied during APPT treatment and only one pass was carried out. APPT treatment of the WPCs made with polyethylene and polypropylene removed most of the <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> and exposed the polymer to the surface, changing their chemistry, surface energy and topography. An improvement in adhesion of the WPCs to different coatings was obtained which was ascribed {{to the creation of}} new polar carbon-oxygen moieties, and the removal of <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> on the WPC surfaces. The less surface modification caused by APPT treatment of the WPC made with poly (vinyl chloride) was ascribed to its low wood content and the presence of inorganic fillers.

40|$|Today {{there is}} growing {{interest}} within the construction sector to increase the proportion of biobased building materials made from renewable resources. By-products or residuals from wood processing could in this case be valuable resources for manufacturing new types of biocomposites. An important research question related to wood-based biocomposites is how to characterise molecular interactions between the different components in the composite. The hygroscopic character of wood and its water sorption properties are also crucial. Thermal modification (or heat treatment) of wood results {{in a number of}} enhanced properties such as reduced hygroscopicity and improved dimensional stability as well as increased resistance to microbiological decay. In this thesis, surface characteristics of thermally modified <b>wood</b> <b>components</b> (often called <b>wood</b> fibres or particles) and influencing effects from moisture sorption have been analysed using a number of material characterisation techniques. The aim is to increase the understanding in how to design efficient material combinations for the use of such <b>wood</b> <b>components</b> in biocomposites. The specific objective was to study surface energy characteristics of thermally modified spruce (Picea abies Karst.) under influences of water vapour sorption. An effort was also made to establish a link between surface energy and surface chemical composition. The surface energy of both thermally modified and unmodified <b>wood</b> <b>components</b> were studied at different surface coverages using inverse gas chromatography (IGC), providing information about the heterogeneity of the surface energy. The water vapour sorption behaviour of the <b>wood</b> <b>components</b> was studied using the dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) method, and their surface chemical composition was studied by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, the morphology of the <b>wood</b> <b>components</b> was studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The IGC analysis indicated a more heterogeneous surface energy character of the thermally modified wood compared with the unmodified wood. An increase of the dispersive surface energy due to exposure to an increased relative humidity (RH) from 0 % to 75 % RH at 30  ˚C was also indicated for the modified samples. The DVS analysis indicated an increase in equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in adsorption due to the exposure to 75 % RH. Furthermore, the XPS results indicated a decrease of extractable and a relative increase of non-extractable compounds due to the exposure, valid for both the modified and the unmodified wood. The property changes due to the increased RH condition and also due to the thermal modification are suggested to be related to alterations in the amount of accessible hydroxyl groups in the wood surface. Recommendations for future work and implications of the results could be related to knowledge-based tailoring of new compatible and durable material combinations, for example when using thermally modified <b>wood</b> <b>components</b> in new types of biocomposites for outdoor applications.

40|$|Conventional wood plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) {{in general}} combine wood residuals with thermoplastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The basic idea {{in this work}} is to replace these olefin plastic matrixes in WPCs with a so-called biobased plastic, namely poly(lactic acid) (PLA). To reduce the water sensitivity of such biocomposites, for typical outdoor use, the idea is also to incorporate a modified <b>wood</b> <b>component.</b> The aim of this work was to study the microstructure of injection moulded WPCs based on PLA and modified wood, and to investigate some of their micromechanical behaviour. Four different PLA/wood formulations (weight-% ratio 50 / 50) were studied: PLA combined with 1) unmodified MDF fibres, 2) acetylated MDF fibers: 3) acetylated wood particles: and 4) thermally modified wood particles. The processing effects on the form {{and shape of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> were studied by a matrix extraction procedure combined with light microscopy. The microstructure of the WPCs were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a sample preparation technique based on UV laser ablation, i. e. a surface preparation procedure allowing microscopic observations without microtoming. Microtensile testing was performed on samples prepared from the core and skin layers of the WPC samples. It was observed that the processing of the WPCs resulted in severe damage and fragmentation of the wood fibres and particles. Especially, the processing with a thermally modified <b>wood</b> <b>component</b> yielded a lot of wood cell wall fragments/fines. Good dispersion of the wood reinforcements in the PLA matrix was observed in all cases, even though the distribution and orientation of the fibres varied between different regions in the samples. No principal fibre orientation was outlined in the core, while closer to the surface regions the fibres tend to orient in the flow direction. Supposedly a turbulence effect {{at the end of the}} moulded samples also induced disorientation of the fibres. Long and slender shape, i. e. a higher aspect ratio, of the wood components were as expected found to be more efficient as a reinforcement than particulate shaped ones. The composites with acetylated MDF fibers were also observed to be weaker than composites with unmodified ones. On the other hand, SEM observations of fracture surfaces exhibited better reinforcement-matrix interaction for the modified wood than for the unmodified wood. Although the fracture surfaces observations outlined the importance of fibre orientation, with a more brittle type of failure in the core and fibre breakage or debonding closer to the surface, there was no significant difference found between mechanical properties for the core and skin layer specimens. Other factors have therefore to be investigated in order to explain the rather uniform strength measurements within different regions in the composites. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
