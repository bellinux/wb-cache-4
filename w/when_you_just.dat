Andrew Rennie of Now Magazine called a [...] "cautionary anthem" [...] {{and the song}} the top track on the album. Rennie also said that [...] "Successful" [...] and [...] "Black Roses", showcase Songz's developed, more mature side. Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice said, [...] "The calm, yearning song is a bona fide hit, and also {{the best example of}} where r lives today." [...] DJBooth said that there was [...] "no reason to doubt that this track will become a mainstream smash." [...] Shaheem Reid of MTV News said, [...] "It's not a record that will kill the clubs, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> want to listen to superb lyricism and enthralling harmony, it's a must have." [...] Rolling Stone ranked the song seventeen on their list of [...] "Best 25 Songs of 2009" [...] list, and Spin ranked it the tenth best song of 2009 on their [...] "The 20 Best Songs of 2009" [...] list.|$|E

The {{production}} was handled by Timberlake, Beyoncé, Dean, Jordy [...] "Boots" [...] Asher as well as Mosley, Harmon and Wane under their stage names Timbaland, J-Roc and Key Wane respectively. [...] "Partition" [...] was conceived as a two-part song, {{the first part of}} which is called [...] "Yoncé". The latter's original drumbeat was created by Timberlake on a bucket. Mike Dean then added the dropping 808's lead synths, claps and strings. Beyoncé described the sound that he created as [...] "organic" [...] and said, [...] "It reminded me of being in middle school during the lunch breaks, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> start free-styling." [...] The trio decided to keep the buckets as Beyoncé wanted an organic production. Then The-Dream started writing some of the lyrics including, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor". Beyoncé found it awkward at the beginning but she soon loved the phrase, which lead to the birth of her new alter ego, Yoncé. The singer revealed that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] after she recorded [...] "Partition" [...] because of its overtly sexual lyrics. Speaking about how {{the other part of the}} song materialized, Beyoncé said: ...|$|E

500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona told No Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ... Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> take animals and do nothing else, perhaps that is not as strong a message." ...|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

2500|$|The {{record was}} {{originally}} announced to be titled Heidi Montag, later Independent, and eventually The One. In 2009, Montag {{stated that the}} record would be titled Superficial, commenting that [...] "that's the world [...] in and how people think [...] but it's really just the surface". Its intended cover was shot by Liz Ciganovich, who commented that it was inspired by Montag's earlier music video for her song [...] "Overdosin'" [...] and [...] "Physical" [...] by Olivia Newton-John. It depicted Montag dressed in a strapless, polka-dotted leotard {{in front of a}} wall of cassettes, which she described as a [...] "shout out to the '80s" [...] and [...] "makes you remember <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> had to run out to the record store and get your favorite album".

6000|$|The letter {{had taken}} her long to write, and it took her uncle long to read, before {{he came to the}} end of it. He did not get through a line without sundry interruptions, which all arose from his {{determination}} to contradict at once every assertion which she made. 'You cannot prevent his coming,' he said, 'and it shall not be prevented.' 'Of course, you have promised to be his wife, and it must be.' 'Nonsense about deceiving him. He is not deceived at all.' 'Trash--you are not fond of another man. It is all nonsense.' 'You must do what your uncle wishes. You must, now! you must! Of course, you will love him. Why can't you let all that come as it does with others?' 'Letter gone;--yes indeed, and now I must go after it.' 'Trouble!--yes! Why could you not tell me before you sent it? Have I not always been good to you?' 'You have not been bad; not before. You have been very good. It is this that is bad.' 'Forget you indeed. Of course he won't. How should he? Are you not betrothed to him? He'll forgive you fast enough, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> say that you did not know what you were about when you were writing it.' Thus her uncle went on; and as the outburst of his wrath was, as it were, chopped into little bits by his having to continue the reading of the letter, the storm did not fall upon Marie's head so violently as she had expected.

60|$|When, {{their long}} journey over, they were {{settled in the}} little Scots town with its granite houses Lawson {{realised}} how much it meant to him to live once more among his own people. He looked back on the three years he had spent in Apia as exile, {{and returned to the}} life that seemed the only normal one with a sigh of relief. It was good to play golf once more, and to fish--to fish properly, that was poor fun in the Pacific <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> threw in your line and pulled out one big sluggish fish after another from the crowded sea--and it was good to see a paper every day with that day's news, and to meet men and women of your own sort, people you could talk to; and it was good to eat meat that was not frozen and to drink milk that was not canned. They were thrown upon their own resources much more than in the Pacific, and he was glad to have Ethel exclusively to himself. After two years of marriage he loved her more devotedly than ever, he could hardly bear her out of his sight, and the need in him grew urgent for a more intimate communion between them. But it was strange that after the first excitement of arrival she seemed to take less interest in the new life than he had expected. She did not accustom herself to her surroundings. She was a little lethargic. As the fine autumn darkened into winter she complained of the cold. She lay half the morning in bed {{and the rest of the}} day on a sofa, reading novels sometimes, but more often doing nothing. She looked pinched.|$|E
6000|$|These {{facts were}} as nothing, however, in {{presence}} of his quick and strong impression that his pale, nervous, smiling, clean-shaven host had undergone since their last meeting some extraordinary process of refinement. He had been ill, unmistakably, {{and the effects}} of a plunge into plain clean living, where any fineness had remained, were often startling, sometimes almost charming. But independently of this, and for a much longer time, some principle of intelligence, some art of life, would discernibly have worked in him. Remembered from college years and from those two or three luckless and faithless ones of the Law School as constitutionally common, as consistently and thereby doubtless even rather powerfully coarse, clever only for uncouth and questionable things, he yet presented himself now as if he had suddenly and mysteriously been educated. There was a charm in his wide, [...] "drawn," [...] convalescent smile, in the way his fine fingers--had he anything like fine fingers of old?--played, and just fidgeted, over the prompt and perhaps a trifle incoherent offer of cigars, cordials, ashtrays, over the question of his visitor's hat, stick, fur coat, general best accommodation and ease; and how the deuce, accordingly, had charm, for coming out so on top, Mark wondered, [...] "squared" [...] the other old elements? For the short interval so to have dealt with him what force had it turned on, what patented process, of the portentous New York order in which there were so many, had it skilfully applied? Were these the things New York did <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> gave her all her head, and that he himself then had perhaps too complacently missed? Strange {{almost to the point of}} putting him positively off at first--quite as an exhibition of the uncanny--this sense of Newton's having all the while neither missed nor muffed anything, and having, as with an eye to the coup de théâtre to come, lowered one's expectations, at the start, to that abject pitch. It might have been taken verily for an act of bad faith--really for such a rare stroke of subtlety as could scarce have been achieved by a straight or natural aim.|$|E
