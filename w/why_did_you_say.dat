I could never forget your love--your disinterested love--there is no treasure on this side the grave which I so value. It is the pride of my solitary hours, and the happiness of the few happy thoughts I have. The world would be nothing to me without you. When you are away, I pray to God to bring you back to me. When you are with us I am dreading the moment that you will go. Oh, Agatha, Agatha! <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> those last fearful words!" ...|$|E
