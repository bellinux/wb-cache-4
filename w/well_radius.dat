40|$|The motive of {{the study}} is to propose a water-gas {{two-phase}} flow model to depict the characteristics of Coalbed Methane (CBM) transporting in the unsaturated coalbed and predict the production of CBM well. The proposed model is established based on Buckley-Leverett equation. The calculating equations of daily gas and water production of CBM well are derived from the proposed model. A program is achieved based on the equations and an actual CBM well is simulated as an example. The simulated results are verified by the actual site monitoring values. Moreover, the effects of permeability, porosity, <b>well</b> control <b>radius,</b> coalbed thickness and coal-rock matrix radius on the daily gas production and cumulative gas production of CBM well are studied. The comprehensive results address that the equations of daily gas production and cumulative gas production are good agreement with the monitoring values.

Appropriate increase of the <b>well</b> control <b>radius</b> can improve the initial and stable daily gas production.

40|$|Flow {{problems}} in an anisotropic domain {{can be transformed}} into ones in an equivalent isotropic domain by coordinate transformations. Once analytical solutions are obtained for the equivalent isotropic domain, they can be back transformed to the original anisotropic domain. The existing solutions presented by Cihan et al. (2011) for isotropic multilayered aquifer systems with alternating aquitards and multiple injection/pumping wells and leaky wells were modified to account for horizontal anisotropy in aquifers. The modified solutions for pressure buildup distribution and leakage rates through leaky wells can be used when the anisotropy direction and ratio (Kx=Ky) {{are assumed to be}} identical for all aquifers alternating with aquitards. However, for multilayered aquifers alternating with aquicludes, both the principal direction of the anisotropic horizontal conductivity and the anisotropy ratio can be different in each aquifer. With coordinate transformation, a circular well with finite radius becomes an ellipse, and thus in the transformed domain the head contours in the immediate vicinity of the well have elliptical shapes. Through a radial flow approximation around the finite radius wells, the elliptical well boundaries in the transformed domain are approximated by an effective <b>well</b> <b>radius</b> expression. The analytical solutions with the effective radius approximations were compared with exact solutions as well as a numerical solution for elliptic flow. The effective <b>well</b> <b>radius</b> approximation is sufficiently accurate to predict the head buildup at the well bore of the injection/pumping wells for moderately anisotropic systems (Kx=Ky ≤ 25). The effective radius approximation gives satisfactory results for predicting head buildup at observation points and leakage through leaky wells away from the injection/pumping wells even for highly anisotropic aquifer systems (Kx=Ky ≤ 1000) ...|$|E

These simulators {{reproduce the}} measured flowing temperature and pressure profiles in flowing wells {{and determine the}} relative contribution, fluid properties (e. g. enthalpy, temperature) and fluid composition (e. g.

HOLA is a multi-feedzone geothermal wellbore simulator for pure water, modified after the wellbore simulator developed by Bjornsson, 1987 and can now handle deviated wells.

40|$|The {{solutions}} of constant-head and constant-flux {{tests are}} commonly used to predict the temporal or spatial drawdown distribution or to determine aquifer parameters. Theis and Thiem equations, for instance, are well-known transient and steady-state drawdown solutions, respectively, of the constant-flux test. It is known that the Theis equation is not applicable to the case where the aquifer has a finite boundary or the pumping time tends to infinity. On the other hand, the Thiem equation {{does not apply to}} the case where the aquifer boundary is infinite. However, the issue of obtaining the Thiem equation from the transient drawdown solution has not previously been addressed.

The analytical solution is obtained with a generalized Hankel transformation or with a Laplace transformation. The Hankel transformation {{turns out to be}} easier for G = 0, F ? 0, while the Laplace transformation is easier for F = 0, G ? 0. Both techniques can, however, deal with the full problem. The representation found by the generalized Hankel transform can also be found by the Laplace transform, through modification of the contour through the complex plane in the Bromwich integral for the inverse Laplace transform to the real axis. In practice, the numerical evaluation of the integral representation is difficult, due to the oscillating behavior of the integrands. A more appropriate numerical inversion procedure is also suggested, which circumvents the integration of the oscillating integrands, by an alternative modification of the contour in the Bromwich integral such that the new contour follows the steepest descent path starting from a saddle point at the real axis.

We evaluated the effects of horizontal <b>well</b> <b>radius,</b> length, and location on oil recovery through our testing. This work is necessary to provide field predictions {{for the use of}} foam and/or horizontal wells. A number of coreflood tests were performed to examine the effect of foam on oil recovery in heterogeneous porous media. Two coaxial composite cores were used to simulate layered formation systems.

Since injectivity loss is a problem in a number of gas injection projects, a preliminary investigation of injectivity loss in WAG was performed. A number of tests were carried out to investigate injectivity loss, indicating that for a given rock the injectivity loss depends on oil saturation in the core during WAG flooding. Higher loss was found in cores with high in-situ oil saturations. No injectivity loss was observed with the naturally fractured carbonate core...|$|E
30|$|An {{insight into}} the effect of aging time on the {{performance}} of LSW flooding can be precisely accomplished by a fine-grid 1 D reservoir simulation. As we have claimed by analyzing the results of field-scale simulations, the effect of aging time can be more pronounced in a core flooding or a small-scale simulation; hence, a small fine-grid 1 D model is employed here to nicely prove our assertion. This model contains 1000 grid blocks with the size of 0.15 ft in x-direction and 1 grid block with the size of 1 ft in y- and z-directions and totally has two wells (one production well and one injection well) located at the each end with the <b>well</b> <b>radius</b> of 0.05 ft in the 1 D model, where the production well operates at a constant bottom-hole pressure of 2700 psi and injection rate is kept constant at 0.1 bbl/day. It should be noted that other fluid/rock properties are same as model# 2 which is described earlier. Like the field-scale reservoir simulation, the injected brine salinity remains constant at 500  ppm and the aging times of 0, 4, and 10 days are considered to assess their effects. Although the simulation time during the field-scale model was 4500 days, equal to injection of 1.4 PV of water, this 1 D simulation only took 50 days, but we need {{to keep in mind that}} the total volume of injected water in PV unit is approximately same as the field-scale simulation. By this way, the aging time should be comparable with the water flooding duration.|$|E
40|$|A {{reservoir}} simulator {{solves the}} flow equations numerically on grids defining a reservoir region. However, when a well {{is located in}} a grid-block, the block pressure is not equal to the well pressure. In order to join the well to the grid blocks in which the well is located, it is usual to use a single phase model to obtain the appropriate Well Index. The Well Index is based on the concept of an effective <b>well</b> <b>radius</b> at which the pressure of the block applies. This approach requires the flow in the area around the well to be radial. Peaceman has proposed more general expressions for the effective radius, but all based on 2 D flow. As reservoirs are generally thin, a horizontal well cannot be far from the top or bottom boundary. In the case of multilateral wells, the situation is even worse, since the flow is perturbed not only by the boundaries but also by the other wells. Moreover, horizontal wells can be efficient in low permeability reservoirs, where the steady-state (or pseudo-steady-state) regime does not establish rapidly. This means that a single constant value for the well index cannot be used for all times. The objective of this study is then to evaluate well indices for different configurations of horizontal wells. The well index will be computed for a homogeneous anisotropic single-phase flow and will then be reintroduced in the simulator for the full three-phase study. The well index relates the pressure in the block to the pressure in the well for a given flow rate. If these two pressures are known, the well index can be deduced easily. The block pressure can be evaluated by a simulator. The well pressure for a three-dimensional single-phase flow is not known analytically in general, but can be computed by the semi-analytical method described briefly below...|$|E

40|$|Object-based {{stochastic}} modelling {{techniques are}} routinely employed to generate multiple realisations of the {{spatial distribution of}} sediment properties in settings where data density is insufficient to construct a unique deterministic facies architecture model. Challenge is to limit {{the wide range of}} possible outcomes of the stochastic model. Ideally, this is done by direct validation with the ‘real-world’ sediment distribution. In a reservoir setting this is impossible because of the limited data density in the wide-spaced wells. In this paper this uncertainty is overcome by using size, shape and facies distributions of tidal channel and tidal flat sand bodies in a highly data-constrained lithofacies architecture model as input for the object-based stochastic model. The lithofacies architecture model was constructed from a densely perforated (Cone Penetration Tests and cored boreholes) tidal estuarine succession of the Holocene Holland Tidal Basin in the Netherlands. The sensitivity of the stochastic model to the input parameters was analysed with the use of varying tidal channel width and thickness values and calculating the connected sand volume per well for the different scenarios.

40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} {{scale formation}} {{is a well}} known problem for water producing wells. Although there are several types of scale forming processes, we investigate the case of calcium carbonate precipitation when the degassing of CO 2 causes the calcium equilibrium concentration to decrease towards a production well. We study a simplified system of carbonate chemistry, which allows for analytical expressions for the porosity loss {{as a function of}} time. The precipitation process normally goes from flow-limited away from the well to precipitation-limited close to the well. We derive an expression that estimates the transition zone between these two regimes. Furthermore, we present analytical estimates for the porosity reduction at a given radius as a function of time, including an estimate for each of these precipitation regimes. These analytical results are tested against numerical solutions for the porosity loss, which account for the full set of equations of the model. The analytical models give an accurate estimate of the linear porosity reduction with time, until at least half the porosity is lost. Examples of scale formation are given for the two regimes. Reasonable values for the precipitation kinetics indicate that most production operations have a kinetics-limited regime close to the well. The models also show that this type of scale formation takes place very close to the wells, typically within a few <b>well</b> <b>radii</b> from the walls of the well...|$|R
