500|$|Madonna: Like an Icon was {{released}} on 27 August 2007, in the United Kingdom by Bantam Press. The book cover was designed by Holly MacDonald, with an image of Madonna from 2002, during the premiere of her film, Swept Away. It {{was released}} {{more than a year}} later in the United States. The biography faced mixed reviews from critics. Sarah Churchwell from The Guardian criticized O'Brien's extended commentary about Madonna's recording process. She believed that more emphasis should have been given on Madonna's personal life as well. Pointing out examples like Madonna's relationship with actor Warren Beatty, which was widely covered in the media but was only lightly touched in the book, Churchwell wondered about the claim of the book in its press release: [...] "This is the closest you will ever come to Madonna's autobiography". The reviewer concluded by saying, [...] "Since her voice is nowhere in evidence, this book, however capable and intelligent its writer, is probably about the farthest you <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> from Madonna's autobiography." ...|$|E

[...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews commented that the album [...] "proved remarkably consistent throughout, and was a superb listening experience" [...] and considered it a studio release, stating [...] "this was a short sharp shock of awesome lyricism, and many, unofficially, consider {{this to be the}} closest cousin we <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to Illmatic II." [...] Pitchfork Medias Ryan Dombal cited the album as one of Nas' [...] "finest moments". About.com's Henry Adaso called it [...] "noteworthy because of its superiority to half the stuff in Nas' catalog." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Chris Ryan was less enthusiastic about the album, finding it [...] "somewhat inconsistent, and certainly too scattered to be considered an album per se," [...] even though it features [...] "some classics, such as the nostalgic 'Doo Rags,' that are not to be missed." [...] In its 2007 issue, XXL included The Lost Tapes in its list of [...] "classic" [...] albums to be given the publication's maximum [...] "XXL" [...] rating. In 2012, Complex included The Lost Tapes in their list of [...] "25 Rap Albums From the Past Decade That Deserve Classic Status".|$|E
500|$|The {{demise of}} Star Cops after just nine episodes {{has been seen}} as {{indicative}} of the decline of British television science fiction in the 1980s and, after Doctor Who followed Star Cops into cancellation in 1989, there would be no British regular science fiction drama series on British television until Bugs began in 1995. However, Star Cops has undergone something of a reappraisal – in science fiction circles at least – since it went off the air in 1987. Reviewing the VHS releases for TV Zone in 1991, Gary Russell stated that [...] "Star Cops represents excellent science fiction" [...] and recanted his original impression of the series upon broadcast that it was [...] "Bergerac in spacesuits, complete with rather cruddy visual effects and boring performances". A retrospective article penned by Keith Topping for Dreamwatch to mark the series' 10th anniversary in 1997 described Star Cops as [...] "a series that could (and should) {{have been one of the}} BBC's most popular, influential and entertaining products of the era. On at least one of these points the series failed miserably, but, certainly when it came to entertainment, it succeeded magnificently". In 1999, when science fiction magazine SFX asked an expert panel from the SF field, including Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter, to compile a list of the top 50 SF shows of all time, Star Cops came thirteenth on the list, with SFX describing it as [...] "the SF TV show SF writers love. It wasn't perfect but it's as close as TV <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to producing proper written SF". Later, in 2005, SFX went on to poll its readers for their list of the top 50 British telefantasy shows and Star Cops was voted into twenty-seventh position on the list. The BBC themselves revisited Star Cops in a thirty-minute retrospective documentary about the show, recorded as part of a series titled The Cult of..., first broadcast on BBC Four on 28 November 2006 as part of that channel's Science Fiction Britannia season. Reflecting on the show in the programme, the author and critic Kim Newman said that [...] "the strength of Star Cops is the writing. I don't think any of the episodes are realised as well on screen as they are on the page. [...] If it had come back for another couple of seasons it might well have been the BBC's best science fiction show". The documentary concluded that Star Cops was an [...] "overlooked gem".|$|E

Think about it: we are all sick of the thing, but in some primordial way it is still number one. Everyone knows it... Even our dislike and mockery is ritualistic. The dumb parodies; the Wayne's World-inspired folklore about guitar shops demanding customers not play it; even Robert Plant's public disavowal of the song—all of these just prove the rule. [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] is not just number one. It is the One, the quintessence, the closest AOR <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> you to the absolute.|$|E

In light of his extensive criminal record, he received a 25-years-to-life sentence. Upon arriving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, he warned the warden, [...] "I'll kill the first man that bothers me", and was given a solitary job in the prison laundry room. On June 20, 1929, he beat the laundry foreman to death with an iron bar, {{and was sentenced to}} death. He refused to allow any appeals of his sentence. In response to offers from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, he wrote, [...] "The only thanks you and your kind <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck and that I had my hands on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} December 1941, {{before the}} Wannsee Conference, over 439,800 Jewish people had been murdered, and the Final Solution policy in the east became common {{knowledge}} within the SS. Entire regions were reported [...] "free of Jews" [...] by the Einsatzgruppen. Addressing his district governors in the General Government on 16 December 1941, Governor-General Hans Frank said: [...] "But {{what will happen to}} the Jews? Do you believe they will be lodged in settlements in Ostland? In Berlin, we were told: why all this trouble; we cannot use them in the Ostland or the Reichskommissariat either; liquidate them yourselves!" [...] Two days later, Himmler recorded the outcome of his discussion with Hitler. The result was: [...] "als Partisanen auszurotten" [...] ("exterminate them as partisans"). Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote that the remark is probably as close as historians <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust. Within two years, the total number of shooting victims in the east had risen to between 618,000 and 800,000 Jews.|$|E
2500|$|Chief American Horse was a {{delegate}} to many peace conferences in Washington. During the tumultuous times from 1865 to 1877, [...] American Horse advocated yielding {{to the government}} at any cost, being no doubt convinced of the uselessness of resistance. This quelled the people {{for the time being}} and up to the killing of Crazy Horse. [...] In the crisis precipitated by this event, American Horse was again influential and energetic in the cause of the government. [...] From this time on he became an active participant in the affairs of the Teton Sioux. [...] He was always noted for his eloquence, which was nearly always conciliatory, yet he could say very sharp things of the duplicity of the whites. [...] He had much ease of manner and was a master of repartee. [...] I recall his saying that ”if you have got to wear golden slippers to enter the white man’s heaven no Indian <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> there, as the whites have got the Black Hills and with them all the gold.” “His record as a councilor of his people and his policy in the new situation that confronted them was manly and consistent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1983, {{the members}} of Hüsker Dü wanted to create music outside of the {{confines}} and restrictions of hardcore. In an interview with Matter in 1983, Mould told interviewer Steve Albini, [...] "We're {{going to try to}} do something bigger than anything like rock & roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don't know what it's going to be, we have to work that out, but it's going to go beyond the whole idea of 'punk rock' or whatever." [...] The following year, Hüsker Dü recorded the double album Zen Arcade in 45 hours for the cost of $3,200. Zen Arcade is a concept album following a boy who leaves home to face a harsh and unforgiving world. Its artistic and conceptual ambitions were a great stretch given the purist sentiment then prevalent in U.S. punk rock. Zen Arcade received critical praise and significant mainstream music press attention, ending up on several year-end best-of lists. It also helped expand the band's audience beyond the punk community. In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described Zen Arcade as [...] "the closest hardcore <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to an opera ... a kind of thrash Quadrophenia." [...] In 1989, Zen Arcade was ranked No. 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. SST erred on the side of caution and initially pressed between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album, but the record sold out a few weeks into the band's tour in support of the record. The album remained out of stock for months afterward, which affected sales and frustrated the band.|$|E
