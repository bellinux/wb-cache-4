Others who survived have similar stories: friends stop visiting, employers won't let workers return, communities believe that Ebola is a death sentence and that victims will eventually die so they shun survivors, <b>children</b> and adolescents <b>are</b> rejected by family members and fear inhibits other placement for them. The situation with <b>children</b> <b>is</b> especially troubling. More than 4,000 <b>children</b> <b>are</b> registered as orphans in Guinea.

50|$|The Nurtured Heart Approach (NHA) is {{a social}} {{emotional}} strategy that instills greatness and transforms negative behaviors into positive behaviors, increases interrelatedness and connectivity among family members, couples, teachers and students and builds “Inner Wealth” more commonly known as character strengths and virtues. The NHA was created and developed by Howard Glasser who was discouraged {{by the lack of}} positive results when applying the techniques he had learned in graduate school. Glasser intuitively created this approach by specifically attending to the energy in relationships noticing that more energy and attention went to negative behavior rather than to positive behavior. Howard Glasser continues to expound on his findings for the last two decades resulting in the first Global Summit with topics in research, policy, foster care, mental health organizations, workplace, education, diverse cultures and religious affiliation and with specific psychiatric disorders. The Nurtured Heart Approach to parenting (NHA; Glasser & Easley, 2008) is summarized and evaluated in terms of its alignment with current theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence in family studies and developmental science. Originally conceived and promoted as a behavior management approach for parents of difficult children (i.e., with behavior disorders), NHA is increasingly offered as a valuable strategy for parents of any children, despite a lack of published empirical support. Parents using NHA are trained to minimize attention to undesired behaviors, provide positive attention and praise for compliance <b>with</b> rules, <b>help</b> <b>children</b> <b>be</b> successful by scaffolding and shaping desired behavior, and establish a set of clear rules and consequences. Many elements of the approach have strong support in the theoretical and empirical literature; however, some of the assumptions are more questionable, such as that negative child behavior can always be attributed to unintentional positive reinforcement by parents responding with negative attention. On balance, NHA appears to promote effective and validated parenting practices, but its effectiveness now needs to be tested empirically (Hektner, J, Brennan, A, & Brotherson, S., 2013).|$|R
5000|$|The British Sailors Society {{also ran}} a Children's Home. [...] "Lagarie House" [...] {{was known as}} Lagarie Children's home. The home was {{on the banks of}} the Gareloch on the {{outskirts}} of the village of Rhu, by Helensburgh. The society ran the home from October 1969 until it closed in 1982.Lagarie House was built in 1901 by the renowned architect Alexander Nisbet Paterson (1862-1947). Basically a mansion, it had a large dining room, three reception areas, offices and staff break rooms. It had a total of six dormitories and large bedrooms. The home was intended for use by seafarers whose families were in need of <b>help</b> <b>with</b> their <b>children,</b> <b>be</b> it to give the parents respite during a family crisis or in some cases a home due to the loss of a family member and the father could not manage and go to sea at the same time. It was also used to allow a seafarer to take his wife away with him for a trip while he worked. At one stage up to 60 children being cared for. The home was ran on purely charitable income.|$|R
5000|$|Camilla Rosemary Shand {{was born}} at King's College Hospital, London, on 17 July 1947 at 7:00 am (BST). She {{grew up in the}} Laines, a country house located in Plumpton, East Sussex, and a three-storey house in South Kensington, her family's second home. Her parents were British Army officer turned {{businessman}} Major Bruce Shand (1917-2006) and his wife, the Hon. Rosalind (née Cubitt; 1921-1994), an adoption worker. She has one younger sister, Annabel Elliot, and had a younger brother, Mark Shand (1951-2014). Her maternal great-grandmother, Alice Keppel, was a mistress of King Edward VII from 1898 to 1910. On 1 November 1947, Camilla was baptised at Firle Church, Sussex. Her godparents were Hon. Henry Cubitt (her maternal uncle, later the 4th Baron Ashcombe), Major Neil Speke, Mrs Heathcoat-Amory, Mrs Lombard Hobson and Miss Vivien Mosley. Camilla's mother worked for an adoption agency, while her father had different business interests after retiring from the army. He was most notably a partner in Block, Grey and Block, a firm of wine merchants in South Audley Street, Mayfair, later joining Ellis, Son and Vidler of Hastings and London. During her childhood years, Camilla became an avid reader due to the influence of her father, who read to her frequently. She grew up with dogs and cats, and, at a young age, learnt how to ride a pony by joining Pony Club camps. According to her, childhood [...] "was perfect in every way". Biographer Gyles Brandreth describes her background and childhood: Camilla is often described as having had an [...] "Enid Blyton sort of Childhood". In fact, it was much grander than that. Camilla, as a little girl, may have had some personality traits of George, the tomboy girl among the Famous Five, but Enid Blyton’s <b>children</b> <b>were</b> essentially middle-class <b>children</b> and The Shands, without question, belonged to the upper class. The Shands had position and they had help—help in the house, help in the garden, <b>help</b> <b>with</b> <b>children.</b> They <b>were</b> gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fête. Enough said.|$|R

40|$|With {{reports from}} several studies showing the {{benefits}} of teaching young children about morphemes, this book is essential reading for anyone concerned <b>with</b> <b>helping</b> <b>children</b> to read and write.

As a result, their enjoyment of learning about words increases, and their literacy skills improve.
