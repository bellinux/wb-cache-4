40|$|Abstract. Conformal mapping {{with complex}} {{function}} based on plane elasticity mechanics is an analytical method for resolving stress and displacement {{at any point}} of a half-plane domain. Using complex function conformal mapping method {{in this article we}} investigated the relationship between load on tooth surface and maximum stress at tooth root for calculating the maximum compressive stress {{on the opposite side of}} <b>working</b> <b>flank</b> and maximum tensile stress on <b>working</b> <b>flank</b> side when loads are applied to tooth top and root of <b>working</b> <b>flank</b> side, respectively. The maximum tensile and compressive stress at the tooth root are the main forces that cause fatigue cracking of the tooth root, which may extend along the elastomer compound-cord interface resulting in shear cracking of the belt tooth. The results of our calculation reveal the mechanisms whereby tooth shear cracking causes fatigue failure of synchronic belt, which are consistent with the experimental research results of Lizuka...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tooth {{root and}} bottom {{profiles}} of cylindrical gears affect bending fatigue life, {{but it is}} hard to measure them with conventional gear measuring machines (GMMs), because GMMs are normally customized to measure only gear <b>working</b> <b>flanks.</b> We try to develop a new type of GMM by installing an extra 3 D scanning probe and control software to measure tooth root and bottom profiles. To be able to measure in various directions, a 3 D scanning probe instead of a single directional scanning probe has been attached to a GMM developed, which has servo and linear driving motors generating less heat. Discrete point measurement and scanning measurement of tooth root and bottom profiles of cylindrical gears is described and evaluation of measured results is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{conditions for}} the extraction of useful minerals require {{the formation of a}} working zone of work sites that include statutory reserves of rock and rock masses, ready to be removed. The increase of an open-cast performance by ore leads to increase of width of the work sites. In this case the volume of open-cut mining is growing, both due to a short-term increase in the speed of horizontal promotion of each upstream horizon, and due to changes in the mode of mining operations. The aim of the work is the improvement of methods for determining the volume of open-cut mining ensured normal conditions of the extraction of useful minerals with the change in its performance. We derived formulas for determining the current coefficients of open-cut mining in the expansion of work areas, as well as the volume of debt for opening. Calculations showed that due to an increase in the performance of the open-cast by ore, the open-cut mining ratio also increases, both by reducing the angle of the open pit slope and due to a short-term increase in the speed of horizontal promotion of each upstream horizon relative to downstream, {{as a result of the}} expansion of work sites. Application of methods is possible in the case when mining under project open-cast flanks on day level, and in the case of abandonment of mining in the case of outperformance of <b>working</b> <b>flanks</b> on the project ones. ...|$|R

40|$|The damaged {{collector}} pinion (LH) of {{a helicopter}} was forwarded to the laboratory for investigation. The damage was {{in the form of}} spalling on the <b>working</b> <b>flank</b> of one of the teeth. The spalling had initiated at the dedendum of the tooth and propagated upward progressively. Analysis showed that the spalling was caused due to high surface contact stresses. The situation was further aggravated due to sliding of the contact surfaces.

40|$|Until now, the {{decrease}} of mechanical strength owing to temperature rising is attached great importance {{as the most}} important factor to decide the life cycle (wear, breakage) of plastic gears for power transmisson. But, there is few example that tooth flank temperature is actualy measured. Also, the relation between tooth flank temperature and tooth damage is not examined enough. In this report, tooth flank temperature of plastic gears is measured in detail by usig a radiation pyrometer and the results are obtained as follows: 1. When module is large, average temperature of <b>working</b> <b>flank</b> is high and that the difference of maximum and minimum temperature is large. 2. Pitch point does not always take maximum temperature, there are some cases in which tooth flank temperature is influenced by the interference by teeth of steel gears. 3. Cooling effect of teeth by rotation is affected by gear operating position (driver or follower) and combination of gear materials. 4. It is very effective for preventing temperature rising to cool forcibly the tooth of plastic gears. So, if forced cooling is applied, extention of life cycle can be expected. 5. Breakage point of plastic gear teeth does not always coincide with maximum temperature point...|$|E
40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) drive sleeve, (b) coupling sleeve, (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic chip detector (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of drive and coupling sleeves. The mode of failure in the drive and coupling sleeves was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the drive and coupling sleeves. Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the drive and coupling sleeves because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the <b>working</b> <b>flank</b> of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both drive and coupling sleeves were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the drive and coupling sleeves, however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the drive and coupling sleeves, it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between drive and coupling sleeves...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Executive {{functions}} are high-order aspects of cognition heavily {{dependent upon the}} prefrontal cortex. Both prefrontal cortex activity and executive function task performance are enhanced by participation in aerobic physical activity, suggesting {{that a lack of}} such activity during the bed rest model of prolonged weightlessness might induce executive function deficits. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy males (ages 21 - 45 yr) undertook 60 d of head-down bed rest (- 6 degrees) for the 2 nd Berlin Bed Rest Study (BBR 2 - 2). Three executive function tasks (Iowa Gambling Task, <b>working</b> memory, and <b>flanker)</b> and a reaction time task were administered before, during, and after bed rest. RESULTS: Iowa Gambling Task scores were significantly worse during bed rest (1. 7 +/- 6. 9) than in other sessions (24. 3 +/- 7. 8). Effects on <b>working</b> memory and <b>flanker</b> task performance were less obvious, requiring practice effects to be considered. Reaction time was significantly slower after bed rest (569 +/- 42 ms) than in earlier tests (529 +/- 45 ms). There was also significantly less intrasubject variability in reaction time after bed rest, consistent with more efficient executive functioning at this stage. DISCUSSION: Our results provide some evidence for a detrimental effect of bed rest on executive functioning. Whether this stems from a lack of aerobic physical activity and/or changes in the prefrontal cortex remains to be determined. Cognitive effects of bed rest could have implications for the planned human exploration of Mars, and for medical and lifestyle conditions with inadequate levels of aerobic physical activity...|$|R

60|$|On {{the fall}} of Ross and Le Gallais the command fell upon Major Taylor of U battery. The {{position}} {{at that time was}} sufficiently alarming. The Boers were <b>working</b> round each <b>flank</b> in considerable numbers, and they maintained a heavy fire from a stone enclosure in the centre. The British forces actually engaged were insignificant, consisting of forty men of the 5th Mounted Infantry, and two guns in the centre, forty-six men of the 17th and 18th Imperial Yeomanry upon the right, and 105 of the 8th Mounted Infantry on the left or 191 rifles in all. The flanks of this tiny force had to extend to half a mile to hold off the Boer flank attack, but they were heartened in their resistance by the knowledge that their comrades were hastening to their assistance. Taylor, realising that a great effort must be made to tide over the crisis, sent a messenger back with orders that the convoy should be parked, and every available man sent up to strengthen the right flank, which was the weakest. The enemy got close on to one of the guns, and swept down the whole detachment, but a handful of the Suffolk Mounted Infantry under Lieutenant Peebles most gallantly held them off from it. For an hour the pressure was extreme. Then two companies of the 7th Mounted Infantry came up, and were thrown on to each flank. Shortly afterwards Major Welch, with two more companies of the same corps, arrived, and the tide began slowly to turn. The Boers were themselves outflanked by the extension of the British line and were forced to fall back. At half-past eight De Lisle, whose force had trotted and galloped for twelve miles, arrived with several companies of Australians, and the success of the day was assured. The smoke of the Prussian guns at Waterloo was not a more welcome sight than the dust of De Lisle's horsemen. But the question now was whether the Boers, who were in the walled inclosure and farm which formed their centre, would manage to escape. The place was shelled, but here, as often before, it was found how useless a weapon is shrapnel against buildings. There was nothing for it but to storm it, and a grim little storming party of fifty men, half British, half Australian, was actually waiting with fixed bayonets for the whistle which was to be their signal, when the white flag flew out from the farm, and all was over. Warned by many a tragic experience the British still lay low in spite of the flag. 'Come out! come out!' they shouted. Eighty-two unwounded Boers filed out of the enclosure, and the total number of prisoners came to 114, while between twenty and thirty Boers were killed. Six guns, a pom-pom, and 1000 head of cattle were the prizes of the victors.|$|R
