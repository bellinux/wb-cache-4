40|$|Filament winding {{is gaining}} {{increasing}} importance {{due to the}} widespread availability of modern automation techniques. This requires high designing efforts in order to exploit such a potentiality. For the achievement of high level of accuracy, numeric controlled industrial robots are used to carry special designed delivery eye. Moreover, the necessity to process complex shape objects leads to consider different alternatives to deliver the fiber along the same model. In this paper, we developed a simulation model for such a robotic cell in an integrated software environment. In order to simulate and evaluate the filament winding process, a peculiar methodology has been developed. This investigates on the possibility to perform the <b>winding</b> <b>operation</b> by taking in account various questions such as fiber damaging and degrees of freedom allocation on the robotic cells.

40|$|Abstract Spiral yarn {{composed}} with an elastomeric filament DOW XLA, from Dow Chemical, and wool fibres outwardly wound around the elastic core presents a complex behaviour when wound on bobbins to be dyed. This article presents a basic mathematical model {{with the aim}} of evaluating radial pressure and transversal stress on bobbins at different angles of winding, different yarn tensions and yarn cross-section areas. Considering the additional complexities of the real problem, an experimental comparison of bobbin alterations under different conditions was carried out with the realisation of two experimental sets. The first experimental test bench allows the variation of winding tension, angle of winding and stroke, then experimental tests were carried out on a winding machine SAVIO varying the yarn tension value and adding a mechanical constrain to the device {{with the aim of}} reducing yarn-sliding phenomena, in particular during the thermal cycle. The fundamental parameters have been determined as the angle of wind and the yarn tension during the <b>winding</b> <b>operation.</b> Higher values of wind angle help keeping the bobbin shape. Higher values of yarn tension during <b>winding</b> <b>operation</b> allow the preservation of bobbin shape after the dyeing cycle.

A proposed approach [3] is sensitive to circuit asymmetry and overload operation. A new PCM half-bridge converter with transformer isolation is proposed. The proposed converter uses an auxiliary winding and two diodes with a modified current sense to obtain pulse-by-pulse PCM control that is effective under both normal and fault operating modes. Therefore, the possibility of magnetic saturation due to circuit operation asymmetry is eliminated.

The traveller imparts twist to the yarn and enables winding of the yarn on the cop. However, cooperating assembly, the spindle is required for the <b>winding</b> <b>operation.</b> High contact pressure (up to 35 N/mm 2) is generated between the ring and traveller during winding, mainly due to centrifugal force.

40|$|Filament winding {{products}} {{are widely used}} due to their quality, high strength {{and a series of}} advantages in the industrial areas. The process involves winding filaments under varying amounts of tension over a male mould or mandrel. The tension control product has become the most important object in the process. This study describes the tension force control of filament winding with fuzzy neural network controller design and its application to fiber reinforced plastics. The controller produces the error of the closed loop control system response and the actual system output for the desired tension system, instead of ordinary PID adjustment mechanism. Dynamic performance analysis of a traditional PID controller and fuzzy neural network controller is performed in detail using simulation and experiments. The results show that the system can not only exhibit desired dynamic performance but can also adapt to the wide range of speed and tension force changes by a proper servo motor and <b>winding</b> <b>operation.</b> This study provides the primary theoretical guide for the configuration design, optimization and control research of the FNN applications to industrial winding process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Carcass {{production}} of flexible offshore {{oil and gas}} pipes implies winding and interlocking of a roll formed stainless steel profile around a mandrel in a spiral shape. The location of the dividing point between {{the left and right}} half of the s-shaped profile in the finished carcass is very important as it directly influences carcass flexibility. The target location of the dividing point can be difficult to achieve since undesired degrees of freedom in the winding stage allows the profile to change geometry. The present work investigates this issue by performing production tests of a single carcass profile size on three mandrel sizes showing a size effect to be evident; smaller mandrel size increases a shift of the dividing point during initial mandrel contact in the winding stage. The cause is high strains in the open profile, which are minimized by the material moving closer to profile neutral plane. Other parameters such as profile entry angle on the mandrel and spiral pitch are likely to have significant importance. Proper dividing point position is shown to be obtainable by adjusting the profile in the roll forming stage. The profile rolling is successfully modeled by Finite Element Analysis (FEA), whereas a simplified FE-model of the subsequent <b>winding</b> <b>operation</b> shows that full interlock modeling is required for proper prediction of profile deformation...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{general-purpose}} detectors to {{be provided}} for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project at CERN. The design field of the CMS superconducting magnet is 4 T, the magnetic length is 12. 5 m and the free bore is 6 m. To reinforce the high-purity (99. 998 %) Al-stabilized conductor of the magnet against the magnetic loadings experienced during operation at 4. 2 K, two continuous sections of Al-alloy (AA) reinforcement are Electron Beam (EB) welded to it. The reinforcements have a section of 24 * 18 mm and are produced in continuous 2. 55 km lengths. The alloy EN AW- 6082 has been selected for the reinforcement due to its excellent extrudability, high strength in the precipitation hardened states, high toughness and strength at cryogenic temperature and good EB weldability. Each of the continuous lengths of the reinforcement is extruded billet on billet and press quenched on-line from the extrusion temperature in an industrial extrusion plant. In order to insure the ready EB weldability of the reinforcement onto the pure aluminum of the insert, tight dimensional tolerances and proper surface finish of the reinforcement are required in the as-extruded state. As well, in order to facilitate the <b>winding</b> <b>operation</b> of the conductor, the uniformity of the mechanical properties of the extruded reinforcement, especially at the billet on billet joints, is critical. To achieve these requirements in an industrial environment, substantial effort was made to refine existing production techniques and to monitor critical extrusion parameters during production.

40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the <b>winding</b> <b>operation.</b> It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|E
