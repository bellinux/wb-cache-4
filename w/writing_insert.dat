30|$|When {{it comes}} to the {{performance}} and execution of different types of operations, NoSQL databases are divided mostly into two categories: read and write optimized [21, 91]. That means that, in part, regardless of the system type and records, the database has an optimization that is granted by its mechanisms used for storage, organization and retrieval of data. For example, Cassandra is known for being very highly optimized during execution of <b>writes</b> (<b>inserts)</b> and is not able to show the same performance during reads [21, 91]. The database achieves this by using a cache for write operations (updates are immediately written to a logfile, then cached in memory and only later written to disk, making the insertion process itself faster). In general, Column Store and Key-Value databases use more memory to store their data, some of those being completely in-memory (and, hence, completely unsuited for other attributes such as durability).|$|R
5000|$|If scribes omit {{a letter}} {{where it would}} usually be <b>written,</b> or <b>insert</b> it where it does not belong (hypercorrection), this implies that the sound that the letter {{represented}} had been lost in speech. This happened early with word-initial rough breathing (...) in most forms of Greek. Another example is the occasional omission of the iota subscript of long diphthongs (see above).|$|R
5000|$|The initial UK 12" [...] release {{included}} a folded A4 <b>insert</b> <b>written</b> by Tom Vague which included {{information on the}} group {{in the form of}} a series of short interviews.|$|R
25|$|Notable {{pieces in}} the {{collection}} include a clock with an attached automaton which is able to write, with a miniature <b>writing</b> brush on <b>inserted</b> paper, an auspicious couplet in perfect Chinese calligraphy.|$|R
5000|$|The codex {{contains}} {{lessons from}} the Gospels of John, Matthew, Luke lectionary (Evangelistarium), on 300 parchment leaves (...) [...]The text is written in Greek minuscule letters, in one column per page, 24 lines per page. It contains musical notes and Menologion at the end. The first two leaves and the last two were evidently <b>written</b> and <b>inserted</b> later in place of two damaged leaves, and bear the date A.D. 1067, probably copied from the vanished leaf.|$|R
2500|$|From the beginning, LGE {{proved to}} be an {{enormously}} popular and influential document, quickly acquiring canonical status. Older texts were altered to bring their narratives into closer accord with its version of history, and numerous new poems were <b>written</b> and <b>inserted</b> into it. Within a century of its compilation there existed a plethora of copies and revisions, with as many as 136 poems between them. Five recensions of LGE are now extant, surviving {{in more than a dozen}} medieval manuscripts: ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Spearthrower Owl" [...] {{is a name}} {{invented by}} archaeologists {{basically}} just describing the visual appearance of the Teotihuacan-originated spear-holding owl symbol stylised as one or two Maya glyphs usually used to represent his name. The symbols themselves are not readable Maya <b>writing,</b> even though <b>inserted</b> among otherwise normal glyphs.|$|R
25|$|There are 16 diphthongs (and no triphthongs). A {{distinction}} between diphthongs and monophthongs can be <b>written</b> by <b>inserting</b> a comma in the Latin alphabet. Vowel hiatus is also prevented by inserting an apostrophe, which usually indicates , {{though there are}} other valid realizations. For those who have trouble pronouncing certain consonant clusters, there is the option of adding vowels between them (epenthesis), {{as long as they}} differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. The resulting additional syllables are not factored in the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the work}} [...] "Galvez - Imperador do Acre", {{he began his}} {{literary}} career in 1976. He <b>wrote</b> several works <b>inserted</b> in the socio-cultural environment of the Amazon, such as Mad Maria, Plácido de Castro contra o Bolivian Syndicate, Zona Franca, meu amor, Silvino Santos: o cineasta do ciclo da borracha, among others.|$|R
5000|$|Gaiman {{has said}} {{that members of the}} Hempstock family have shown up in several of his other works, such as Stardust and The Graveyard Book. He began writing Ocean for his wife Amanda Palmer and did not {{initially}} intend for it to become a novel, instead intending to write a novella; while <b>writing,</b> he <b>inserted</b> things that he knew Palmer would enjoy, as she [...] "doesn't really like fantasy". Some events in the book were drawn from Gaiman's childhood, such as the theft of a car belonging to the protagonist's father, mirroring a similar event where his father's car was stolen and the thief committed suicide in the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of using}} {{this method is}} its lack of use of accidentals. While in the numeric system, flats and sharps can be represented either {{by the use of}} fractions (e.g. an A natural in the scale above becomes [...] ) or, more commonly in <b>written</b> text, by <b>inserting</b> an accidental before the number (e.g. the same note becomes 5 or 4).|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{arranged}} by Jester Hairston, for the Sidney Poitier film Lilies of the Field (1963), which popularized the song. Curtis Mayfield said [...] "I'd {{gone to see}} 'Lilies of The Field,' and the song in it, 'Amen,' was very inspiring for me as was the movie [...] [...] [...] Of course, I'd decided to do a version of it. We put it together in the studio starting off with a musical 'swing low sweet chariot', and then we fell into that particular song with somewhat of a marching rhythm." [...] The song was the first Impressions' hit that Mayfield did not <b>write.</b> Mayfield <b>inserted</b> {{the title of the}} song [...] "Keep on Pushing", which was recorded by the Impressions, in-between the lyrics of the song.|$|R
2500|$|Emily's poems were {{probably}} <b>written</b> to be <b>inserted</b> in {{the saga of}} Gondal, several of whose characters she identified with right into adulthood. At the age of 28 she still acted out scenes from the little books with Anne while travelling on the train to York. [...] "Remembrance" [...] {{was one of the}} 21 of Emily's poems that were chosen for the 1846 joint publication before which, Emily had deleted all references to Gondal.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 {{the stamp}} was {{reproduced}} for the London 2010 International Stamp Exhibition by Enschede using the original die. The reproductions had a printed design {{on the back}} similar to a watermark to help distinguish them from the originals. They also had the word [...] printed diagonally across the back in a repeating pattern. The stamps were sold in blocks of four in presentation packs with an <b>insert</b> <b>written</b> by Douglas Muir.|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} anecdote {{will not}} be wholly out of place here, and may perhaps amuse the reader. An amateur performer in verse expressed to a common friend {{a strong desire to}} be introduced to me, but hesitated in accepting my friend's immediate offer, on the score that [...] "he was, he must acknowledge, the author of a confounded severe epigram on my Ancient Mariner, which had given me great pain." [...] I assured my friend that, if the epigram was a good one, it would only increase my desire to become acquainted with the author, and begged to hear it recited: when, to my no less surprise than amusement, it proved to be one which I had myself some time before <b>written</b> and <b>inserted</b> in the [...] "Morning Post," [...] to wit ...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of four digital computer programs for displaying the output from large computer calculations which repeatedly evaluate {{a set of}} parameters (e. g. the system parameters at each time step of the simulation of a physical system, or during an iterative procedure.) The MOVIE program produces moving graphs on the screen of a GT 40 of GT 44 Dataway terminal. The PLOT program allows the user to edit a set of plot commands, view there resulting plots and save the plots and the final set of commands. The PRINT program prints output data on the main printer. IPRINT prints data at the terminal. The data base for all these programs is a dump file <b>written</b> by <b>inserting</b> calls to two supplied subroutines in the original serial calculations...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new practical mechanism for remote data storage with efficient access pattern privacy and correctness. A storage client can deploy this mechanism to issue encrypted reads, <b>writes,</b> and <b>inserts</b> to a potentially curious and malicious storage service provider, without revealing information or access patterns. The provider is unable to establish any correlation between successive accesses, or even to distinguish between a read and a write. Moreover, the client is provided with strong correctness assurances for its operations – illicit provider behavior does not go undetected. We built a first practical system – orders of magnitude faster than existing implementations – that can execute over several queries per second on 1 Tbyte+ databases with full computational privacy and correctness.

5000|$|The Egyptian {{pronunciation}} of ḏḥwty is {{not fully}} known, but may be reconstructed as *ḏiḥautī, based on the Ancient Greek borrowing [...] ( [...] ) or [...] {{and the fact that}} it transliterated into Sahidic Coptic variously as Thoout, Thōth, Thoot, Thaut, as well as Bohairic Coptic Thōout. The final -y may even have been pronounced as a consonant, not a vowel. However, many <b>write</b> [...] "Djehuty", <b>inserting</b> the letter 'e' automatically between consonants in Egyptian words, and writing 'w' as 'u', as a convention of convenience for English speakers, not the transliteration employed by Egyptologists.|$|R
5000|$|Interlineation is a {{legal term}} that signifies <b>writing</b> has been <b>inserted</b> between earlier language. [...] It is {{commonly}} used to indicate the insertion of new language between previous sentences in a contract, though {{it may also be}} used in other contexts. For example, interlineations can help to clarify specific points of a legal contract, and are useful if some of the terms of a contract become unclear later. They are typically initialed and dated, so as to make a record of changes and agreements to a particular contract.|$|R

40|$|Peter. Pecker. Wiener. Dick. Schlong. Penis. Whatever {{we choose}} to call it, the penis {{is more than just}} a body part. This A-to-Z {{encyclopedia}} explores the cultural meanings, interpretations, and activities associated with the penis over the centuries and across cultures. Scholars, activists, researchers and clinicians delve into the penis in antiquity, in art, in religion, in politics, in media, in music, and in the cultural imagination. They examine the penis as a problem, a fetishized commodity, a weapon, an object of play. Penile decor and fashions-from piercings to koteka-are treated with equal dignity. Explanation of common medical terms and not-so-common subcultural practices add to the broad scope of the book. Taken together, the Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis offers refreshing, thoughtful, and wide-ranging insight into this malleable, meaningful body part. As part of this book, I <b>wrote</b> two <b>inserts</b> for the encylopedia, these include 'Urinals' and 'Cock-Supremacy'. The output would be a core text amoungst students of cultural studies, the body, masculinity and health...|$|R
