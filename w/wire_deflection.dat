30|$|Weight {{bearing in}} an Ilizarov frame leads to load {{transfer}} and consequent deflection {{of the frame}} itself. This laxity is primarily due to <b>wire</b> <b>deflection,</b> since connecting rod and ring deformation {{has been shown to}} be minimal at physiological loads [18]. As the frame will act as a load sharing device with the patients’ tissues, it would seem likely that as the fracture unites, increasing fracture site rigidity will reduce movement and load transfer to the wires and therefore subsequent wire deformation [19]. If this <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> can be measured reliably, this variable may therefore offer a surrogate marker of bony consolidation. Whilst <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> has been measured using computational methods such as edge detection [20], there is, to our knowledge, no described method of <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> measurement that is clinically appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the repeatability of our method for assessing <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> in a laboratory setting and to determine if this method could differentiate between an unstable and an intact bone reliably.|$|E
30|$|No entirely {{reliable}} method {{exists for}} assessing union during Ilizarov treatment. Premature removal results in potential treatment failure; hence, alternative methods warrant investigation. <b>Wire</b> <b>deflection</b> might provide {{an indication of}} fracture site deformation on weight bearing, indicating progress towards union. This study aimed to test a method for assessing <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> within an Ilizarov frame. (1) To assess the repeatability of our novel measurement method in measuring <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> within an Ilizarov frame in vitro. (2) To compare the amount of <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> in an unstable model with that in an intact bone model. (3) To assess accuracy of this method by comparing <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> measured with overall machine extension. Tests were performed on clinical grade-tensioned fine wire 4 -ring Ilizarov constructs stabilising a simulated fracture, with and without an unstable defect. Models were sequentially loaded to 700  N using an Instron testing machine. A digital depth gauge attached to the superior ring measured relative wire displacement at the ring closest to the fracture. Tests were repeated 3 times. (1) Both unstable and stable bone models produced highly repeatable load deformation curves (R 2  =  0.98 and 0.99). (2) In the unstable model, wires tensioned at 882 and 1274  N produced mean maximum deflections of 2.41 and 2.69  mm compared with 0.05 and 0.04  mm in the intact bone model (significant p <  0.0001). (3) <b>Wire</b> <b>deflection</b> and machine extension results were strongly correlated (r =  0.99). A measurable difference in <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> between stable and unstable situations exists using this method which appears accurate and repeatable, with clear correlation between displacement and load and displacement and machine extension. This approach might be clinically applicable, and further clinical testing is required.|$|E
30|$|These results {{demonstrate}} that the described method is able to detect and quantify a difference in <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> between a completely stable and unstable model. The relationship between applied load and <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> was reproducible; this remained the case when testing wires with different pretensions. The strong correlation between <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> and overall machine extension indicates that the method provides a promising means of assessing fracture site motion. It is evident that this technique may have clinical application {{which could be used}} to confirm progress to bone union in patients managed with Ilizarov frames. The force applied by the patient could be measured by asking the patient to bear weight through the affected leg on a scale and the <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> measured using the depth gauge and comparing this with the load applied. These results would be compared over time and used to assess progress to union. In addition, complications may be identified earlier if a sudden change in the deflections are seen, indicating a decrease in overall stability.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The static {{crosswind}} displacements of a {{high speed}} pantograph and contact wire are studied. The aim is to assess the overall pantograph sway in crosswinds based on the relative movements of the pantograph and contact wire, {{taking into account the}} crosswind deflection of the train body. The pantograph and <b>wire</b> <b>deflections</b> are derived from simplified models of such structures, whereas train body displacements are computed via Vampire. A spectral approach is used to simulate the turbulent crosswind, which is then used with aerodynamic admittance function to obtain unsteady crosswind loading. Analysis of data shows negligible crosswind deflections of the pantograph itself in the range of few millimeters, but train body and <b>wire</b> <b>deflections</b> are much larger. It is shown that crosswinds may cause the pantograph sway to exceed prescribed limits for some combinations of wind gust and track conditions. ...|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of the flyer winding technology, an {{electric}} coil or winding is produced by feeding the wire via a roll or through a nozzle that is attached to a so-called flyer that is rotating at a certain distance from the coil. The wire is fed by the flyer shaft. For winding the component to be wound, it needs to be fixed inside the winding area of the flyer. It is necessary that the wire is fixed outside of the flyer at any time of the winding procedure. The fixation of the wire is made possible normally by the so-called successive winding method (often used at rotary indexing tables): At the circumference of the table are wire clips or <b>wire</b> <b>deflections</b> that enable a pulling along and with it a fixation of the wire. This will allow a very quick component change, given that no separate depositing of the wire in a wire clip on the machine is required.|$|R
30|$|At {{indirect}} loading, the axial gap movements {{increased at}} a slower rate {{in relation to the}} applied load. To reach the contact point of both bone ends, an axial loading more than 2.5 times higher was necessary. The reason that the needed load was not exactly twice as high as that needed for direct loading might be explained by a self-stiffening effect of the transfixing wires of the proximal bone fragment. Aronson and Harp described an increasing stiffness of the <b>wires</b> with increasing <b>deflection</b> [9]. Because of the increasing stiffness, there is a nonlinearity between the applied load and the <b>wire</b> transverse <b>deflection</b> [19]. The proximal bone fragment in indirect loading covered the whole defect size of 3.5  mm, thereby resulting in a higher deflection of the proximal wires compared to direct loading. The stiffening effect caused by higher <b>deflection</b> of the <b>wires</b> acted as an opposing force and might be the reason for the higher axial loading needed to achieve osteotomy contact in indirect loading.|$|R
30|$|Measurements {{from each}} cycle of testing were taken {{independently}} for analysis. The {{distribution of the}} measured variables was examined using a Shapiro–Wilks test and found to be normal, meeting the assumptions for parametric analysis. Results are presented as a comparison of mean deflections at comparative loads on increasing wire tension. A comparison of mean maximum <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> between the bone defect and united model was also produced. To compare the difference between central tendency of results, the coefficient of determination was calculated using statistical software and an ANOVA test was performed. To compare the correlation of <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> and overall machine extension, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using statistical software. A p value of <  0.05 was used to indicate a statistically significant difference.|$|E
40|$|In {{wire and}} arc {{additive}} manufacture (WAAM), the twist of wire during a robot’s movement {{can result in}} the sudden changes of the wire-feeding position and thus cause deposition defects and dimensional errors. In the worst case, it may cause wire jamming and damage of the wire-feeding system. Therefore, online monitoring and correction of the <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> are very important for WAAM. In this paper, a vision-based measuring method is proposed for detecting the deviations of the wire-feeding position of a plasma welding-based WAAM process. It uses adaptive threshold and Hough transform to extract the wire edges, judges and merges the coincident lines, and applies Radon transform to measure the <b>wire</b> <b>deflection.</b> Software to automatically detect the wire deviation was developed based on the proposed method. The method and the software were verified with experiments...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to note that wires have been shown to slip in the fixation bolts on repeated loading during treatment and lose tension over time [22]. If marked it may alter <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> between measurements were this method employed clinically. It will be important to take this into account during the clinical testing which has been planned.|$|E
5000|$|The concept {{behind the}} Bradbury-Nielsen shutter {{is to apply}} a high {{frequency}} voltage in an 180° out-of-phase manner to alternate wires in a grid which is orthogonal to {{the path of the}} ion beam. This results in charged particles only passing directly through the shutter at certain times in the voltage phase (φ=nπ/2), when the potential difference between the grid wires is zero. At other times the ion beam is deflected to some angle by the potential difference between the neighboring <b>wires.</b> This <b>deflection</b> is divergent with ions that pass through alternate slits being deflected in opposite directions.

50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and the wire guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to <b>wire</b> <b>deflections</b> caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the wire guiding nozzle itself within the wire feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the wire guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|R
30|$|Before each test, {{load cell}} {{calibration}} {{was achieved by}} Bluehill Lite software (v. 2.25, 2005). Assessments of <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> in unloading were performed beginning in 3.1  mm, and from this point, generated values could be measured in 3, 2, 1, and 0.5  mm. The deflection of the wire attached to the bracket corresponds clinically {{to the beginning of}} treatment, when the teeth are poorly positioned and the wire is forced into the slots of the accessories. Depending on the degree of crowding, teeth will experience more or less force so proper alignment occurs.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} has been to investigate a potential method to aid decision-making in determining fracture healing for patients treated with Ilizarov frames. We propose a measurement method for assessing wire displacement on loading utilising a depth gauge attached to the most proximal ring of the frame. The results obtained show a measurable difference in <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> between stable and unstable situations using this method, which appears valid and reliable with clear correlation between displacement and load which agrees with previous research. Clinical testing is now required to ascertain whether the displacement of the wires is equally measurable in vivo and correlates with fracture healing as we expect.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} in translating <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> measurement to clinical application is mounting the measurement device in the small space between the ring of the frame and the patient’s leg. Guidelines dictate that at least 2  cm of clearance should be present between the leg and each ring [21]. In testing, the clearance between the bone substitute and the ring was 4  cm and measurements were easily obtained within this space. Measurements were taken 3  mm away from the bone substitute; therefore, the device should easily fit inside 2  cm of clearance. The soft tissues will, however, mean that it is unlikely one {{would be able to}} measure deflection this close to the bone in clinical practice, which would likely reduce the measured deflection. If the device used is sensitive enough, this should, in itself, not present a problem. Additionally, if the concept is proved useful then a much smaller and specifically designed tool could be engineered for this purpose.|$|E

30|$|A further {{concern over}} {{clinical}} application is {{the stability of}} the models used. It is difficult to model (in vitro) partially healed fractures or the contribution of soft tissues to stability accurately. The models tested were binary, being either completely unstable or completely stable, and {{this is not the case}} in clinic practice. In well-reduced fractures, there may be very little motion at the fracture site even immediately after application and therefore little change in <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> during progress to union. It is unclear what the effect of a uniting bone will be in different clinical situations. Certainly, this method may have application in determining union in patients with multi-fragmented fractures that have no inherent stability and in those with distraction gaps. The low-risk, non-invasive nature of the measurement technique makes such an approach attractive as a next step. Given the heterogeneous nature of the patients involved, such studies will need to be carefully designed and analysed to determine in what situations use of such a device might assist in management decisions.|$|E

In this study, the slicing mechanism of fixed abrasive wire sawing, using an electroplated diamond wire, was investigated experimentally.

Finally, the relationship of the average abrasives cutting depth to slicing characteristics and wafer quality were discussed. It was clarified that the average abrasive cutting depth is closely related to wafer quality and cutting characteristics. The material removal behavior changes with the average abrasives cutting depth.

40|$|Many Wire-EDM {{machines}} {{have adopted}} the pulse generating circuit using low power for ignition and high power for machining. However it is not suitable for finishing process since the energy generated by the high voltage sub-circuit is too high to obtain a desired fine surface, no matter how short the pulse on time is assigned. For the machine used in this research, the best surface roughness Ra after finishing process is about 0. 7 µm. In order to obtain good surface roughness, the traditional circuit using low power for ignition is modified for machining as well. With the assistance of Taguchi quality design, ANOVA and F-test, machining voltage, current-limiting resistance, type of pulse generating circuit and capacitance are identified as the significant parameters affecting the surface roughness in finishing process. In addition, {{it is found that}} a low conductivity of dielectric should be incorporated for the discharge spark to take place. After analyzing the effect of each relevant factor on surface roughness, appropriate values of all parameter are chosen and a fine surface of roughness Ra equals to 0. 22 µm is achieved. The improvement is limited because finishing process becomes more difficult due to the occurrence of short circuit attributed to <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> and vibration when the energy is gradually lowered...|$|E

40|$|The concept development, testing, evaluation, and the {{selection}} of a final wheel design concept for a dual-mode lunar surface vehicle (DLRV) is detailed. Four wheel configurations were fabricated (one open wheel and three closed wheel) (and subjected to a series of soft soil, mechanical, and endurance tests.

40|$|Abstract The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the flexural strength {{and the effects of}} deflection on the surface roughness of esthetic orthodontic wires. The sample consisted of 70 archwire 0. 014 -inch: polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) -coated Nickel-Titanium (Niti) archwires (Titanol Cosmetic-TC, Flexy Super Elastic Esthetic-FSE, esthetic Nickel Titanium Wire-ANT); epoxy resin-coated Niti archwires (Spectra-S, Niticosmetic-TEC); gold and rhodium coated Niti (Sentalloy-STC) and a control group (superelastic Niti (Nitinol-NS). The initial roughness was evaluated with a rugosimeter. After that, the wires were submitted to flexural test in an universal testing machine. Each wire was deflected up to 2 mm at a speed of 1 mm/min. After flexural test, the roughness of the wires was evaluted on the same surface as that used for the initial evaluation. The data of roughness and flexural strength were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey&# 8217;s test (a= 0. 05). Student t-test compared roughness before and after deflection (a = 0. 05). The roughness of S and ANT (epoxy resin and PTFE-coated wires, respectively), before and after deflection, was significantly higher than the other groups (p< 0. 05). <b>Wire</b> <b>deflection</b> significantly increased the roughness of the wires S and STC (p< 0. 05). The flexural strength of groups FSE and NS (PTFE and uncoated) was higher compared with that of the other groups (p< 0. 05). We concluded that the roughness and flexural strength of the orthodontic wires does not depend on the type of the esthetic coating, but it is influenced by the method of application of this coating. The deflection can increase the roughness of the esthetic orthodontic wires...|$|E
40|$|Multicrystalline (MC) silicon {{solar cells}} are {{manufactured}} from bread-loaf sized ingots of solar-grade silicon. These ingots are sliced by a multi-wire saw mechanism {{consisting of a}} single thin and extremely long stainless steel wire wound on constant-pitch wire grooves. The wire is wound over each groove to create a web consisting of 500 - 700 parallel wires. The wire is kept at a constant tension using feedback control and the wire speeds typically are 10 - 15 m/s. A high speed nozzle directs an aqueous slurry of oil and SiC particles {{to the top of}} the wire array and the crystal silicon ingot is pushed upwards against the wire array during the cut. In a typical wire saw system MC ingots are sliced with an area of 100 x 100 square mm and the latest wire saw systems can achieve thicknesses down to 300 microns. What makes this a challenging simulation problem is the wide range of timescales that characterize the overall cutting process. The slowest dynamics are associated with the evolution of the cut, which is described by a spatially dependent differential equation in time and in which the cutting rate is modeled much in the same manner as the Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) process. Cutting rate is a direct function of the distance between the wire and ingot surface. Because the wire dynamics are orders of magnitude faster than cut evolution, the <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> is modeled by a static circular beam.

30|$|The maximum {{recorded}} wire displacement with 884 and 1274  N of pretension was 2.76 and 2.99  mm, respectively. A {{previous study}} [20] measured {{the displacement of}} a single wire loaded perpendicular to its longitudinal axis at its mid-point, recording motion far higher than observed in this research. This is expected as the previous testing involved only one wire which was not fixed within a bone substitute. There is, to our knowledge, no previous study concerning measurement of <b>wire</b> <b>deflection</b> in a composite model. The maximum observed deflection was similar in the models tested with different levels of pretension though, interestingly, slightly higher in the 1274  N test by 0.28  mm. On examining the data further, this appeared {{to be due to}} an outlying measurement of 2.99  mm obtained in the 1274  N testing. We did not use a torque limiter to standardise bolt tightening, and as such this might have been inconsistent. We felt that this better mimicked the situation in clinical practice, but it may have led to this unexpected result if the bolts in this model were tightened less than in others. Another possibility is that at this tension plastic deformation of the wire begins to occur, increasing displacement. To investigate this, a further experiment was carried out by sequentially increasing the applied load to the wire of 1274  N pretension in 25  N increments to 800  N. No obvious change in the linear relationship between load and deformation was observed at higher loads, with the coefficient of determination reducing only slightly from 0.9995 to 0.9982. This change is so slight we cannot determine that the point of plastic deformation was reached. This agrees with results obtained in previous experimental testing. The confidence intervals obtained on repeated testing were very narrow, indicating the high precision of the measurement method used. At 884  N of pretension, the greatest margin of error was 0.19 at a deflection of 2.41  mm. At 1274  N, the greatest margin of error was 0.29 at the maximum deflection of 2.69  mm.

40|$|The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is {{evaluating}} {{the feasibility of}} placing a free electron laser (FEL) {{at the end of}} the linear accelerator. The proposal is to inject electrons two thirds of the way down the linac, accelerate the electrons for the last one third of the linac, and then send the electrons into the FEL. This project is known as the LCLS (Linac Coherent Light Source). To test the feasibility of the LCLS, a smaller experiment VISA (Visual to Infrared SASE (Self Amplified Stimulated Emission) Amplifier) is being performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. VISA consists of four wiggler segments, each 0. 99 m long. The four segments are required to be aligned to the beam axis with an rms error less than 50 {micro}m [1]. This very demanding alignment is carried out in two steps [2]. First the segments are fiducialized using a pulsed wire system. Then the wiggler segments are placed along a reference laser beam which coincides with the electron beam axis. In the wiggler segment fiducialization, a wire is stretched through a wiggler segment and a current pulse is sent down the <b>wire.</b> The <b>deflection</b> of the <b>wire</b> is monitored. The deflection gives information about the electron beam trajectory. The wire is moved until its x position, the coordinate without wire sag, is on the ideal beam trajectory. (The y position is obtained by rotating the wiggler 90 {sup o}.) Once the wire is on the ideal beam trajectory, the wire's location is measured relative to tooling balls on the wiggler segment. To locate the wire, a device was constructed which measures the wire position relative to tooling balls on the device. The device is called the wire finder. It will be discussed in this paper. To place the magnets along the reference laser beam, the position of the laser beam must be determined. A device which can locate the laser beam relative to tooling balls was constructed and is also discussed in this paper. This device is called the laser finder.

Materials and Methods: Four kinds of straight orthodontic rectangular wires (0. 017 inch × 0. 025 inch) were used: stainless-steel (SS), cobalt-chromium-nickel (Co-Cr-Ni), beta-titanium alloy (β-Ti), and nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti). Homogeneous and heterogeneous end-to-end joints (12 mm long each) were made by Nd:YAG laser welding. Two types of welding methods were used: two-point welding and four-point welding. Nonwelded wires were also used as a control. Deflection load (N) was measured by conducting the three-point bending test. The data (n  =  5) were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance/Tukey test (P <. 05). Results: The deflection loads for control wires measured were as follows: SS: 21. 7 ± 0. 8 N; Co-Cr-Ni: 20. 0 ± 0. 3 N; β-Ti: 13. 9 ± 1. 3 N; and Ni-Ti: 6. 6 ± 0. 4 N. All of the homogeneously welded specimens showed lower deflection loads compared to corresponding control wires and exhibited higher deflection loads compared to heterogeneously welded combinations. For homogeneous combinations, Co-Cr-Ni/Co-Cr-Ni showed a significantly (P <. 05) higher deflection load {{than those of the}} remaining homogeneously welded groups. In heterogeneous combinations, SS/Co-Cr-Ni and β-Ti/Ni-Ti showed higher deflection loads than those of the remaining heterogeneously welded combinations (significantly higher for SS/Co-Cr-Ni). Significance (P <. 01) was shown for the interaction between the two factors (materials combination and welding method). However, no significant difference in deflection load was found between four-point and two-point welding in each homogeneous or heterogeneous combination. Conclusion: Heterogeneously laser-welded SS/Co-Cr-Ni and β-Ti/Ni-Ti <b>wires</b> provide a <b>deflection</b> load that is comparable to that of homogeneously welded orthodontic wires...|$|R
