25|$|People have asked, so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then <b>we</b> <b>demand</b> the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then <b>we</b> <b>demand</b> the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, <b>we</b> <b>demand</b> the impossible.|$|E

You have to sentence: we are the elements that destroy your sacred institutions. You have to sentence: it is logical, human. I will always pay tribute to your loyalty. But we say to our friends outside: do not ask for pardon, do not ask for amnesty.

500|$|Wired {{magazine}} called Moog for Love {{one of the}} [...] "6 New Albums <b>We</b> <b>Demand</b> You Listen to Immediately" [...] only for [...] "Feel Like I Do", calling the song [...] "the best Avalanches song the Avalanches didn’t make—and the top-down, sun-kissed track you need in your life right now." [...] Rebecca Haithcoat, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, had a more mixed opinion, writing that while the release garners {{much of the same}} excitements as the [...] "expert blend of sleek pop and those big, warm and happy belted house hooks of the ‘90s" [...] that was on Settle, it was, much like Caracal, not as good as Disclosure's debut given that it was [...] "uninspired" [...] and that none of the songs on the EP were [...] "immediate or necessary." [...] Kyle Forward of DIY magazine was also disappointed with the EP, writing that the songs were only [...] "reminders" [...] of their old sound rather than being something much more than [...] "indistinct nothingness" [...] in addition to their previous sound.|$|E

[...] Robbie Daw of Idolator gave the song a positive review, while complimented Minaj's dual rapping and singing, {{as well as the}} use of the sample. Backy Bain also of Idolator additionally gave the song a positive review stating [...] "We were a bit worried that Harujuku Barbie would forever be the garnish on other people’s tracks instead of the main dish, but this sweet song proves otherwise." [...] Mariel Concepcion of Billboard commented on Minaj toning it down stating, [...] "the Young Money rap princess puts the sleazy talk aside and finds herself smitten with a young man... Minaj proves that even the wildest ones can be tamed." [...] While reviewing the music video, Brad Wete also of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the song positively, stating that Minaj was [...] " [...] slicing the competition to pieces with her second try." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic deemed the song an album highlight, additionally adding that the song, [...] "waltzes out of the speakers. In 2014, Pitchfork named it the best Nicki Minaj single." ...|$|E

Our results are relatively consistent in New York and Florida, including evidence that catastrophe demand is more price elastic than noncatastrophe <b>demand.</b> <b>We</b> also find evidence that consumers value options that expand coverage, buy more insurance when it is subsidized through regulatory price constraints, and consider state guaranty fund provisions when purchasing insurance.

It is the argument that today, if we go before the laborers, we must offer them something right away. I answer to you that today, if we are to go into the field of competitive bidding for votes, either of the old political parties can outbid us.
