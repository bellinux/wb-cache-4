40|$|For {{crystallized}} mesoporous carbon (CMC) {{obtained by}} carbonization of nickel-loaded larch at 900 ℃, its liquid phase adsorption capacity for dyes and dextrans was examined {{before and after}} pulverization followed by <b>washing</b> <b>with</b> <b>acid.</b> By pulverization, graphitic nano shell chains as the crystallized form of CMC were fragmented into raspberry-shaped nano shell carbon particles accompanying the increase of mesopore volume and width. These morphological and pore structural changes brought about great increase in the adsorption amounts of both adsorbates. Subsequent <b>washing</b> <b>with</b> <b>acid</b> to remove coexisting nickel led to further increase {{in the amount of}} dextrans to surpass commercial mesoporous carbon in the adsorption capacity, although it was disadvantageous for the adsorption of dyes. As removal of the metal for its recovery and reuse is also industrially preferable, pulverization and subsequent <b>washing</b> <b>with</b> <b>acid</b> were post-treatments suitable for practical production of an adsorbent for non-polar polymers from CMC. カラマツの 900 ℃ニッケル触媒炭化で得られた結晶性メソ孔木炭(CMC) について、染料とデキストランの液相吸着能を粉砕-酸洗浄の前後で調べた。粉砕するとCMCの結晶形態であるグラファイトナノシェルチェーンはラズベリー型のナノシェル炭素に分解すると共にメソ孔の体積と径が増大した。これらの形態と細孔構造変化は両吸着物の吸着量を大きく増加させた。引き続く共存ニッケル除去のための酸洗浄はデキストランの吸着量をさらに増加させ、市販のメソ孔炭素の性能を上回った。回収、再使用のためのニッケル除去は工業的にも好ましいので、粉砕と引き続く酸洗浄はCMCからの非極性高分子吸着剤の実用生産に適した後処理であった...|$|E

Chitin and its {{derivative}} chitosan, a mucopolysaccharide like glycoaminoglycan {{have been reported to}} be useful for biomedical applications like wound healing and dressings, drug delivery agents, anti- cholesterolemic agents, blood anticoagulants, anti- tumor agents and immunoadjuvants. It is predicted that chitosan {{will be one of the}} most demanding material in 2005. About 75 % of this key material will be used in biomedical areas. Materials and methods : In this study chitin and chitosan (deacetylated derivative) were prepared from shrimp shells of Iran. Shrimp shell powder was treated by an appropriate acid in a proper condition. After filtration the precipitated impure chitin was washed and purified. The precipitate was treated with NaOH and chitosan was obtained in this stage. The product was mixed with hot KOH.

40|$|Chemical Cleaning is {{currently}} in progress for Tanks 5 and 6 at the Savannah River Site. The Chemical Cleaning process is being utilized to remove the residual waste heel remaining after completion of Mechanical Sludge Removal. This work is required to prepare the tanks for closure. Tanks 5 and 6 are 1950 s vintage carbon steel waste tanks that do not meet current containment standards. These tanks are 22. 9 meters (75 feet) in diameter, 7. 5 meters (24. 5 feet) in height, and have a capacity of 2. 84 E+ 6 liters (750, 000 gallons). Chemical Cleaning adds 8 wt % oxalic acid to the carbon steel tank to dissolve the remaining sludge heel. The resulting acidic waste solution is transferred to Tank 7 where it is pH adjusted to minimize corrosion of the carbon steel tank.

40|$|INTRODUCTIONIt is {{imperative}} that the slides and coverslips used in fluorescence microscopy procedures be extremely clean. Although coverslips look clean, especially when a new box is first opened, {{they may have a}} thin film of grease on them that will not allow tissue culture cells to adhere well and that may interfere with some processing steps in certain protocols. Therefore, coverslips should routinely be <b>washed</b> <b>with</b> <b>acid</b> or base solutions to rid them of this film. Commercial precleaned slides are also likely to be dirty and must be washed prior to use. This protocol describes various approaches for cleaning slides and coverslips and sterilizing them for cell culture, as well as methods for subbing slides. In the subbing procedure, slides are coated with gelatin, aminoalkylsilane, or poly-L-lysine solution to promote the adhesion of cells or tissues to the glass surface. Gelatin or aminoalkylsilane is usually used for tissue sections or small organisms, whereas poly-L-lysine is routinely used for cultured cells...|$|R
