I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Amerie {{returned}} to the studio to work on her third album, Because I Love It, enlisting producers such as The Buchanans, One Up, Mike Caren. The album was her first not to feature writing and production from her long-time collaborator, friend, and producer Rich Harrison. She cited music of the 1980s as {{a major influence on}} the album, saying [...] "I love 80's music period! That's why I did Because I Love It, since it had mostly R, soul, and 80's new wave. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do that in 2006, people were like, 'what?!' [...] but I love it." [...] "Take Control", which was co-produced by Mike Caren, Amerie and Nicholson and co-written by Amerie along with Cee-Lo Green, became a top 10 hit in the UK in mid 2007. Because I Love It was released on May 14, 2007, in Europe, Asia and Australasia, reaching the top 20 in the UK, where the album's second single, [...] "Gotta Work", reached number 21.

2500|$|Even as {{the film}} {{was in the first}} weeks of its 1989 {{theatrical}} release, rumors were circulating of a wave sequence missing from the film's end. As chronicled in the 1993 laserdisc Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and Industrial Light & Magic's then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing to sit through the entire film, though 1990's Dances with Wolves would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the [...] "Scenes I liked most" [...] and [...] "Scenes I liked least" [...] fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long {{as the film}} met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, [...] "Ironically, the studio brass were horrified <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was cutting the wave." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kylie Christmas is Minogue's first Christmas studio {{album and}} her thirteenth overall studio album. Minogue {{previously}} released the Christmas track [...] "Santa Baby", which appeared on her 2000 single, [...] "Please Stay"; {{a recording of}} [...] "Let It Snow" [...] in 2010; and two Christmas extended plays in 2010, A Kylie Christmas and A Christmas Gift. Speaking with Idolator's Mike Wass, Minogue stated [...] "I always thought I would do a Christmas album, {{it was just a}} case of when... I mentioned it to a couple of people on my team and they were saying, 'What {{do you want to do}} for the rest of the year? What do you want to do next?' I said, 'I'm thinking about a Christmas album, actually.' Some of that stems from last Christmas." [...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've got to do it. It would be amazing. We just want to see your little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material. American guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers and Minogue's sister Dannii Minogue were reported to be working on the album, while The Sun claimed she had recorded [...] "half of the album".|$|E
