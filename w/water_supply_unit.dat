40|$|The National Weather Service (NWS) has a {{long history}} in {{forecasting}} seasonal run off volumes in the western United States where snow melt is the dominant component. The NWS (known as the Weather Bureau at the time) first opened the <b>Water</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>Unit</b> in Salt Lake City in 1947 to issue ten seasonal supply forecasts. Today, official forecasts are generated by six River Forecast Centers (RFCs) and coordinated with other agencies. NWS forecasts rely on two fundamental tools: Statistical Water Supply (SWS) and Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). SWS employs multivariate regression equations based primarily on the observed snow pack to date as well as other predictors such as climate indices and antecedent conditions to predict the seasonal run off volumes. ESP, by contrast, uses the continuous hydrologic model at the RFCs together with some prediction of future weather and climate to generate a forecast seasonal streamflow volume. NWS hydrologic forecasters contribute their expertise to produce forecasts at least monthly between January and June across the western United States. Recent and ongoing advances in forecast technology include improvements to ESP that increasingly account for meteorological and climate forecasts and include measures of uncertainty. Comparisons are shown between the various ESP methods accounting for climate and weather forecasts. Ongoing development is taking place in product delivery as well. A new web presence is being developed to present a consolidated picture of all NWS water supply forecasts as well as allow forecast users access to information from each forecast tool. Forecast verification information is also being developed to aid users, forecasters, and managers in making the best decisions possible based on the forecast...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due {{to their}} better {{mechanical}} and physical properties diamond tools have largely replaced cemented carbide tools for machining of mineral materials like concrete and rocks. The decomposition tendency of diamond {{has to be}} taken into consideration during the manufacturing process as well as during their employment in machining tools. By using water cooling the diamond decomposition is reduced, but the contamination of occupied buildings by concrete/rock-water-mixture and the need of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>units</b> on building sites are unfavourable. However, absence of water cooling lead to an increased tribological and thermal wear of conventional diamond tools. Due to the heat development the diamonds in direct contact with mineral materials as well as the diamonds in deeper layers are deteriorated. The Institute of Materials Engineering pursues a novel thermal protection shield concept, in which thermal insulating materials such as Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2 or glass in diamond impregnated composite structures act as heat shield, which protects diamonds in deeper layers against high temperature and graphitisation. Before the effectiveness of this concept could be investigated suitable composites have to be manufactured. In this paper the powder metallurgical production processes of diamond-alumina-cobalt-composites with varying alumina and cobalt particle sizes, their microstructures and porosities are described. In comparison to composites with larger alumina particle sizes it could be observed that the distribution of alumina particles with particle sizes below 70 µm in the cobalt matrix is uniform and the porosity of the composite decrease...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSome infections cases due to {{exposure}} to output water from dental unit waterlines (DUWL) {{have been reported}} in the literature. However, this type of healthcare-associated risk has remained unclear and up until now the overall bacterial composition of DUWL has been poorly documented. In this study, 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing was used to investigate the bacterial community in seven dental offices (N =  7) and to identify potential bacterial pathogenic sequences. Dental unit waters (DUW) were collected from the tap <b>water</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>units</b> (Incoming Water; IW) to the output exposure point of the turbine handpiece (Output water; OW) following a stagnation period (OWS), and immediately after the last patient of the sampling day (OWA). A high bacterial diversity was revealed in DUW with 394 operational taxonomic units detected at the genus level. In addition to the inter-unit variability observed, results showed increased total bacterial cell concentration and shifts in bacterial community composition and abundance at the genus level, mainly within the Gamma- and Alpha-Proteobacteria class, as water circulated in the dental unit (DU). Results showed that 96. 7 %, 96. 8 % and 97. 4 % of the total sequences from IW, OWS and OWA respectively were common to the 3 defined water groups, thereby highlighting a common core microbiome. Results also suggested that stagnation and DU maintenance practices were critical to composition of the bacterial community. The presence of potentially pathogenic genera was detected, including Pseudomonas and Legionella spp. Emerging and opportunistic pathogenic genera such as Mycobacterium, Propionibacterium and Stenotrophomonas were likewise recovered in DUW. For the first time, an exhaustive evaluation of the bacterial communities present in DUW was performed taking into account the circulation of water within the DU. This study highlights an ignored diversity of the DUWL bacterial community. Our findings also contribute to a better appreciation of the potential infectious risk associated with dental care and suggest the importance of better managing microbial quality in DUW...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficiency}} of different disinfectants applicable to Legionella control in domestic water systems. A domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> simulation <b>unit</b> that allowed simulation of real-world conditions was developed for this purpose. The system, consisting of seven identical rigs, was used to compare treatment efficiency under equivalent conditions of system design, materials, hydraulics, water quality, temperature and initial contamination. During the study, each of six loops received continuous application of one of the following disinfectants: chlorine, electro-chlorination, chlorine dioxide, monochloramine, ozone, or copper/silver. The seventh loop was used as a control and remained untreated. Performance evaluation of these disinfectants was based on their ability to reduce not only Legionella, but also protozoa and biofilms, which contribute to the establishment and dissemination of these bacteria in water systems, and their resistance to treatments. Regarding these criteria, chlorine dioxide and chlorine (as bleach or obtained by electro-chlorination) were the most effective treatments in this study. However, in comparison with chlorine, chlorine dioxide showed a longer residual activity in the system, which constituted an advantage in the perspective of an application to extensive pipework systems.

40|$|Recycling of {{the spent}} rinse water {{discharged}} from the wet benches commonly used in semiconductor processing is one tactic for responding to the targets for water usage published in the 1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS). Not only does the NTRS list a target that dramatically reduces total water usage/unit area of silicon manufactured by the industry in the future but for the years 2003 and beyond, the NTRS actually touts goals which would have semiconductor manufacturers drawing less water from a regional <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> per <b>unit</b> area of silicon manufactured than the quantity of ultrapure water (UPW) used {{in the production of}} that same silicon. Achieving this latter NTRS target strongly implies more widespread recycling of spent rinse waters at semiconductor manufacturing sites. In spite of the fact that, by most metrics, spent rinse waters are of much higher purity than incoming municipal waters, recycling of these spent rinse waters back into the UPW production plant is not a simple, straightforward task. The rub is that certain of the chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing, and thus potentially present in trace concentrations (or more) in spent rinse waters, are not found in municipal <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> and are not necessarily removed by the conventional UPW production sequence used by semiconductor manufacturers. Some of these contaminants, unique to spent rinse waters, may actually foul the resins and membranes of the UPW system, posing a threat to UPW production and potentially even causing a shutdown...|$|R

Some 1. 2 million people are living in the Bukhara oasis, the oldest irrigated zone of Uzbekistan. Irrigation practice in the more than 230, 000 ha of land consumes more than 5 km 3 of Amu Darya river water. The future development of irrigated agriculture and the environmental situation in the Aral Sea Basin requires analysis of current water management in the irrigated areas of Uzbekistan. Until the 1960 s, Bukhara Oasis received water for irrigation from the Zarafshan River, which originates in Tajikistan, flows through Tajikistan, three provinces of Uzbekistan.

In the beginning of 1960 s, water shortage in the irrigated agriculture of Bukhara Oasis reached its apogee, composing 50 to 55 percent from annual water requirement. As a solution to the water shortage problem of Bukhara oasis, a canal was built from Amu Darya - the largest water body of Central Asia. In the beginning of the 1970 s, canal Amu-Bukhara was finished and Bukhara Oasis began to receive water from more reliable source.
