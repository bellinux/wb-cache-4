5|$|Developmental verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production.

A child <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E

40|$|Child {{behaviour}} {{problems are}} common in children <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disorder. Previous evidence suggests that behavioural parenting programs are effective with parents of children, aged 2 - 10 years, <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disorder. Forty-nine parents of children <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disorder attended a 5 -hour Stepping Stones Triple P seminar series program which explained parenting strategies targeted specifically at parents of children <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disorder. Parents {{were asked to rate}} the acceptability of the seminar series, the usefulness of the parenting strategies and their intention to participate in further Stepping Stones Triple P programs after the seminar series. Barriers which prevented parents from participating in the program were also identified. It was found that the SSTP seminar series is an acceptable format for delivering a broad, educational parenting program to parents of a child <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disorder. Furthermore, the strategies presented in the seminar series were useful for parents of a child <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disorder <b>with</b> a substantial proportion of parents reporting successfully using both the positive parenting strategies and the strategies for managing misbehaviour. The seminar series fits within the Triple P model with some parents indicating the seminar series was sufficient for their needs whilst others indicating their intention to seek further SSTP programs. The SSTP seminar program could, therefore, be a useful addition to the suite of Triple P programs for parents of a child <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disorder and {{has the potential to be}} a cost effective, public health program that can be delivered to a large number of parents of children with a range of developmental disorders across a variety of locations...|$|R

5|$|In {{individuals}} <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> disabilities, {{occurrence of}} self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) prioritizes that {{content on}} diverse and oppressed populations be infused {{throughout}} the curriculum in accredited programs in Social Work. Studies conclude {{that there is}} a lack of information and content on social work services with persons <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disability and their families in Graduate programs in Social Work across the United States. The population of persons <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disability is steadily increasing as there are more infant and child diagnoses and prolonged life expectancy for adults <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disability. This increase in the population and emerging area of aging persons <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disability creates a demand for knowledgeable, competent, and culturally sensitive social workers to provide best practice services and meet the needs of these persons in a variety of social service settings. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the depth and breadth of curricula focused on content related to Social Work Practice with Persons <b>with</b> a <b>Developmental</b> Disability through surveying MSW II students at California State University, Sacramento.

This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E
5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E

40|$|Background Children <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> {{disability}} {{are three}} to four times more likely than their typically developing peers of developing significant emotional and behavioural problems. There is strong evidence to suggest that individual biological and psychological factors interact with family functioning to precipitate and perpetuate these problems. Aims This study examined the psychometric properties of a brief measure, the Parent and Family Adjustment Scales (PAFAS) for use with parents of children <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disability. Methods A sample of 914 parents of children (M = 6. 27 years) <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disability participated in the study. Disabilities included Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability Results A confirmatory factor analysis supported a 16 -item, four factor model of PAFAS Parenting, and an 11 -item, three factor model of PAFAS Family Adjustment. The Parenting Scale measures parental consistency, coercive practices, use of encouragement and the quality of parent-child relationship. The Family Adjustment Scale measures parental emotional adjustment and partner and family support in parenting. Conclusions The current study indicated that the PAFAS demonstrates promise as a brief measure of multiple domains of family functioning important for families who have a child <b>with</b> a <b>developmental</b> disability...|$|R
