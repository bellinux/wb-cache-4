40|$|We have identified, and {{followed}} the development of three macrogamete organelles involved {{in the formation of}} the oocyst wall of Eimeria maxima. The first were small lucent vacuoles that cross-reacted with antibodies to the apple domains of the Toxoplasma gondii microneme protein 4. They appeared early in development and were secreted during macrogamete maturation to form an outer veil and were termed veil forming bodies. The second were the <b>wall</b> <b>forming</b> bodies type 1, large, electron dense vacuoles that stained positively only with antibodies raised to an enriched preparation of the native forms of 56 (gam 56), 82 (gam 82) and 230 kDa (gam 230) gametocyte antigens (termed anti-APGA). The third were the <b>wall</b> <b>forming</b> bodies type 2, which appeared before the <b>wall</b> <b>forming</b> bodies type 1 but remain enclosed within the rough endoplasmic reticulum and stained positively with antibodies raised to recombinant versions of gam 56 (anti-gam 56), gam 82 (anti-gam 82) and gam 230 (anti-gam 230) plus anti-APGA. At the initiation of oocyst wall formation, the anti-T. gondii microneme protein 4 positive outer veil detached from the surface. The outer layer of the oocyst <b>wall</b> was <b>formed</b> by the release of the contents of <b>wall</b> <b>forming</b> bodies type 1 at the surface to form an electron dense, anti-APGA positive layer. The <b>wall</b> <b>forming</b> bodies type 2 appeared, subsequently, to give rise to the electron lucent inner layer. Thus, oocyst wall formation in E. maxima represents a sequential release of the contents of the veil <b>forming</b> bodies, <b>wall</b> <b>forming</b> bodies types 1 and 2 and this may be controlled at the level of the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi body...|$|R

50|$|The {{dwelling}} {{also shows}} how the sexes lived apart under one roof. Wide hallways separate the brethren's rooms from the sisters' rooms; separate doors and stairways {{for men and women}} meant that a sister never had to pass a brother going through those openings. Men and women ate at opposite ends of the dining room. The dwelling also has features unusual in habitations of their era; interior windows for borrowed light to illuminate an otherwise-dark stairwell, built-in cabinets and cases of drawers, dumb-waiters for moving food and dishes between the downstairs kitchen and the dining room on the floor above, an abundance of windows for light and ventilation. All of the windows in the building, rather than having a 90 degree angle with the <b>wall,</b> <b>form</b> a 45 (approx.) degree angle in the wall, which allows approximately 30 percent more light into the building—something that significantly keep the electrical bills low while experiencing more natural light.|$|E
