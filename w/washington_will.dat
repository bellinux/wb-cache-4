She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, <b>Washington</b> <b>will</b> win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E
