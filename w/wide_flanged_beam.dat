40|$|Behavior of <b>wide</b> <b>flanged</b> <b>beams</b> is of much {{importance}} to civil engineers {{as this one}} of the main materials used in steel structures. Openings are made in the web of beams to pass services pipes {{from one side of the}} building to another, when these openings are made in the beams, the shear and moment capacity at this section will be reduced. This will increase stresses at this section of the beam and will subsequently affect the stress distribution in the beam with web opening. Longitudinal stiffeners are placed at the top and bottom edges of the web opening to increase both moment and shear capacity at the section with web opening. Four samples were used in this study; a solid wide flange beam, a wide flange beam with web opening and two beams with reinforced web openings. The von Mises stress and the first principal stresses were obtained from the nonlinear static analysis. The results from a nonlinear finite element analysis of the four simply supported beams are discussed. The AISC steel design guide series 2 provide equations for the design of reinforced web opening. The reinforced web opening beam using the AISC guidelines is evaluated by comparing it to the finite element analysis...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) <b>flanged</b> <b>beam</b> specimens {{were tested}} under incremental cyclic load till failure in flexure. Simultaneously the acoustic emissions (AE) known as transient elastic stress waves released during fracture {{process in the}} same specimens were recorded. These RC <b>flanged</b> <b>beam</b> specimens were cast with different percentage of steel reinforcement (area of steel reinforcement {{as a percentage of}} the effective area of beam cross section). Crack widths depend on tensile stress in steel reinforcement present in a RC structural member. Because crack opening is a function of tensile stress in the steel rebars, the percentage of steel in the RC members influence the AE released during fracture process. In this article, a study on damage occurred in RC <b>flanged</b> <b>beam</b> specimens having different percentage of steel reinforcement using acoustic emission testing is reported. A relation between the total AE energy released and percentage of steel in RC beams has been proposed. As the percentage of steel present in the test specimen was increased, the loading cycle number entering into the heavy damage zone in NDIS- 2421 damage assessment chart also increased...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In an {{analysis}} of reinforced concrete structure the flexural stiffness of section is an important parameter and {{the change in the}} value of flexural stiffness may result in significant change in analysis result. The current study aims to estimate the reduction in flexural stiffness of reinforced concrete <b>flanged</b> <b>beam</b> sections subjected to lateral loading and take the cracking effect of reinforced concrete section into account. The reduction in flexural stiffness due to earthquake shaking may increase the lateral deflection and it can be significantly greater as compared to deflection estimated using gross flexural stiffness. To take this effect into consideration, the design code of some countries suggest reduction factors or equations to reduce the gross flexural stiffness to effective flexural stiffness but they have some drawbacks because not consider all important parameters in there equation. However in Indian seismic code IS 1893 (2002) and many countries there are no provisions to account for reduction in stiffness due to concrete cracking. Analytical work in present study identified the parameters and influences of these parameters on effective stiffness are determined and suggest the simplified but reasonable accurate expression for computation of effective stiffness of reinforced concrete <b>flanged</b> <b>beam</b> section. Proposed equations can be easily use by designer to estimate the effective stiffness of reinforced concrete <b>flanged</b> <b>beam</b> sections accurately...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the application of genetic algorithms to the minimum cost design of continuous beams cast in situ with reinforced concrete slabs to form an integral structure. A practical “problem-seeks-optimum design” approach requires full consideration of these rigidly jointed beam-and-slab connections, together with realistic multiple loading conditions and limit states as embodied in British and European Codes of Practice. The fitness function includes the cost of concrete, longitudinal and shear reinforcement, {{and the cost of}} formwork and labour. Results obtained so far have shown that genetic algorithms can be successfully applied to the minimum cost design of <b>flanged</b> <b>beams,</b> overcoming the difficulties associated with the discontinuity of the design equations and their complex inter-relationship with the design variables...|$|R
5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a <b>wide</b> <b>flanged</b> profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|R

50|$|Muggiaea atlantica {{is a small}} colonial siphonophore, {{but one of the}} two nectophores (swimming bells) is undeveloped. The {{remaining}} nectophore {{grows to}} a length of about 7 mm. It is translucent and has five straight, longitudinal ridges, some of which may form a keel. The hydroecium (ventral cavity) is about one third of the length of the nectophore, and the long slender somatocyst (extension of the gastrovascular system) reaches the apex of the nectosac (central cavity) and sometimes contains oil droplets. The eudoxid (reproductive stage) soon becomes detached. It has a cone-shaped, asymmetric bract with a <b>wide</b> <b>flanged</b> suture running from apex to base. The right edge of the bract is curved while the left edge is truncated horizontally. The lower surface has a small cavity in which the somatocyst is situated.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flanged</b> <b>beams</b> {{usually have}} web's that are {{relatively}} thin and thus weak when placed in compression. Hence, it behaves {{in a manner}} similar to that of a column in compression 1, a reasonable assumption backed by experimental data. Therefore, vertical buckling of the web will occur as one of the four types shown in fig. l. a. depending on the type and condition of support of the top flange. This kind of buckling usually occurs where there are large concentrated loads such as the reactions at the beam supports or where there are columns or other beams laying on the top flange. There is also the possibility of the web failing as shown in fig. l. b. which is called web crippling. Experience and tests have shown that if a beam will not fail due to web crippling it will also be safe from vertical buckling. Thus, only web crippling is usually investigated which will account for vertical buckling...|$|R
40|$|The {{test results}} of nine shear-critical {{partially}} prestressed concrete <b>flanged</b> <b>beams</b> {{with and without}} steel fibers are presented in this paper. T-beam specimens were cast with three grades of concrete: normal strength (35 MPa [5. 07 ksi]), moderately high strength (65 MPa [9. 42 ksi]), and high strength (85 MPa [12. 32 ksi]). For each grade of concrete, three beams were cast: a control beam without fiber reinforcement, a beam with fiber reinforcement over the full depth of the cross section, and a beam with fiber reinforcement only in the web portion. Test {{results indicated that the}} provision of fiber reinforcement only in the web portion appreciably improved the shear-resisting capacity of the partially prestressed) beams. A model to predict the shear strength of prestressed and reinforced (nonprestressed) concrete beams has been proposed. The proposed model is expected to predict the test results of reinforced concrete beams having steel fibers over partial and full depth...|$|R

[...] Stobie and John Brookman were so confident of the new pole that they formed The Stobie Pole Syndicate for the purpose of patenting the design and then selling the patent or manufacturing rights. The Hume Pipe Company became their first agents and, while there were numerous international enquiries, South Australia has largely remained the only place where they are widely used.|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{research}} is done on RC beams strengthened with FRP subjected to shear and flexure. Many structural members such as curved girders, space frames, eccentrically loaded beams, spandrel beams in buildings, and spiral staircases are subjected to torsional moment. Beyond plane rectangular nature, structural member can be of T shape, L shape or box section. These various shapes create difficulty in understanding torsion in RC members (Panchacharam and Belarbi 2002). Elwan (2017) worked on <b>flanged</b> <b>beams</b> retrofitted with FRP system subjected to torsional moment. Though shear and torsion both produced diagonal cracks in RC beam, behavior of RC beam subjected to torsion is different. Due to shear, crack propagates in the same direction on both sides of the beam, whereas due to torsion spiral cracks propagate {{in the opposite direction}} {{on opposite sides of the}} beam. Alabdulhady et al. (2017) used PBO-FRCM composites to improve torsional resistance of reinforced concrete beams. Zhang et al. (2001), Hii and Al-Mahaidi (2006), Jing et al. (2007), Mohammadizadeh and Fadeel (2009) and Deifalla et al. (2013) worked on the torsional behavior of different types of reinforced concrete beam externally strengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP).|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes the}} concepts involved {{in design and}} construction of a reinforcement-free bridge deck intended to provide cost effective, durable and more rapid construction for highway bridges. The new <b>wide</b> <b>flanged</b> or bulb tee precast prestressed concrete girder sections currently used in bridges allow for a shorter effective span for the bridge deck because of the wide girder flanges. The failure mode of concrete decks on these girders {{is expected to be}} a punching shear mode as the span of the deck becomes shorter. The shear forces from the vehicle wheel loads in the deck of this innovative bridge are designed to be carried by restrained membrane action without using reinforcing in the concrete. The restrained membrane action is enhanced by the natural lateral stiffness of the wide girder flanges and by tying adjacent girders together with steel tie rods placed between the webs. A construction case study of the newly developed system as applied by the Wisconsin DOT in a prototype bridge on a U. S. highway and the relevant development and testing conducted by the University is included...|$|R

The aim is to study the feasibility of relaxation ratio analysis of AE signals for damage assessment in RC beams. The beam specimens were tested in the laboratory under incremental cyclic loading. The loading cycle first entered into the relaxation dominant phase in the relaxation ratio plot was equal or close to the loading cycle entering first into the heavy damage zone in the NDIS- 2421 damage assessment plot proposed by Japanese society for nondestructive inspection. Further, the lowest AE based b-value was observed at the same or nearer loading cycle. Relaxation ratio analysis of AE signals is a useful method to assess the current load carrying capacity of a structure and state of damage in concrete structures in-situ. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|In {{a typical}} fall a descent by a gliding ant is [...] "J-shaped". The ant will first {{randomly}} descend {{three or four}} metres in free fall, then visually lock on to the tree trunk it wishes to land on. The glide ant then, while exhibiting a sort of parachuting behaviour to slow its fall, uses its flatten head, hind legs and abdomen like wings or a parachute to make a rapid adjustment to point its abdomen (or head) towards the tree trunk. The ant then turns upside down and lands on the trunk, head facing the earth. The period of free fall {{is thought to be}} used by the ants to slow down to a minimum viable glide velocity, to allow them to successfully direct their descent towards the tree. This explains why smaller ants have been observed to reach their trees sooner than do larger. A smaller body mass makes it easier to slow to the minimum viable glide velocity, allowing smaller ants to gain control of their falls more quickly. Many ants use long, flattened legs and <b>wide,</b> <b>flanged</b> heads to act as parachutes to control the direction of their descent, although controlled descent has also been observed in species of Pseudomyrmecinae that have more cylindrical bodies.|$|R
