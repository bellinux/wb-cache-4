5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E

25|$|After a given {{discipline}} {{has changed}} from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a scientific revolution or a paradigm shift. It is often this final conclusion, {{the result of the}} long process, that is meant when the term paradigm shift is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.|$|E

25|$|Assessment of {{homology}} models <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> true target {{structure is}} usually performed with two methods: statistical potentials or physics-based energy calculations. Both methods produce {{an estimate of}} the energy (or an energy-like analog) for the model or models being assessed; independent criteria are needed to determine acceptable cutoffs. Neither of the two methods correlates exceptionally well with true structural accuracy, especially on protein types underrepresented in the PDB, such as membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|According to Denbigh, the {{property}} of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concept of heat. Consideration of hotness leads {{to the concept of}} empirical temperature. All physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others. This does not require that they have thermodynamic temperatures. With reference to hotness, the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder.|$|E
25|$|The terms {{mass and}} nodule {{are often used}} synonymously with tumor. Generally speaking, however, the term tumor is used generically, <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} size of the lesion. More specifically, the term mass is often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters (mm) in greatest direction, while the term nodule is usually used when {{the size of the}} lesion is less than 20mm in its greatest dimension (25.4mm = 1inch).|$|E

25|$|Servius Tullius was {{the legendary}} sixth king of Rome, {{and the second}} of its Etruscan dynasty. He reigned 575–535 BC.

25|$|The 1870s {{was a time}} of rich {{ornamentation}} and eclecticism in the arts. The {{treatment of}} Gothic canopies which were a feature of so many windows began to change from the brightly coloured, two-dimensional, playful appearance of the 1850s and 60s to an appearance of having been carved from fine white limestone. Tudor and Renaissance architectural details made an appearance and were often used <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nature of the real architecture that enclosed the window. The art of painting canopies in this manner was diligently maintained until after World War I.|$|E
25|$|A {{concrete}} category, when defined <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{notion of}} a category, consists of a class of objects, each equipped with an underlying set; and for any two objects A and B a set of functions, called morphisms, from the underlying set of A to the underlying set of B. Furthermore, for every object A, the identity function on the underlying set of A must be a morphism from A to A, and the composition of a morphism from A to B followed by a morphism from B to C must be a morphism from A to C.|$|E

25|$|The {{lines and}} large strokes of color, like words, are treated autonomously—each {{possessing}} an abstract value independent of one another, yet together forming a coherent whole. The impulse toward abstraction becomes a primary quality of Metzinger's work of 1907. Though not <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real world, Metzinger's {{treatment of the}} painted surface is meant to draw away from the outward appearance of nature. Imitation is vacated in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of idea, and represented {{the dominance of the}} artist over the mere stuff of nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} for an Assyrian self-administered zone {{established in the}} environs of Mosul, extending to Dohuk {{in the north and}} Fesh Khabur to the northwest has gained increasing appeal among Assyrian activists, intellectuals, and political leaders. The current political challenges facing Assyrians in the newly developing Iraq include rising Islamic pressure, gross under representation of Assyrians, and a sometimes callous misrepresentation of Assyrians simply as a Christian minority <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Assyrian political, cultural, and nationalist platform. As Mr. Jatou reflected, the increasing Islamic fervor as well as other challenges in Iraq necessitate the establishment of an administrative area for Assyrians and Yezidis.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{one might}} {{like to have a}} direct {{definition}} of the cotangent space <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on M. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point x if they have the same first-order behavior near x, analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions f and g have the same first order behaviour near x if and only if the derivative of the function f-g vanishes at x. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near x.|$|E

25|$|Brisbane {{was doing}} useful work, {{but he could}} not escape the effects of the {{constant}} faction fights which also plagued previous governors. Henry G. Douglass, the assistant-surgeon, was the centre of one of the bitter conflicts. Consequently, charges of various kinds against Brisbane were sent to England. The worst of these, that he had connived at sending female convicts to Emu Plains for immoral purposes, was investigated by William Stewart, the lieutenant-governor, John Stephen, assistant judge, and the Rev. William Cowper, senior assistant-chaplain, and found to be without the slightest foundation. Brisbane discovered that Goulburn, the colonial secretary, had been withholding documents from him and answering some <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governor, and in 1824 reported his conduct to Lord Bathurst. In reply, Bathurst recalled both the governor and the colonial secretary in dispatches dated 29 December 1824.|$|E
25|$|Although extensive, these {{programs}} were often undertaken <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local population {{and it was}} not until 1969 that villagers were involved in determining what projects would be undertaken and in their construction. Equally, ongoing staff and material support was usually not provided, while maintenance and sustainment was the responsibility of the provincial government which often lacked the capacity or the will to provide it, limiting the benefit provided to the local population. The program continued until 1 ATF's withdrawal in 1971, and although it may have succeeded in generating goodwill towards Australian forces, it largely failed to increase support for the South Vietnamese government in the province. Equally, while the program made some useful contributions to the civil facilities and infrastructure in Phuoc Tuy which remained following the Australian departure, it had little impact on the course of the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive neuropsychology is a {{relatively}} new development and has emerged as a distillation of the complementary approaches of both experimental and clinical neuropsychology. It seeks to understand the mind and brain by studying people who have suffered brain injury or neurological illness. One model of neuropsychological functioning is known as functional localization. This is based on the principle that if a specific cognitive problem can be found after an injury to a specific area of the brain, it is possible that this part of the brain is in some way involved. However, there may be {{reason to believe that the}} link between mental functions and neural regions is not so simple. An alternative model of the link between mind and brain, such as parallel processing, may have more explanatory power for the workings and dysfunction of the human brain. Yet another approach investigates how the pattern of errors produced by brain-damaged individuals can constrain our understanding of mental representations and processes <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underlying neural structure. A more recent but related approach is cognitive neuropsychiatry which seeks to understand the normal function of mind and brain by studying psychiatric or mental illness.|$|E
