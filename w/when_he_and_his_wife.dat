He {{retained}} a private pilot's license well into his 80s, eventually quitting flying <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> found it too difficult to get into the cockpit due to knee problems. In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful heart valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. In early December 2016, he was hospitalized at the James Cancer Hospital of Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. According to a family source, Glenn had been in declining health, and his condition was grave; his wife and their children and grandchildren were at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1934, Matthews married Betty Vallance, {{daughter}} of Stoke City trainer Jimmy Vallance, whom he first met on his 15th birthday in 1930 {{on his first day}} as office boy at the Victoria Ground. The couple had two children together: Jean (born 1 January 1939) and Stanley Jr. (born 20 November 1945), who {{went on to become a}} tennis player under the tutelage of John Barrett. He became Wimbledon Boys' Champion in 1962, making him the last English player to do so. He never translated his success into the senior game, though, and instead moved to the United States to run the Four Seasons Racquet Club in Wilton, Connecticut. Jean married Robert Gough, whom she had met at their tennis club. In 1965, Matthews became a grandfather after Jean gave birth to a son, Matthew Gough. She would have two other children — daughters Samantha and Amanda. Gough made Matthews a great-grandfather in 1999 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> had a son, Cameron. Matthews had six other great-grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions {{for a role}} she {{believes}} is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl. At the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition {{for the role of}} the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this is a sign that she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member, thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child.|$|E

He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade. His editors at Putnam then required him to cut its 220,000-word length down to 160,067 words before publication. In 1962, it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E

25|$|Terry Kniess {{holds the}} record for the closest bid on a {{showcase}} without going over, guessing the exact price of the showcase he was given. Kniess, an avid viewer of the show, recorded and watched every episode for four months prior to <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> had tickets to attend in September 2008. Kniess learned that many prizes were repeatedly used (always at the same price) and began taking notes. Kniess was selected as a contestant on September 22, 2008, lost his pricing game (the only contestant to do so that episode), made it to the final showcase and guessed the exact amount of $23,743 for his showcase. Many show staffers, including Carey, were worried that the show was rigged and that Kniess was cheating. Kniess later explained that he had seen all three items of the showcase before and knew the general prices in the thousands. The 743 he used because it was his PIN, based on his wedding date and his wife's birth month.|$|E

500|$|In {{the midst}} of his film career, after Guy Lombardo got him {{interested}} in music, Stuart began his own big band, and became known as [...] "The Man with the Band from Movieland". Stuart had become friendly with Lombardo <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Carol, had helped Lombardo's brother adopt a child in 1932. By 1937, Stuart's band had achieved a modicum of fame, and had appeared in several film shorts, including 1938's Twenty Girls and a Band. After the creation of his band, Stuart would only sporadically appear in films over the next 20 years. In the 1940s, he appeared in two of the Bowery Boys films, starring Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall, Mr. Muggs Steps Out (1943), and Pride of the Bowery (1946). Stuart's last starring role would be in the 1946 film, Gunsmoke.|$|E

500|$|Kurt Cobain wrote [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] {{in early}} 1992. Cobain {{forgot about the}} song for a while, but began working on it again <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Courtney Love, moved to {{a house in the}} Hollywood Hills. In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, [...] " [...] off!" [...] and closed the closet door. [...] "He was trying to be so sneaky", said Love. [...] "I could hear that one from downstairs." [...] The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross noted that Love's songwriting {{sensibility}} informed Cobain's on the song. The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song [...] "Heart-Shaped Coffin".|$|E
500|$|As {{a student}} of the {{classics}} he was passionate about Greece, its mountains and plants (such as Paeonia) and all things Greek, both ancient and modern. The Stearns had formed a friendship with Constantine Goulimis and Niki and Angelos Goulandris, founders of the Goulandris Museum of Natural History [...] in Kifissia, Athens. Stearn first met the Goulandris' in 1967, and offered practical help with their museum. He also stayed with them <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> visited Greece. Niki Goulandris illustrated both Wild Flowers of Greece that Goulimis and Stearn wrote in 1968. as well as his Peonies of Greece (1984). The latter work typified Stearn's encyclopaedic approach, including topics such as mythology and herbalism in addition to taxonomy. Stearn then took on the editorship of Annales Musei Goulandris, the scientific journal of the Museum (1976–1999), succeeding Werner Greuter, the first editor, having been instrumental in getting the journal launched in 1973. Eldwyth Ruth Stearn took on the job of compiling the indexes. When he retired from this position he was 88, and was succeeded by John Akeroyd. He was a liberal contributor to the journal, and during this time he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn undertook their translation of The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature (1993).|$|E
500|$|Storylines for a {{potential}} series had been drafted by writer Mike Bullen during production of the pilot. When production on the series began, producer Christine Langan worked with him to create detailed plots for all six episodes, also acting as a script editor to redraft Bullen's work. Many of the plots were drawn from his own life; Pete and Jenny bringing up their new baby paralleled Bullen and his wife, whose first child was born in late 1997. The scenes where Pete and Jenny attend the antenatal classes were written from Bullen's memory, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> were [...] "given callipers, forceps and a suction cup to play with". The conclusion of the fourth episode, in which Pete's father dies {{on the way to}} his grandson's christening, was suggested by Harries, whose own experience of {{the death of his father}} taught him that people rarely have the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones in real life. Not all storylines were based on real life: For Karen and David's marriage guidance scenes in Episode 5, Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate. Actors and directors also had input into the scripts; Bullen's original script for the marriage therapy scenes ended with David shouting and apparently using a fire extinguisher as an offensive weapon. Bathurst was not convinced that was something that his character would do, as David is [...] "too much of a coward to do anything overtly" [...] and would not leave himself so [...] "exposed": ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "The Rock Show", is the opposite: {{an upbeat}} [...] "effervescent celebration of love, life and music". It was written as a [...] "fast punk-rock love song" [...] in the vein of the Ramones and Screeching Weasel. The song {{tells the story}} of two teenagers meeting a rock concert, and, despite failing grades and disapproving parents, falling and staying in love. It was inspired by the band's early days in San Diego's all-ages venue SOMA. [...] "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] follows and is written about divorce {{from the point of view}} of a helpless child. Inspired by DeLonge's parents' divorce, it is one of the band's darker songs. [...] "Roller Coaster" [...] was written when Hoppus had a nightmare <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Skye, first began dating; the song is about finding something ideal but fearing for its certain departure. [...] "Reckless Abandon" [...] was penned by DeLonge as a reflection on summer memories, including parties, skateboarding and trips to the beach. [...] "Everytime I Look for You" [...] has no specific lyrical basis, according to Hoppus, and [...] "Give Me One Good Reason" [...] was written about punk music and nonconformity in a high school setting. [...] "Shut Up", a [...] "broken-family snapshot", revisits the territory of youthful woes, described by Shooman as a [...] "fairly familiar rites-of-passage tale" [...] that [...] "adds to general themes of isolation, alienation and moving on to a new place that pervade Take Off Your Pants and Jacket". [...] "Please Take Me Home" [...] concludes the standard edition of the album and was written about the consequences of a friendship developing into a relationship.|$|E
500|$|Kim Ki-young's first {{expression}} of his mature style {{was in his}} The Housemaid (1960), which featured a powerful femme fatale character. It is widely considered {{to be one of}} the best Korean films of all time. After a [...] "Golden Age" [...] during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low-point in the history of Korean cinema because of governmental censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as Insect Woman (1972) and Iodo (1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had gone into decline, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s. Widespread international interest in his work was stimulated by a career retrospective at the 1997 Pusan International Film Festival. Kim's films, previously little-known or totally unknown outside South Korea, were shown and gained enthusiastic new audiences in the United States, Germany, France and elsewhere. He was preparing a come-back film <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> were killed in a house fire in 1998. The Berlin International Film Festival gave Kim a posthumous retrospective in 1998, and the French Cinémathèque screened 18 of Kim's films, some newly rediscovered and restored, in 2006. Through the efforts of the Korean Film Council (KOFIC), previously lost films by Kim Ki-young continue to be rediscovered and restored. Many current prominent South Korean filmmakers, including directors Im Sang-soo, Kim Ki-duk, Bong Joon-ho and Park Chan-wook, claim Kim Ki-young as an influence on their careers.|$|E
