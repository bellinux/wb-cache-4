5|$|Her musical {{influences}} {{were better}} expressed on Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, when she considered herself mature {{and was able}} to write and produce songs as she wished, without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the expectations of others. Knowles's lyrics tackle relationships, world issues, and deceased friends, with her second album focusing on events in her life, such as marriage, divorce, and parenthood. The album touched upon a variety of genres including pop-soul, psychedelic soul, electronica, and R.|$|E
5|$|Once in Vanilla Studios, {{the group}} began {{performing}} cover songs {{from a variety}} of genres, such as rockabilly, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and reggae. In contrast to previous rehearsal sessions, the band kept these rehearsals private, and did not allow hangers-on to attend. This seclusion allowed the band to rebuild their confidence without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the reaction from outsiders, who were familiar with the band's punk rock musical style.|$|E

5|$|An EastEnders {{spokesperson}} {{stated that}} programme-makers {{were working in}} close conjunction with the NSPCC in order to portray the subject matter accurately and sensitively, commenting that the show aims {{to raise awareness of}} real-life issues, and has in the past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence, rape and HIV. John Grounds, the NSPCC's director of communications, praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue.

5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> their {{reputation}} and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Instead of <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> a {{possible}} Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal {{purpose of the}} infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not believe any attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing {{to be drawn into}} battles.|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{examined}} (a) {{the demographic}} and clinical correlates of <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia in adult {{family members of}} adults with diabetes, and (b) the association of these worries with measures of diabetes support. Methods: The second multinational Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN 2) study cross-sectionally surveyed 2057 family members from 17 countries. Participants completed questions about demographics, diabetes, and psychosocial functioning, including <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Analyses included hierarchical ordinal and linear regression. Results: Eighty-five percent of family members (n = 1661) were at least occasionally very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the risk of hypoglycemic events overall. Correlates of <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia included female gender, higher age and lower education in the family member, younger age of the person with diabetes and this person being a parent or another adult (versus spouse or partner), insulin or non-insulin injectable treatment, severe or non-severe hypoglycemia in the past 12 months, and family member recognition of hypoglycemia. Elevated <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia had a significant independent association with increased odds of diabetes-related family arguments and family member frustration in providing helpful support (OR range 1. 60 – 3. 72). High levels of <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia were associated with increased odds of attending diabetes-related health-care visits. <b>Worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia were not associated with family member involvement in diabetes care. Similar results were found for <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> nocturnal events. Conclusion: <b>Worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia were common in family members and were associated with suboptimal diabetes support. This issue therefore deserves increased clinician attention...|$|R

5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> {{the technical}} aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E
5|$|At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, {{near the}} end of the Paris sojourn and after two {{successful}} concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers. Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the high costs of living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E

If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Further tragedy soon {{followed}} when Victoria's son, George, died of bone cancer the following year. Her granddaughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, remembered her grandmother's tears.

Her surviving son, Louis, and two of her grandsons served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the opposing forces.

5|$|Johnson {{was known}} for {{fostering}} {{the development of new}} writers without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> maximizing profits, and for printing works on principle, even if he knew they would make little money. His risky publication of Joel Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders (1792), for example, sold 600 copies and barely broke even. He was also instrumental {{in the creation of the}} female professional writer, a role that began opening to women only at the end of the 18th century in Britain. By nurturing the writings of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Mary Hays, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, he gave women the opportunity to demonstrate that they could be both successful and significant authors. Additionally, he published works promoting women's equality, such as Hays's An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain (1798), which called for an end to the tyrannical rule of men over women; Johnson's Analytical Review reviewed the work extensively and approvingly.|$|E

5|$|The major studios, {{at first}} {{resistant}} to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: {{to get access to}} a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.|$|E
40|$|Public insecurities {{about crime}} are widely assumed to erode {{individual}} well-being and community cohesion. Yet, robust {{evidence on the}} link between <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime and health is surprisingly scarce. This paper draws on data from a prospective cohort study (the Whitehall II study) to show a strong statistical effect of mental health and physical functioning on <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime. Combining with existing evidence, we suggest a feedback model in which <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime harms health, which, in turn, serves to heighten <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime. We conclude with the idea that, while fear of crime may express {{a whole set of}} social and political anxieties, there is a core to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime that is implicated in real cycles of decreased health and perceived vulnerability to victimization. The challenge for future study is to integrate core aspects of the everyday experience of fear of crime with the more layered and expressive features of this complex social phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} of <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia with diabetes-specific and typical youth behaviors among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. This study's purpose was to examine the relationship among <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia, diabetes management, and glycemic control within the context of alcohol use, hypoglycemia-related weight control behaviors, depressive symptoms, and impulse control among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample was 181 emerging adults with type 1 diabetes who were part of a larger study. Path analysis was used to test associations among <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia, diabetes management, hypoglycemia-related weight control behaviors (WCB), alcohol use, impulse control, depressive symptoms, and glycemic control. RESULTS: Path model fit and modification indices suggested that a feedback loop between <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia and diabetes management should be incorporated into the original model. Youth with fewer depressive symptoms reported fewer hypoglycemia-related WCB and less <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia; those with higher impulse control had less alcohol use and better diabetes management; those with lower alcohol use had more <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia; and better glycemic control was associated with better diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals need to understand how multiple factors related to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia and diabetes management interact in emerging adults. In the context of depressive symptoms, impulse control, alcohol use, and hypoglycemia-related WCB, the path model results suggest several potential avenues for intervening to improve glycemic control in emerging adults...|$|R
