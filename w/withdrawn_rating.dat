Methods Four hundred and ninety-nine patients with diabetes were invited to complete the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression and the Problem Areas in Diabetes questionnaires. Patients screening positive on either instrument were invited for an interview. One year after screening was <b>withdrawn,</b> <b>rates</b> of referral to psychosocial care were assessed from physician reports of patient referrals. Results In total, 349 / 499 (70 %) patients with diabetes completed the questionnaire. Patients who did not take up the screening were younger, smoked more often and had higher HbA 1 c values. ‘No-shows’ for clinical appointments accounted for 74 % of non-participation. Of the 104 (30 % of 349) patients screening positive, 45 accepted an invitation for an interview. Finally, 36 / 104 (35 %) would like a referral for psychological care. Seven per cent of patients were referred to psychological care during screening compared with 1 % when screening was withdrawn. Conclusions Results raise questions as to whether screening is {{the most efficient way to}} identify patients with psychological problems. Many patients did not take up the screening, especially those with low adherence to diabetes care in general. Furthermore, few patients screening positive wanted to be referred. Screening should be evaluated in the context of consideration of alternative ways to identify at-risk patients, including providing resources to deal with patients with already known adjustment and adherence problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of influence of mould withdrawal rate on the solidification process of CMSX- 4 single crystal castings produced by Bridgman method {{was presented in}} this paper. The predicted values of temperature gradient, solidification and cooling rate, were determined at the longitudinal section of casting blade <b>withdrawn</b> at <b>rate</b> from 1 to 6 mm/min using ProCAST software.

Based on results of solidification parameter G/R (temperature gradient/solidification rate), maximum withdrawal rate of ceramic mould (3. 5 mm/min), which ensures lower susceptibility to formation process of new grain defects in single crystal, was established. It was proved that these defects can be formed in the bottom part of casting at withdrawal rate of 4 mm/min. The increase of withdrawal rate to 5 and 6 mm/min results in additional growth of susceptibility of defects formation along the whole height of airfoil...|$|R

40|$|In {{many areas}} of the western United States {{groundwater}} is being <b>withdrawn</b> at <b>rates</b> far beyond the recharge capacity of the aquifer. The resulting depletion of groundwater supplies is expected to result in a number of adverse social, economic, and environmental consequences. ^ The growing problem of groundwater depletion has intensified the debate over the most appropriate institutional forms needed to manage a common-pool or shared resource like groundwater. In several western states including Nebraska, some resource management authority has been vested with local democratic organizations. Locally controlled resource management systems is a type of common property arrangement that grants a group of users or residents authority to determine who is granted access to the resource and how, when, and where the resource can be used. ^ The overall objective {{of this study is to}} gain a greater understanding of how local, democratic, self-regulation works in the management of a common-pool resource. A conceptual framework is developed from an institutionalist perspective to analyze in a holistic way the causes of the groundwater mining problem, the legal structure authorizing groundwater use and access, the response of a local community to that groundwater depletion problem, and the impact of the local regulatory program on groundwater withdrawals. ^ This framework is then used to analyze and evaluate the groundwater management history of one local resource organization in Nebraska, the Upper Republican Natural Resource District (URNRD). In the case of the URNRD, the groundwater control program has been devised, implemented, financed, and enforced at the local level. The causes and consequences of the rapid development of pump irrigation in the URNRD during the late 1960 s through the 1970 s are explored. The local response to the groundwater depletion problem is then examined. Finally, the impacts of the groundwater control rules on irrigator behavior, per acre groundwater use rates, and total groundwater withdrawals are investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} how understanding teacher’s {{beliefs and}} perceptions about socially withdrawn behaviours offers {{insight into how}} teacher-­‐child relationships may support or harm the child. This study examined teacher perceptions of characteristics such as ‘intelligent’, resilient’ and ‘assertive’, at primary school level by using teacher ratings in response to vignettes describing shy and unsociable children of both genders. Teacher beliefs about the negative costs of socially withdrawn behaviour, and attributions of socially withdrawn behaviour were also explored through teacher ratings, and teacher reported pedagogical practice was investigated through open-­‐ended questions. Ninety seven teachers responded to an online survey. They <b>rated</b> <b>withdrawn</b> children most highly {{on the characteristics of}} intelligent, self-­‐controlled and capable, and least highly on the characteristics of assertive, self-­‐confident and cooperative. This study found that teachers do differentiate between shy and unsociable children, with unsociable children generally viewed more favourably than shy children. Teachers did not distinguish between withdrawn children on the basis of gender, however, interaction effects were also found across a range of characteristics, with a general pattern of less concern for ‘female shy’ and ‘male unsociable’ types. Teachers perceived more negative cost (both academic and social) for the shy type of child. The teachers who answered this survey demonstrated knowledge about ways if assisting socially withdrawn children, although suggestions differed vastly. Recommendations were made that teachers be encouraged to be more aware of the consequences of social withdrawal and of their own responses to socially withdrawn children...|$|R

30|$|At {{the day of}} the PET study, {{catheters}} {{were placed}} in the antecubital vein for tracer injection and in the radial artery for blood sampling. Next, subjects were positioned on the HRRT scanner bed such that the head was {{in the center of the}} field of view. Velcro tapes were used to minimize patient movement during the entire imaging procedure. Lights were dimmed, noise was minimized, and subjects were asked to close their eyes and stay awake during data acquisition. Prior to or immediately after the 15 O]H 2 O scan, a 6 -min singles-based transmission scan with a fan-collimated 137 Cs moving point source was acquired. A 10 -min dynamic emission scan was started 10 s prior to a bolus injection of approximately 800 MBq 15 O]H 2 O. Radioactivity was contained within a volume of approximately 5 mL and was followed by a saline flush to give a total injected volume of 40 mL, administered at a rate of 2 mL/s using an infusion pump (Medrad Inc., Indianola, MS, USA). To allow for radioactive decay of 15 O, the 18 [*]F]FDG scan was acquired after an interval of at least 10 min following the 15 O]H 2 O scan. A 60 -min dynamic emission scan was started 30 s prior to a bolus injection of 186 [*]±[*] 9 MBq 18 [*]F]FDG. The administration protocol was identical to the one used for the 15 O]H 2 O scan. During both emission scans, arterial blood concentrations were monitored continuously using a dedicated on-line blood sampler (Veenstra Instruments, Joure, Netherlands [22]). During the first 4 min of the 15 O]H 2 O scan, blood was <b>withdrawn</b> at a <b>rate</b> of 450 mL/h and activity was read out once per second. For the remaining 6 min, the withdrawal rate was reduced to 150 mL/h and the readout sampling time increased to 10 s. In addition, three manual blood samples were taken at 5, 7.5, and 9 min post-injection. These samples were taken from the same arterial line by briefly interrupting continuous withdrawal. After each sample, the arterial line was flushed with heparinized saline to prevent clotting. Manual samples were used to measure whole blood radioactivity concentrations. The sampling procedure during the 18 [*]F]FDG scan was similar to that of the 15 O]H 2 O scan but with withdrawal rates of 300 mL/h during the first 5 min and 150 mL/h thereafter. During this scan, manual blood samples were taken 15, 35, and 55 min post-injection. These samples were used to measure both whole blood and plasma radioactivity concentrations, as well as arterial plasma glucose levels. This BSIF was used in all analyses except for analyses based on an IDIF.|$|R

Methods Sixty-five ischemic stroke patients combined with OSAS (combined group), 51 ischemic stroke patients without OSAS (ischemic stroke group), and 76 healthy subjects (control group) were enrolled in this study. History of hypertension was inquired, and blood pressure and polysomnography (PSG) were monitored. All antihypertensive drugs were <b>withdrawn.</b> The morbidity <b>rate</b> of hypertension, and levels of pre-sleep and morning blood pressure were assessed. Results The morbidity rate of hypertension and refractory hypertension in combined group and ischemic stroke group were higher than control group (P = 0. 000, 0. 000). The prevalence of simple high systolic blood pressure (SBP) in ischemic stroke group was higher than other 2 groups (P = 0. 000, 0. 002), and the prevalence of simple high diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in combined group was higher than control group and ischemic stroke group (P = 0. 002, 0. 042), while the prevalences of high SBP and DBP in combined group and ischemic stroke group were all higher than control group (P = 0. 000, 0. 045). The prevalence of pre-sleep hypertension and morning hypertension in combined group were all higher than control group (P = 0. 000, 0. 000), and the prevalence of morning hypertension in combined group was also higher than ischemic stroke group (P = 0. 000), while only the prevalence of pre-sleep hypertension in ischemic stroke group was higher than control group (P = 0. 002). The difference of prevalence of pre-sleep hypertension between combined group and ischemic stroke group {{was not statistically significant}} (P = 0. 347). The pre-sleep SBP (P = 0. 000, 0. 020) and morning SBP (P = 0. 000, 0. 004) in combined group and ischemic stroke group were all higher than control group, but the difference between combined group and ischemic stroke group was not statistically significant (P = 0. 074, 0. 100); the pre-sleep DBP (P = 0. 000, 0. 000) and morning DBP (P = 0. 000, 0. 000) in combined group were higher than the ischemic stroke group and control group, but the difference of pre-sleep DBP and morning DBP between ischemic stroke group and control group was not statistically significant (P = 0. 059, 0. 054). The differences of pre?sleep SBP and morning SBP in combined group, ischemic stroke group and control group were not statistically significant (P = 0. 702, 0. 329, 0. 503), but the difference of pre-sleep DBP and morning DBP in combined group was statistically significant (P = 0. 000), while the differences of pre-sleep DBP and morning DBP in ischemic stroke group and control group were not statistically significant (P = 0. 058, 0. 318). Conclusion Isolated systolic hypertension is the main manifestation of ischemic stroke patient.
