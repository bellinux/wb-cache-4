[Purpose] The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the accuracy of a digital <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> rela-tive to the Wii in limb loading measurement during static standing. [Methods] This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a public university teaching hospital. The sample consisted of 24 participants (12 with osteoarthritis and 12 healthy) recruited through convenient sampling. Limb loading measurements were obtained using a digi-tal <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> and the Nintendo Wii in static standing with three trials under an eyes-open condition. The limb load asymmetry was computed as the symmetry index. [Results] The accuracy of measurement with the digital <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> relative to the Nintendo Wii was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test). The area under the ROC curve was found to be 0. 67. Logistic regression con-firmed the validity of digital <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> relative to the Nintendo Wii. The D statistics value from the K-S test was found to be 0. 16, which confirmed that there was no significant difference in measurement between the equipment. [Conclusion] The digital <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> is an accurate tool for measuring limb load asymmetry. The low price, easy availability, and maneuverability make it a good potential tool in clinical settings for measuring limb load asym-metry...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{bathroom}} {{scales are}} an easy-to-use, affordable mean to measure physiological parameters {{in addition to}} body weight. They have been proposed to obtain the ballistocardiogram (BCG) and derive from it the heart rate, cardiac output and systolic blood pressure. Therefore, weighing scales may suit intermittent monitoring in e-health and patient screening. Scales intended for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) have also been proposed to estimate the heart rate by amplifying the pulsatile impedance component superimposed on the basal impedance. However, electronic weighing scales cannot easily obtain the BCG from people that have a single leg neither are bioimpedance measurements between both feet recommended for people wearing a pacemaker or other electronic implants, neither for pregnant women. We propose a method to detect the heart rate (HR) from bioimpedance measured in a single foot while standing on an bathroom <b>weighting</b> <b>scale</b> intended for BIA. The electrodes built in the weighing scale are used to apply a 50 kHz voltage between the outer electrode pair and to measure the drop in voltage across the inner electrode pair. The agreement with the HR simultaneously obtained from the ECG is excellent. We have also compared the drop in voltage across the waist and the thorax with that obtained when measuring bioimpedance between both feet to compare the possible risk of the proposed method to that of existing BIA scales.

Individual patients were considered exposed to intravenous insulin or glucose when this was registered in the electronic patient data management system (PDMS, Meta Vision, iMD-Soft, Tel Aviv, Israel). Daily intravenous insulin dosage was calculated based on the hourly drip rate. All beds are equipped with a <b>weighting</b> <b>scale,</b> which {{was used for the}} bodyweight adjusted insulin dosage. Individual patients were considered exposed to intravenous glucose when they received glucose infusion in any form of glucose (in our ICU either glucose 5 % or 20 %). Daily intravenous glucose dosage was calculated in grams by summation of all glucose infusions (e.g., glucose 5 % contains 50  mg/mL; and glucose 20 % contains 200  mg/mL). In general, glucose 5 % is used as volume resuscitation only when patients suffer from hypernatremia, or to dissolve certain medication. In other cases, volume resuscitation or maintenance was achieved with sodium chloride solutions. Glucose 20 % is mainly administered as part of total parenteral feeding (TPV) or to treat hypoglycemia. Since there is a substantial difference in the net uptake of enteral glucose among individuals, and since plasma glucose is mainly dependent on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, we did not take account of enteral feeding in the total amount of intravenous infused glucose. Outcomes of interest were all-cause ICU and hospital mortality. We followed patients until death or discharge from the ICU or the hospital.|$|E
