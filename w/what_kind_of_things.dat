A packet of pudding, a steam-gauge, a tin of cream, a bird's wing, a musical box, packet of snowdrops, fruit sweets, shrimps, and sample potatoes; a dormouse, four white mice, two goldfinches, a lizard and a blind-worm, all alive; besides cutlery, medicines, varnish, ointments, perfumery, articles of dress; a stoat, a squirrel, fish, leeches, frogs, beetles, caterpillars, and vegetables. Of course, many of these, such as live animals, being prohibited articles, were stopped and sent to the Returned Letter Office, but were restored, on application, to the senders." ...|$|E
60|$|But such a {{house as}} his would be, as he knew, but a poor {{residence}} for his wife's nieces. Indeed, without positively {{saying that he}} was unwilling to receive them, he had, when he first heard of the breaking up of the house in Curzon Street, shewn that he would rather not take upon his shoulders so great a responsibility. He and his wife had discussed the matter between them, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} they did not know <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> might have been done in Curzon Street. They would think no evil, they said; but the very idea of a married woman with a lover was dreadful to them. It might be that their niece was free from blame. They hoped so. And even though her sin had been of ever so deep a dye, they would take her in,--if it were indeed necessary. But they hoped that such help from them might not be needed. They both knew how to give counsel to a poor woman, how to rebuke a poor man,--how to comfort, encourage, or to upbraid the poor. Practice had told them how far they might go with some hope of doing good;--and at what stage of demoralisation no good from their hands was any longer within the scope of fair expectation. But all this was among the poor. With what words to encourage such a one as their niece Mrs. Trevelyan,--to encourage her or to rebuke her, as her conduct might seem to make necessary,--they both felt that they were altogether ignorant. To them Mrs. Trevelyan was a fine lady. To Mr. Outhouse, Sir Marmaduke had ever been a fine gentleman, given much to worldly things, who cared more for whist and a glass of wine than for anything else, and who thought that he had a good excuse for never going to church in England because he was called upon, as he said, to show himself in the governor's pew always once on Sundays, and frequently twice, when he was at the seat of his government. Sir Marmaduke manifestly looked upon church as a thing in itself notoriously disagreeable. To Mr. Outhouse it afforded the great events of the week. And Mrs. Outhouse would declare that to hear her husband preach was the greatest joy of her life. It may be understood therefore that though the family connection between the Rowleys and the Outhouses had been kept up with a semblance of affection, it had never blossomed forth into cordial friendship.|$|E

50|$|If one accepts {{that nothing}} is known until learned, and that {{everyone}} shares a basic common sense, it appears infants must—to some degree—make some specific ontological inferences about how the world works, and <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> it contains.

50|$|Mackie is {{best known}} for his {{contributions}} to the fields of meta-ethics, philosophy of religion, and metaphysics. In meta-ethics, he took a position called moral scepticism, arguing against the objective existence of right and wrong as intrinsically normative entities on fundamental grounds as unsure about <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> such entities would be, if they existed.|$|R
5000|$|Animal Crossing series {{producer}} Aya Kyogoku {{explained that}} Happy Home Designer {{was inspired by}} the internal process of designing homes for the animal villagers in the main Animal Crossing games, stating that [...] "We had to think about, <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> would this animal like? What kind of life do they lead? Trying to figure out what they'd want was very fun, and we tried to think of a way we could get this kind of experience to players as well." [...] Players are not tied to a specific budget when designing homes; while the concept was considered, the development team believed that such a limit placed too much of a burden on the player's creativity.|$|E
50|$|Socrates inserts {{himself into}} the quarrel. When he begins by {{questioning}} the musical rival's claim to know what philosophizing is, he gets the answer that philosophy is polymathy. With {{the help of the}} athletic rival, who knows that the good of exercise depends on being done in the right amount (not the maximum amount), Socrates points out that {{the same is true of}} most good things, and turns to asking <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> the one who philosophizes (loves wisdom) ought to learn, if the object is not simply to know all or many things (135a). The musical rival suggests that the philosopher, while not needing to bother himself with the hands-on practicalities (cheirourgia, 135b), should aspire to a level of understanding in all the arts (technai) such that he is second only to the expert in that particular field—still a kind of polymathy. Socrates challenges this suggestion by forcing the would-be philosopher to admit that, in any conceivable particular circumstance, the philosopher would be useless in comparison to a true expert on the matter (e.g., a physician or a ship's pilot).|$|E
5000|$|In a 2003 interview, Dale {{explained}} that he had “always been interested in using quantitative modeling methods and simulations to answer biological questions,” and that as a Harvard student he had been “interested in approaching connectionist neural networks from a more biological angle.” When he went to UCSD to continue his graduate work his interest “shifted to learning how to test models of how the brain works. Ideally you'd like to test your models not in anesthetized animals and brain slices, but by measuring brain activity in humans non-invasively. I wanted to study normal people doing normal tasks. That was what brought me to imaging. My goal was to see <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> we can measure non-invasively that can be quantitatively related to the models we want to build....I {{wanted to know what}} exactly we are measuring, how can you model it, and how can you relate the signal to {{what is going on in}} the brain physiologically...at a level that say you could measure invasively and that you could relate to parameters of quantitative models.” His thesis work at UCSD, he said, “was on the EEG and MEG forward and inverse problems, and how to use anatomical information to constrain the solutions. It is clear that if you only use EEG or MEG measures, the spatial precision is not good enough to make inferences at a scale that's most useful to neuroscience. That led us into trying to use information with higher spatial resolution to constrain or bias our estimations of the signal sources in the brain.” ...|$|E

The sons of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatimah Zahra are worthy and outstanding only when they obey the command of Allah, and keep themselves away from sin and blunder. You think you are like Musa al-Kadhim, Ali ibn Husayn, and other Imams? Whereas, they took pains and bore hardships on the way to Allah and prayed to Allah day and night. Do you think you will gain without pain? Be aware, that if a person out of us the Ahl al-Bayt performs a good deed, he gets twice the reward. Because not only he performed good deeds like others but also that he has maintained the honor of Muhammad. If he practices something bad and does a sin, he has performed two sins. One is that he performed a bad act {{like the rest of the}} people and the other one is that he has negated the honor of Muhammad. O brother! The one who obeys Allah is from us the Ahl al-Bayt and the one who is a sinner is not ours. Allah said about the son of Noah who cut the spiritual bondage with his father, [...] "He is not out of your lineage; if he was out of your lineage, I would have (saved) and granted him salvation." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an experimental}} software project that interactively trains an artificial intelligence program with user input. The {{project is a}} commentary on the human-machine relationship inspired by the infamous Turing 'imitation ' game. The software is an anthropomorphic play modeled on the different stages of an initiation rite (separation, margin and aggregation) observed by Van Gennep in early African societies. We ask users {{to interact with the}} software in order to teach it what is needed to become intelligent. The users reply to a series of questions such as: <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> should an intelligent machine have, <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> should intelligent machines know about, and so on. By comparing and contrasting the answers given by different participants, we identify the underlying assumptions, desires, and expectations projected onto the attempts to build artificial agency. By pointing out a series of similarities between the birth of agency in human infancy and the processes for building human-like intelligent machinery, we comment on how the perception of intelligent machines and newborns are configured by the established norms and values in society...|$|E

40|$|When {{children}} ask, "What is it? " {{are they}} seeking {{information about what}} something is called or <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> it is? To find out, we gave 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -year-olds (32 at each age) the opportunity to inquire about unfamiliar artifacts. An ambiguous question was answered with a name or with functional information, depending on the group to which the children were assigned. Children were inclined to follow up with additional questions about the object when they had been told its name, but seemed satisfied with the answer when they had been told the object's function. Moreover, children in the name condition tended to substitute questions about function for ambiguous questions {{over the course of}} the session. These results indicate that children are motivated to discover <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> novel artifacts are, and that young children, like adults, conceive <b>of</b> artifact <b>kinds</b> in terms <b>of</b> their functions. The questions that children address to other people who are more expert than they are surely serve as an important way for them to gain knowledge. Yet the questions children ask have received relatively little systematic research attention. The current study focused on the inquiries that young children make about artifacts, the human-made objects that pervade our species...|$|R
