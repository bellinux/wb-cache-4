I don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean,</b> or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

500|$|From {{early in}} his England career, D'Oliveira and his {{supporters}} saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career. Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: [...] "Nobody could be in any doubt {{that the possibility of}} D'Oliveira being chosen {{as a member of the}} England touring party would raise massive political complications". When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a [...] coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> to the non-white people of South Africa. In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply [...] "agreed to hope that the whole issue went away".|$|E

2500|$|The Russian {{campaign}} {{revealed that}} Napoleon was not invincible, decreasing {{his reputation as}} a military genius. [...] Napoleon made many terrible errors in this campaign, the worst of which was to undertake it in the first place. [...] The conflict in Spain was an additional drain on resources and made it more difficult to recover from the retreat. F. G. Hourtoulle wrote [...] "One does not make war on two fronts, especially so far apart". In trying to have both he gave up any chance of success at either. [...] Napoleon had foreseen <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean,</b> so he fled back to France quickly before word of the disaster became widespread, allowing him to start raising another army. [...] Following the campaign Metternich began to take the actions that would take Austria out of the war with a secret truce. Sensing this and urged on by Prussian nationalists and Russian commanders, German nationalists revolted in the Confederation of the Rhine and Prussia. The decisive German campaign might not have occurred without the defeat in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting {{the modern}} {{position}} since unfair terms legislation was enacted, the most quoted passage in English courts on the canons of interpretation {{is found in}} Lord Hoffmann's judgment in ICS Ltd v West Bromwich BS. Lord Hoffmann restated the law that a document's meaning is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> (1) to a reasonable person (2) {{with knowledge of the}} context, or the whole matrix of fact (3) except prior negotiations (4) and meaning does not follow what the dictionary says but meaning understood from its context (5) and the meaning should not contradict common sense. The objective is always to give effect to the intentions of the parties. While it remains the law for reasons of litigation cost, there is some contention over how far evidence of prior negotiations should be excluded by the courts. It appears increasingly clear that the courts may adduce evidence of negotiations where it would clearly assist in construing the meaning of an agreement. This approach to interpretation has some overlap with the right of the parties to seek [...] "rectification" [...] of a document, or requesting from a court to read a document not literally but with regard to what the parties can otherwise show was really intended.|$|E
2500|$|While at Fort Myer, Virginia Emory {{acted as}} a {{correspondent}} for the Baltimore Sun. His series of five articles, entitled [...] "Reports from a Rookie" [...] and carrying his byline, appeared {{from time to time in}} the Sun, and explained many details of camp life and the rigors of military training of the day. In his first such report, published on May 20, 1917, Emory wrote, [...] "One coming to camp is struck, instantly, by the type of men Uncle Sam has taken under his care for the next three months, and to whom he will entrust the training of the first army of 500,000. There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations. Many of the men are married and many were doing well in civil life before coming here. They fully appreciated <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> for a man to leave his family, friends and business for an indefinite period, and it makes a fellow feel proud of being an American when he glances about and thinks for a moment of the sacrifices voluntarily assumed by the 2,500 men here and the 38,000 men at the other training camps." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} decades have {{witnessed}} the growth of an exciting debate in the legal academy about the tensions between economic pressures to commodify and philosophical commitments to the market inalienability of certain items.

Lack, in these terms, could be constitutive rather than a mere marker of absence. I propose that the place of bees in the symbolics of species could yield answers to these and related questions. Insects are often understood and conceived as communicators – through pheromones for instance. But in the very gesture that recognizes their communication, one finds the refusal of consciousness behind this communicative apparatus. If bees are said to lack consciousness, bees nonetheless matter. But what place will bees have as they face extinction? Amidst much else, bees are a medium of pollination for human agriculture. In that sense, bees are a matrix for the very sustenance of the human species: a place for humans. In China, honeybee death {{has led to the}} need for human workers to pollinate crops by hand (Goulson). The possible extinction of the honeybee is a potentially devastating effect of the anthropocene. We are tied to bees as long as we are tied to crops and agriculture, {{but this is not the}} sole reason to care about bees...|$|R

40|$|Harm-reduction {{approaches}} {{are used to}} reduce the burden of risky human behaviour without necessarily aiming to stop the behaviour. We discuss what an introduction of harm reduction for doping in sports <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> in parallel with a relaxation of the antidoping rule. We analyse what is ethically {{at stake in the}} following five levels: (1) <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> for the athlete (the self) ? (2) How <b>would</b> <b>it</b> impact other athletes (the other) ? (3) How <b>would</b> <b>it</b> affect the phenomenon of sport as a game and its fair play basis (the play) ? (4) What would be the consequences for the spectator and the role of sports in society (the display) ? and (5) <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> for <b>what</b> some consider as essential to being human (humanity) ? For each level, we present arguments for and against doping and then discuss what a harm-reduction approach, within a dynamic regime of a partially relaxed antidoping rule, could imply. We find that a harm-reduction approach is morally defensible and potentially provides a viable escape out of the impasse resulting from the impossibility of attaining the eradication of doping. The following question remains to be answered: Would a more relaxed position, when combined with harm-reduction measures, indeed have less negative consequences for society than today's all-out antidoping efforts that aim for abstinence? We provide an outline of an alternative policy, allowing a cautious step-wise change to answer this question and then discuss the ethical aspects of such a policy change...|$|R
