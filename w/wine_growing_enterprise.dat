5000|$|The {{wine grape}} assortments of Romanian <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> regions {{encompasses}} {{a large number}} of varieties for white, red and aromatic <b>wines.</b> Each <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region has its own, traditional varieties, as: Zghihara de Huși and Busuioaca de Bohotin for the Huși <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region; Feteasca neagră for the Iași <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region; Grasa de Cotnari and Frâncușa for the Cotnari <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region; Crâmpoșie for the Drăgășani <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region; Băbeasca Neagră for the Nicorești <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region; Iordană și Ardeleancă for the Târnave; or Mustoasă de Măderat for the Miniș <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region. Also, each <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> region cultivate international wine grape varieties, mainly: Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Riesling italico, Pinot gris and Traminer for white wines; and Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot noir for red wines. All these local and international varieties are at the basis of {{a large number of}} wines, presented mainly under the name of the wine grape variety (e.g. Sauvignon, Feteasca albă, Tămâioasă românească) and less under the name of producer (e.g. DAVINO, ALIRA, LACERTA), or under a marketing name (e.g. Serafim, Bon Viveur, Gramma, René Faure etc.).|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) My {{starting}} point for this thesis was {{the absence of a}} foundation history of Australian <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> conducted by an historian rather than researchers in other disciplines or the media. I have used existing work on wine history in New South Wales from 1788 to 1901 alongside a significant body of new research to create an historical argument suitable for incorporation into more broadly-themed narratives of Australian history and to inform studies of <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> in other academic fields. My main argument is that although <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> proved of little economic value in colonial primary production compared with nation-building commodities - such as pastoralism, wheat growing and gold - advocates of the cultivation of wine grapes believed <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> embodied beneficial, even transformative, cultural value so they persisted in attempting to create a ‘civilizing’ industry producing a ‘civilized’ drink despite lacklustre consumption of their product and very modest profits. Several times, from 1788 to 1901, these advocates spoke out or wrote about <b>wine</b> and <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> as capable of creating order in a wild or ‘savage’ landscape and within a settler society shaped culturally by shifting adaptations to both imported and ‘native’ influences in agriculture as well as alcohol production, consumption and distribution. While the methodological framework employed here falls mainly within cultural and economic history, sociological theories have contributed to findings on causation. The result is a comprehensive narrative of colonial <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> in New South Wales enriched by links to key developments in Australian colonial history and with reference to <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> in other British colonies or former territories...|$|R
