2500|$|Some counterfeits are of poor quality, with {{obviously}} visible differences [...] (less sharply defined, lacking intricate details, edge milling and markings visibly wrong). Many better counterfeits can {{be detected}} by comparing {{the orientation of the}} obverse and reverseâ€”they always match in genuine coins, but very often not in counterfeits. The design on the reverse must be correct for the stamped year (e.g., a 1996 coin should have a Celtic cross). It is difficult to manufacture coins with properly-produced edges; the milling (grooves) may be incomplete or poor and the inscription (often [...] "DECUS ET TUTAMEN") may be poorly produced and sometimes in the <b>wrong</b> <b>typeface.</b> A shiny coin with less wear than its date suggests is also suspect, although it may be a genuine coin that has rarely been used.|$|E
