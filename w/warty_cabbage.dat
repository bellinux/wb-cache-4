50|$|Bunias is a genus in the Brassicaceae family. The genus {{includes}} {{only two}} accepted species, Bunias erucago (crested <b>warty</b> <b>cabbage,</b> corn rocket) and Bunias orientalis (Turkish rocket, hill mustard, Turkish <b>warty</b> <b>cabbage,</b> <b>warty</b> <b>cabbage).</b>|$|E
40|$|We studied genetic {{diversity}} within and among populations of <b>warty</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Bunias orientalis L.), {{which is an}} alien species in Lithuania and other Baltic countries. In Lithuania, this weed colonises two main types of habitats: railway/roadsides and meadows on riversides. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the genetic structure of invasive populations of B. orientalis in Lithuania and consider the impact of diverse habitats on the partitioning of {{genetic diversity}} using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) carried out on the basis of ISSR showed that there is high genetic differentiation (46 %) among populations of B. orientalis, which is probably caused by the founder effect and limited gene flow. However, we observed no impact of habitat on the genetic difference among populations. Similar levels of ISSR polymorphic loci were observed in riverside (P = 31. 67 %) and railway/roadsides (P = 30. 51 %) populations. UPGMA cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) also did not show grouping of studied populations according to habitat type. High genetic differentiation among populations, as indicated by ISSR markers, confirm multiple independent introductions of this species in Lithuania...|$|E
40|$|The <b>warty</b> <b>cabbage</b> Bunias orientalis is an {{invasive}} pest in much {{of central}} Europe, including much of Germany since the 1980 s, whereas in other countries, such as The Netherlands, it is a less common exotic species. Here, healthy larvae of Mamestra brassicae, which has been found feeding on B. orientalis plants in Germany, and larvae parasitized by one of its major larval endoparasitoids Microplitis mediator, were reared on both herbivoreinduced and noninduced leaves of B. orientalis originating from single large populations growing in The Netherlands and central Germany. Herbivore performance was less negatively affected than parasitoid performance by differences in plant quality. Development times in both M. brassicae and Mi. mediator were shorter on Dutch than German plants and also shorter on noninduced than induced plants. Moreover, survival and body size of the parasitoid was more strongly affected by plant population and induction than survival of healthy M. brassicae. Chemical analyses of defensive secondary metabolites [glucosinolates (GS) ] revealed that concentrations of the major GS sinalbin were constitutively expressed in German plants whereas they were induced in Dutch plants. However, in separate feeding bioassays in which preference for induced and noninduced leaves was compared separately, L 3 instars of M. brassicae preferred noninduced German plants over Dutch plants but induced Dutch plants over German plants, revealing that changes in primary metabolites or an unidentified non-GS compound mediates population- related differences in plant quality. The results reveal asymmetric effects of plant quality in exotic plants on organisms {{in the second and}} third trophic level. ...|$|E
40|$|Alien {{species are}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} greatest drivers of biodiversity loss. In Norway <b>Warty</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Bunias orientalis L.) is considered to be a species that has a negative impact on indigenous biological diversity. In order to eradicate an unwanted plant species as efficiently as possible it is important to take action at the stage where it is at its weakest and most vulnerable. Perennial vascular plants are weakest and prone to damage at the point in their seasonal life cycle where they have a minimum of energy stored in their below ground plant parts, called the compensation point. In this thesis I have been studying plants of B. orientalis in order to locate a possible dry-weight minimum in the below ground plant parts, the transport direction of carbohydrate reserves by using 14 C, the taproot’s ability to produce aerial shoots from adventitious buds and the time of seed ripening. The experiments were carried out from September 2009 to March 2011, and the studies were done on both young (1 - 2 years old) transplanted plants at Ås and on older plants sampled directly from a B. orientalis population along the E 6 in Oslo. In young plants (1 - 2 years old) of B. orientalis no dry-weight minimum of the below ground plant parts was found at any specific development stage, but from the isotope experiment changes in the transport direction of carbohydrate reserves were detected. At the stage where the smallest proportion of 14 C was located in the roots, might be the stage where the source-sink dynamic of carbohydrate reserves shifts from the below ground plant parts being the source to being the sink, and a weak point in the species seasonal life cycle. At this point plants in their generative stage had started stem elongation and had an average height of 31 cm and inflorescence with the first individual flowers visible, but still closed. The vegetative plants had medium sized rosette with an average rosette height of 28 cm and an average diameter of 39 cm. The young plants at Ås did not show a defined drop in their regenerative capacity from root sections at any point, but for the older plants a minimum of regenerative capacity from root sections was found at the stage where the plants had started to elongate and had an average height of 26 cm and visible inflorescence. This development stage corresponds well with the development stage found in the isotope experiment where an indication of a weak point was found. In order to find the time of seed ripening, seeds were harvested from the roadside population in Oslo on the 6 th and 20 th July and on the 3 rd and 17 th of August. The seeds harvested in the beginning of July did not manage to germinate, while the seeds had reached maturity in the second half of July. B. orientalis is an extremely vigorous plant with a powerful taproot which make weed control difficult, and it is therefore of great importance to monitor this species and to take action against new occurrences as soon as they are detected...|$|E
