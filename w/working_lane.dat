40|$|In {{cities where}} their scarce land {{supplies}} have {{to accommodate the}} gigantic capacities of port container terminals, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the containers to be loaded onto the same vessel are usually stacked together to form tall stacked blocks. In most container yards, only one <b>working</b> <b>lane</b> adjacent to each yard block is available for the empty trucks to queue up to receive the export containers. When loading activities start, {{a large number of}} trucks flock to the loading yard blocks containing a huge number of export containers, thus jamming the <b>working</b> <b>lane.</b> This paper considers the problem of determining the sequence of trucks entering the <b>working</b> <b>lane</b> that minimizes the total time required to serve all the empty trucks dispatching to a loading yard block. An algorithm with easy implementation is developed to find the optimal sequence easily. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

5000|$|Married to Xavier Cugat from 1952 {{until their}} divorce in 1964, Lane {{achieved}} her greatest {{success as a}} nightclub singer, and was described in a 1963 magazine article as [...] "the swingingest sexpot in show business." [...] Cugat's influence was seen in her music which favoured Latin and rumba styles. In 1958 she starred opposite Tony Randall in the Broadway musical Oh, Captain!, but her recording contract prevented her from appearing on the original cast album of the show. Eileen Rodgers performed her songs for the cast LP; Lane later recorded her songs on a solo album. She made several recordings for RCA Victor and Mercury Records. The most successful of her albums was a collaboration with Tito Puente titled Be Mine Tonight released in 1958. Apart from <b>working</b> solo, <b>Lane</b> frequently appeared on talk shows with Cugat until 1963. She attracted attention for her suggestive comments such as [...] "Jayne Mansfield may turn boys into men, but I take them from there", and also commented that she was considered [...] "too sexy in Italy". Her costume for an appearance on the Jackie Gleason Show was considered too revealing and she was instructed to wear something else. She appeared on the shows of Red Skelton, Dean Martin and Jack Benny without attracting controversy, however.|$|R

50|$|Lawvere {{completed}} his Ph.D at Columbia in 1963 with Eilenberg. His dissertation introduced the Category of Categories {{as a framework}} for the semantics of algebraic theories.

He then taught at the University of Chicago, <b>working</b> with Mac <b>Lane,</b> and at the City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY), working with Alex Heller. His Chicago lectures on categorical dynamics were a further step toward topos theory and his CUNY lectures on hyperdoctrines advanced categorical logic especially using his 1963 discovery that existential and universal quantifiers can be characterized as special cases of adjoint functors.|$|R

500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Taylor was {{considered}} a better hockey player than cricketer. When she began playing for Thames Valley, she {{was considered a}} wicket-keeper {{with no more than}} average batting ability. At university, she began to develop her batting, playing alongside the men for her college side. The different pace and strength required in the men's game meant that she had to learn to play off the back foot, in contrast to women's cricket, which is generally played off the front foot. After graduating from university in 1997, she made her international debut for England in 1998, but batted low in the order for England, having been picked as a wicket-keeper. Intent on improving her batting, she began one-on-one coaching with Mark Lane. At the time, it was unusual for a member of the England women's team to have individual coaching sessions, and Taylor had to pay for the meetings herself. When they began <b>working</b> together, <b>Lane</b> was critical of her batting; [...] "She was just average, I would say." [...] The sessions helped to improve Taylor's mental approach towards batting as well as making technical changes, though Lane promoted the use of bottom-handed hockey-style shots which came more naturally to Taylor. At her peak, she used her intelligence to help manipulate the field; in an interview she described that, [...] "when I'm batting at my best I have a 3D awareness of the shape of the field and where the spaces are." ...|$|R

Another anomalous left turn at a level crossing sets the path for Caersws, Carno and Llanbrynmair.

30|$|In {{aptitude}} diagnostic practice, simulation-based {{testing is}} used, {{in which people}} are supposed to describe their fictional behavior in certain typical situations, so-called Situational Judgment Tests (SJT) (Ployhart and MacKenzie 2011). In comparison to role-plays, questions can be focused in detail on different competence dimensions, allowing the identification of structures and levels, while the observation of the act itself would only show the resulting conglomerate of the dimensions <b>working</b> together (<b>Lane</b> and Rollnick 2007). SJTs are mostly used in the selection of executives and designed to fit specific professional positions, which is why specific procedures need to be developed for each context of requirements. One such context is the occupation itself. Based on a requirements analysis to determine the work tasks, interactions and tools composing the occupation one could imagine defining tasks that can display the participants social competences in the specific context of their work. Tschöpe (unpublished manuscript 2012) for example has developed an SJT for the measurement of counseling skills among bankers, containing social competences as a major pluri-factoral component. In this paper we want to present an SJT related to the work of Tschöpe (unpublished manuscript 2012) in the medical field, more specifically for medical assistants in Germany. The project, called Competence Measurement based on Simulations and adaptive Testing in Medical Settings (CoSMed), was funded through the ASCOT (technology orientated competence measurement in vocational education and training) research initiative by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The overall CoSMed project develops computer-based test procedures on a collaborative basis for measuring the occupational competences of medical assistants. In this paper, only the aspect of social competences will be treated but compared with the other findings in the end.|$|R

Anita struggles to get by and her benefactor George Ferguson controls her. Tracy is attacked and nearly killed by her pimp Dez (Ashan Bhatti), but she recovers and her parents take her home. She is unable to stand living under their rules. Tracy's father abused her, she is not sure that her mother believes her, and her sister is resentful towards her for leaving home because her parents argued a lot since Tracy left. As a result, Tracy runs away from home again. Tracy and Rose travel to London where Tracy continues her street-walking profession and Rose tries to go straight by going to college and meets a man, Richard, for whom she starts to have feelings. Tracy puts one of her calling cards in Richard's pocket; Richard phones and asks for two girls. Thinking that Rose will come with Tracy, he arranges to meet her.
