5000|$|The act {{allows the}} Senate {{to confirm or}} reject people whom the {{president}} never officially nominated. The act allows the Senate to treat a president's <b>written</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> intent to nominate as a nomination, {{despite the fact that}} the president has yet to and may never nominate the named individual to an advice and consent position. Such treatment <b>of</b> a president's <b>written</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> intent to nominate violates both the “formalist” and “functionalist” Supreme Court decisions on federal appointment issues.|$|R

Concerns that the threats <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> made by Burundi, Gambia and South Africa in late 2016 would produce a domino effect, and even become the harbinger of the ICC’s demise in the long term, have proven premature. This development should, however, not make us complacent about the challenges the ICC continues to face, {{even in the absence}} <b>of</b> further state <b>withdrawals...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} reading debate, {{one of the}} cross bench peers, Lord Hope, {{who had been a}} Supreme Court Justice from 2009 until his {{retirement}} in 2013, mentioned that the wording of the bill sufficed for giving <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> as the Supreme Court’s decision in the Miller case required, but it said nothing about the process of the two further stages stated in article 50: negotiation, and the concluding of an agreement between the Union and the state that was withdrawing.|$|R

5000|$|Powell {{also argued}} that the {{safeguards}} provided by the Ohio statute were sufficient. The statute required the student's parents and the Board of Education to be given <b>written</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the suspension and [...] "reasons therefor" [...] within 24 hours. Powell {{also argued that}} the informal hearing proposed by the majority would not provide significantly more protection.|$|R
5000|$|Although these exports were {{sales by}} Canadian companies, not gifts from the Canadian government, they benefited the American war effort nonetheless. The first {{official}} {{response to the}} economic support being given to the United States military from the government was by Lester B. Pearson on March 10, 1967 that the export of goods to their southern ally was [...] "necessary and logical" [...] due to the extreme integration of both economies, and that an embargo {{would also be a}} <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from North American defense arrangements.|$|R

This policy was the government strategy {{not only in the}} Marshall Islands, but on all the other mandated territories in Micronesia. On March 27, 1933, Japan gave <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the League of Nations, but continued to manage the islands, and in the late 1930s began building air bases on several atolls. The Marshall Islands were in an important geographic position, being the easternmost point in Japan's defensive ring at the beginning of World War II.|$|R
50|$|North Korea {{ratified}} the treaty on 12 December 1985, but gave <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the treaty on 10 January 2003 following U.S. allegations {{that it had}} started an illegal enriched uranium weapons program, and the U.S. subsequently stopping fuel oil shipments under the Agreed Framework which had resolved plutonium weapons issues in 1994. The withdrawal became effective 10 April 2003 making North Korea the first state ever {{to withdraw from the}} treaty. North Korea had once before announced withdrawal, on 12 March 1993, but suspended that notice before it came into effect.|$|R

50|$|The Collective Redundancy (Notification) Act of 1976 imposed an {{obligation}} on employers (who intend to collectively dismiss employees) “to give <b>written</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> this intention to the relevant trade unions for consultation,” while {{that same year}} consultative works councils were replaced by powerful ones modelled after the German works councils. Also in 1976, a law was passed forbidding dismissal upon pregnancy or marriage for all women.|$|R
5000|$|The Boards of Appeal {{have dealt}} {{in a great}} number of {{decisions}} with the question <b>of</b> whether the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> a European patent application can be retracted, because it was made erroneously. In particular, the Boards have held that the [...] "withdrawal of a European patent application can only be retracted as long as the public has not been officially informed about the withdrawal". In other words, in the interests of legal certainty, it is generally too late to request retraction <b>of</b> a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> after the withdrawal has been registered and notified to the public in the European Patent Bulletin, since in that case the retraction <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> would adversely affect the public interest or the interests of third parties.|$|R
