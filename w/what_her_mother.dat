5|$|While {{trying on}} her bridesmaid's dress in the TGS fitting room, Colleen, Sylvia Rossitano (Patti LuPone), and Verna Maroney (Jan Hooks) criticize Liz {{for not being}} married by now as she is in her late thirties, but Liz does not care what they think. Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting to find out <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a}} good decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E

25|$|Later in {{her line}} of work, In-ha discovers Choi Dal-po's real {{identity}} is Ki Ha-myung and is disgusted by <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> Cha-ok did {{to his family}} during the fire accident. In a lecture held by Cha-ok, In-ha stood up against her {{and in the process}} revealing to Jae-myung that Ha-myung, his dead brother, is actually alive. Together, they try to bring Cha-ok down through their honest news reporting all the while uncovering a bigger conspiracy in the news industry.|$|E
60|$|Nuttie was in {{a certain}} way {{realising}} for the first time <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> loyalty had checked her in expressing, even if the tumult of novelties had given her full time to dwell on it.|$|R
60|$|Tess did not expostulate. She knew <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> {{objection}} meant. Mrs Durbeyfield's {{jacket and}} bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated jaunt, {{the reason for}} which the matron deplored more than its necessity.|$|R
50|$|This spider {{was made}} {{well known in}} the book Charlotte's Web by American writer E. B. White, with a {{particularly}} interesting point that the spider's full name is Charlotte A. Cavatica, a reference to the barn spider's scientific name, Araneus cavaticus. Also one of Charlotte's daughters, after asking <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> middle initial was, names herself Aranea.|$|R
25|$|The {{prisoner}} Emma rescued {{is revealed}} to be none other than Maid Marian, who eagerly runs to embrace Robin Hood and Roland. A distraught Regina notes that Emma has done exactly <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> did: unintentionally ruin her chance for happiness by naively trying to make things better. Reduced to tears, Regina ominously warns Emma that Marian had better {{be the only thing}} she brought back. Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal. The lid pops off and releases a blue liquid, which after a moment coalesces into none other than Elsa. She removes her gloves and unleashes an icy blast that destroys her former prison, before heading out of the barn, leaving a trail of frozen ground behind her.|$|E
500|$|For evidence, Röhl {{reviewed}} letters between Charlotte and her doctor, {{as well as}} {{correspondence with}} her parents, that had been sent over a 25-year period; he found that even as a little girl, Charlotte had suffered from hyperactivity and indigestion. As a young woman, Charlotte became gravely ill with <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> called [...] "malaria poisoning and anaemia" [...] followed by [...] "neuralgia, fainting and nausea", all described by Röhl as a [...] "textbook list of the symptoms of porphyria, and this several decades before the disorder was clinically identified". Röhl also notes further symptoms described in letters between Charlotte and her physician Ernst Schweninger, who treated her for over two decades {{beginning in the early}} 1890s; in them, Charlotte variously complains of [...] "toothache, backache, insomnia, dizzy spells, nausea, constipation, excruciating 'wandering' abdominal pains, skin oedema and itching, partial paralysis of the legs and dark red or orange urine", the last of which Röhl calls the [...] "decisive diagnostic symptom".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the events}} of [...] "The Bells of Saint John", in which he {{encountered}} a third version of Clara, the Doctor decides {{to learn more about}} his new companion and travels into her past to observe her. He finds that her parents met by a chance encounter caused by a gust of wind blowing a leaf into her father's face and discovers that her mother died while Clara was a teenager. The Doctor goes back to the present and collects Clara, then takes her to the Rings of Akhaten, where they observe a series of planetoids orbiting a planet, with a shining pyramid on one of them. The Doctor takes Clara to a giant alien marketplace and introduces her to several aliens, including a merchant named Dor'een who attempts to rent them a space bike. The market does not use hard currency but rather trades in items of sentimental value; this appalls Clara, who believes sentimental items should be cherished and not given away. She becomes separated from the Doctor and encounters a little girl (Emilia Jones) who appears to be running and hiding. Clara catches up to her and she explains that her name is Merry Galel, the Queen of Years. Merry tells Clara that she is hiding because she is supposed to sing a song at a ceremony and she is afraid to get it wrong. Clara reassures her by telling her <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> once said, and Merry heads to the ceremony.|$|E

'It {{was of no}} use trying reason then, with that vehement panting {{creature}} (Heaven knows <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> story must have been); so I quietly {{told her that she}} should not go at that late hour of night, and I gave her MY hand and took her to her room, and locked the house doors. But she was gone this morning.' 'And you know no more of her?' ...|$|R
2500|$|While [...] "the South" [...] {{exists as}} a {{geographical}} {{region of the}} United States, it is also said to exist as [...] "a place of the imagination" [...] of writers.

Mitchell would later recall <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> had said to her: ...|$|E
2500|$|Min's self-reinvention extends also to her {{underwear}}. [...] In one scene, Nanette scolds Min {{for wearing}} white cotton underwear, because only sexy, lacy underwear will attract {{and keep a}} husband. [...] Crusie appears to give credence to this theory, describing Cal's [...] "light-headed" [...] moments when he catches a glimpse of Min's new red lace bra, before shattering it when Cal tells - and shows - Min that he finds her equally attractive in scruffy sweats as in fancy lace. Despite <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> has consistently told her, Min learns that a man will love her despite her lingerie and despite her weight.|$|E

60|$|Nuttie {{was going}} about, dry-eyed and numbed, glad of any passing {{occupation}} {{that would prevent}} the aching sense of desolation at her heart from gaining force to overwhelm her; courting employment, and shunning pity and condolence, {{but she could not}} escape when her uncle took her hand, made her sit down by him, with 'I want to speak to you, my dear;' and told her briefly and tenderly <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> effort had been, and of the message and task she had bequeathed. The poor girl's heart fainted within her.|$|R
60|$|This {{was a sad}} omen of <b>what</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> {{behaviour}} to {{the gentleman}} himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.|$|R
6000|$|By this time, Elina was {{thoroughly}} frightened.

2500|$|Martha Beck {{was born}} Martha Jule Seabrook on May 6, 1920 in Milton, Florida.
