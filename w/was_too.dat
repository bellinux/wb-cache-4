5|$|In October 2009, New Zealand's {{independent}} environmental watchdog, Jan Wright, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, made a {{submission to}} the Select Committee considering National's {{amendments to the}} NZ ETS.

30|$|The {{division}} of sub-regions {{has a great}} impact on the tracking effect. Each sub-region may be overlapped or non-overlapping; sub-region size can be fixed or adaptive. If the sub-region <b>is</b> <b>too</b> large, it will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> sensitive to occlusion, while if the sub-region <b>is</b> <b>too</b> small, it may lose target information and there will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> many sub-regions; thus, the computational cost of the algorithm will be very high. In this paper, the target is divided into four sub-regions.|$|R
