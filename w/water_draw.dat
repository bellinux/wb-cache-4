50|$|Starting in 1915 with Ashokan Reservoir, New York City {{had been}} {{expanding}} its {{water supply system}} with reservoirs in the Catskills. In 1937 it began construction of Merriman Dam near Lackawack, which would soon be flooded forever to allow the growing city to tap the pure waters Burroughs had written about. Those waters began to reach city taps in 1951, and the reservoir itself was completed three years later. Today, via the Delaware Aqueduct, and the connections it has via the Neversink Aqueduct to the Neversink, Pepacton and Cannonsville reservoirs to the west supplementing the upper Rondout's drainage, it supplies half the city's daily <b>water</b> <b>draw.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the {{classification}} of Archaeological cultures of North America, the term Plainview points refer to Paleoindian projectile points dated between 10,000-9,000 Before Present. The point was named in 1947 after {{the discovery of a}} large cache of unfluted, lanceolate spear tips with concave bases that were found in a Bison antiquus kill site along the Running <b>Water</b> <b>Draw</b> river, near the town of Plainview in Texas, United States.

50|$|The {{classification}} of the Plainview point {{was made in}} 1947 by Glen Evans, G. E. Meade and E. H. Sellards for a cache of unfluted, lanceolate spear tips with concave bases found along the Running <b>Water</b> <b>Draw</b> river {{near the town of}} Plainview in Texas. At least twenty-eight specimens were recovered from this location, which was the site of a Bison antiquus kill. Plainview was previously used as a general term to describe unfluted lanceolate points throughout the entirety of the Plains as well as the eastern Upper Mississippi Valley whereby points were classified as Plainview sub types. However this approach was later rejected and revised leading to new projectile point classifications. The Golondrina point (formally Plainview Golondrina) was one of these types mistakenly named as Plainview.|$|E
50|$|Opposition to the State Water Project was immediate, {{especially}} with Sacramento River Delta users worrying about saltwater intrusion {{which had already}} been a concern without factoring in redirection of outward freshwater flow. Residents of the Bay Area and elsewhere in Northern California {{were concerned about the}} increase in <b>water</b> <b>draw</b> the South might demand as populations expanded. While Southern support for the project was clear, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California worried that the project did not ensure permanent rights to Northern water. This lead the legislature to amend the plan, prohibiting the state's southern water rights from being rescinded, clearing any remaining reservations from the state's southern water authorities. Governor Brown was a staunch supporter of the plan, energetically opposing critics and seeking solutions. He lobbied Congress to exempt California from the 160 acre rule, lauding the benefit of employment and progress to the state's northern and southern residents, calling {{for an end to the}} north-south rivalry. Brown also reduced his introductory bond issuance from $11 billion to $1.75 billion, beginning a television campaign to appeal to residents. Governor Brown insisted on the Burns-Porter Act which sent the bond issue to a referendum; the 1960 vote saw Butte County as the sole Northern California county not voting against the measure. However, the growth in Southern California's population lead to the plan's adoption.|$|E
50|$|After {{graduation}} {{from high school}} Don Crabtree first worked for the Idaho Power Company. After dropping out of Long Beach Junior College in California he began working in paleontological laboratories. By the late 1930s he was the preparator in the vertebrate paleontology laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. It was during this time he became acquainted with Alfred L. Kroeber and E.W.Gifford of the Lowie Museum at Berkeley. His time at Berkeley also included conducting flint knapping demonstrations for scholars and students and occasionally for museum visitors. After his battle with cancer was over in 1941 he worked for several months at the Lithic Laboratory of the Ohio Historical Society. It was during this period that Crabtree was called upon as an advisor in lithic studies to the University of Pennsylvania, where he was associated with Edgar B. Howard and the Clovis point type site at Black <b>Water</b> <b>Draw.</b> Frank H. H. Roberts of the Smithsonian Institution also called upon him around this time to consult on {{the analysis of the}} Lindenmeier Folsom point collection. When the U.S. entered into World War II the Lithic lab was discontinued and Crabtree returned to California to assist in the war effort as a coordination engineer for Bethlehem Steel Company, which built the ships for the Pacific effort until the war ended. After WWII he returned to Twin Springs, Idaho and became a successful real estate salesman in the postwar market. Crabtree was employed from 1952 until 1962 as a county supervisor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) in Twin Falls. In March 1962 he opened the First Conference of Western Archaeologists on Problems of Point Typology at the Idaho State College Museum with a demonstration of his flintworking skills. In 1964 he was appointed Research Associate in Lithic Technology at the Pocatello Museum - a job he maintained until 1975.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to {{investigate}} the influence of auxiliary (electrical) power supply mode and load pattern (<b>water</b> <b>draw</b> profile) on the operating performance of a solar domestic thermosyphon with heat exchanger (indirect heating). To achieve this, a detailed theoretical model for such a system was developed. To check its validity, experimental work was carried out for the system under both no-draw and hot water withdrawal conditions. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results was very good. The analysis is then extended in order to study the methods of supplying auxiliary energy (inside the storage tank, in series or in a mixed way) to meet the loald requirements for a certain temperature hot water setting as well as hot <b>water</b> <b>draw</b> profile patterns. For this simulation a typical sequence of hourly values of solar radiation and ambient temperatures, based on meteorological data, are used (sunny, partly cloudy, hot, cold days, etc.). The results presented in terms of various performance parameters indicate the best method for maximizing the solar energy gain, and so minimizing the auxiliary power supply. © 1989...|$|E

The survey was conduced under Texas Antiquities Permit # 3707 between March 31 and April 7, 2005. Steve Tomka and Raymond Mauldin served as Principal Investigators. Trail construction included 2. 0 miles of additional construction and 1. 3 miles of improvements to existing trails. The Right-of-Way is 50 feet and extends from one to three feet below ground surface. Archeological services included a pedestrian survey, excavation of fifty-five auger tests placed no more than 100 m apart, and twenty-one Gradall trenches. Two of these trenches exposed the stratigraphy of Running <b>Water</b> <b>Draw</b> near the Plainview Site, 41 HA 1. Bulk samples were collected for OSL dating, diatoms analysis, and lithologic analysis for further examination of the age and stratigraphic context of the Plainview Site, which is a State Archeological Landmark, a National Landmark, and a National Register of Historic Places property. Site 41 HA 12 was re-examined with 10 mechanical auger tests and 1 trench, which found only recent alluvial and cultural deposition. No additional archeological sites were recorded.

40|$|The {{development}} and implementation of agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution control plans was mandated by the 1972 Federal Pollution Control Act Amendments, Public Law 92 - 500. The purpose of this particular report is to present the results of a study on the economic impact of implementing potential agricultural NPS pollution controls in Lower Running <b>Water</b> <b>Draw</b> watershed. The study focuses on: (a) the effects of erosion control on farm income, (b) off-site sediment damages in the watershed; (c) the costs of administering and enforcing alternative erosion controls, and (d) on-farm economics of soil conservation practices. Erosion controls considered include the traditional voluntary programs combined with economic incentives as well as possible regulatory programs. The focus of the study is on erosion and sedimentation because sediment is a potential transporter of pollutants. Practices to control agricultural non-point source pollution would probably be aimed at reducing soil loss. Conservation and conservation related practices are, at present, considered the best technical practices to abate agricultural non-point source pollution. This is a study of both conservation and environmental economics, two areas that tend to be closely related. For this project, the concern was over potential pollution (an off-site problem), but because of long-run farm income consequences, this concern cannot be separated from conservation problems (an on-farm problem). Accordingly, the report contains substantial information on the short and long-run on-farm benefits and costs of various soil conservation practices for the specific soil mapping units in Lower Running <b>Water</b> <b>Draw</b> watershed. The results of this study are applicable to the majority of the soils in the High Plains Land Resource Area. Only sheet and rill erosion are considered in the study. The first section of the report describes the selected "Best Management Practices" and examines the on-farm economics of soil conservation. The second section postulates various sediment damage control options and models the economic consequences of implementation, both to agricultural producers as a group, and to society...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. Sanitary hot water production make up to over 50 % of the monthly electrical energy consumption in South Africa residential sector. Employing an effective and efficient mechanism for sanitary hot water heating {{can lead to a}} substantial energy saving and demand reduction as well as creating a benign environment owing to the decrease of the carbon dioxide emission. Most of the renewable energy devices for sanitary hot water heating utilized the free and abundant solar energy. Domestic air source heat pump (ASHP) water heater is one of the renewable energy device used for sanitary hot water production. In this study, a data acquisition system (DAS) was constructed to measure the predictors (E, electrical energy consumed) and (, average product of ambient temperature and relative humidity) and relevant parameters to compute the COP during the vapor compression refrigerant cycle (VCRC) of the ASHP unit. The coefficient of performance (COP) of an ASHP water heater under two different heating up cycle scenarios were critically examined. Modelling and simulation of the COP of the system provided a distinctive opportunity for optimization and prediction of its performance under different operational conditions. It was depicted that the mean COP in the both scenarios of the heating up cycles (firstly, where there was no successive hot <b>water</b> <b>draw</b> off and secondly, with simultaneous hot <b>water</b> <b>draw</b> off) was on average 2 and above. Finally, using the mathematical models in the both scenarios, it was revealed that increases in both predictors (E and ) can result to decrease in the COP. The one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed, the mean COP of 1. 96 and 2. 14 for the heating up scenario of simultaneous hot water drawn off and without a successive hot water drawn off. Predictors’ weight ranking demonstrated that the contribution from the input parameters was 100 times more during the heating up scenario whereby successive hot water drawn off occurred. The modelled equations were used in the mathematical blocks of the Simulink to design the simulation application of the COP of an ASHP water heater. We therefore concluded that the COP of an ASHP water heater during simultaneous hot water drawn off was higher than without successive hot water drawn off. cf 201...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{shortages}} of water supplies coupled with deteriorating {{quality of the}} sources has made the earlier paradigms of water resources planning irrelevant. Today's planner needs to adopt a holistic systems approach which considers surface water and ground water as complementary resources {{paving the way for}} implementation of conjunctive use concept. In the present study, the conjunctive use model is constructed as an allocation model of surface water and ground water which is constrained by system dynamics comprising of recharge-discharge boundaries of ground water aquifers and inflow-outflow of surface water bodies. The resulting non-linear programming model is solved by employing Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique. Finite element method is employed for solving the governing groundwater flow equation and the resulting hydraulics are incorporated in the optimization model by adopting unit response matrix technique. The validity of the developed integrated model is demonstrated by applying it to a field problem. The results indicate that the developed mathematical model is robust and capable of simulating the system hydraulics satisfactorily and is responding to the demand variations, cost variations, surface water mass balance and ground <b>water</b> <b>draw</b> down constraints reliably...|$|E
