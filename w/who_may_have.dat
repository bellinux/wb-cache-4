5|$|Due {{to their}} nonspecific character, these {{symptoms}} are not often recognized {{as signs of}} HIV infection.

5|$|It was Geoffrey Barrow's belief, {{supported}} by Donald Watt, that their decision {{was the result}} of pressure from the new Scottish king, Robert de Brus, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> valued Balmyle's experience and trusted his political record. The usual secular patron of the diocese was the Mormaer of Strathearn, but the incumbent Maol Íosa III was at that stage a prisoner-exile at Rochester in England, thus allowing Robert to take his place.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{they are}} {{referred}} to, in Latin, as magnus rotulus pipae.

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E

5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated along religious lines, the rebels' commented {{caused a}} negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau called on Buddhists {{to support the}} incumbent junta. The pro-Diệm speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist and anti-Diệm generals, such as Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Hữu Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively. They thought that Thảo and Phat might seek revenge, driving many anti-Diệm officers <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E
5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated {{in favor}} of minority Catholics and placed restrictions on Buddhism, the rebels' radio addresses caused an unsurprisingly negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau spoke from a radio station in Nha Trang, exhorting his co-religionists to support the incumbent junta. The Diemist speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist or anti-Diệm generals, such as Thi and Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively, and feared retribution from Thảo and Phát. The speeches drove many anti-Diệm officers <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E
5|$|As {{the format}} of Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, who played lead actor Tony and understudy Jim respectively, the episode starred Lyndsey Marshal as Laura, Julia Davis as Felicity, Rosie Cavaliero as Kirstie, Roger Sloman as Bill, Di Botcher as Jean, and Richard Cordery as Nick. In addition, Bruce Mackinnon provided the voice of an actor playing Malcolm in Macbeth, and Jo Stone-Fewings provided the voice of an actor playing Macduff.|$|E
