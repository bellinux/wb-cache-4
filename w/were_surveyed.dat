5|$|There were rumours that Levant would swiftly {{return to}} active service, but these proved unfounded and she {{remained}} tied up at Portsmouth. Her hull and fittings <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> in late 1763 to determine maintenance requirements, but no repairs were made. In September 1763 {{a member of}} her skeleton crew was robbed and murdered at Liphook, a village some distance from Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town <b>were</b> <b>surveyed,</b> and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Statistics Canada's General Social Survey of 10,000 households, the average man spent under {{two hours a day}} dealing with {{childcare}} and house work while women on average spent a little more than three. This study highlights the unequal distribution of labor between partners. Of the people surveyed, under fifteen percent of the couples agreed on doing around the same amount of work in the house. About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 percent of men who <b>were</b> <b>surveyed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lily Lake was {{stocked with}} brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout in 1991. It <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> four times between 1994 and 2000. It <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> {{again by the}} Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in 2013. The lake <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> once more on May 12, 2014 {{to examine the effects}} of alewives on the lake's largemouth bass population.|$|R

50|$|Land around Wembley <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> for homesteads in 1909, {{settlers}} {{beginning to}} arrive in 1910. The railroad <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> completed from Grande Prairie to Pouce Coupe in 1916 and the townsite of Wembley <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> in 1923. The railway arrived in 1924.|$|R
5|$|The Basingstoke {{committee}} then investigated {{a link to}} the Andover Canal, but in December 1792, interest switched back to a {{link with}} the Itchen. A meeting was held in Southampton, which was chaired by the mayor and included James D'Arcy on the committee. It became part of a much grander scheme to link Bristol to Salisbury, and onwards to London, but although most of this soon died away, the Itchen to Basingstoke link was still being considered in 1796, by which time it was called the London and Southampton Ports Junction Canal. Two routes <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> by different engineers, one costing £127,000 and the other £157,566.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the state {{boundaries}} marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments {{in the area to}} combat the spread of slavery to the region. When the early territories were formed, their boundaries were designated along meridian and parallel lines. Beginning in the 1860s, these lines <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> and marked. These early surveys included some errors, but even so, the markers placed became the legal boundaries, superseding the written descriptions of geographical meridians and parallels. This includes the Four Corners Monument, which has been legally established as the corner of the four states.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.|$|E
50|$|When it <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> in 1985, Majlis al Jinn was {{the second}} largest known cave chamber {{in the world by}} volume. However, more than 15 {{chambers}} larger than Majlis al Jinn have <b>been</b> <b>surveyed</b> since that time.|$|R

5|$|The {{project was}} {{split into two}} parts – the {{northern}} section of 742.7km from the Belfry, Dunkirk to Rodez Cathedral which <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> by Delambre and the southern section of 333.0km from Rodez to the Montjuïc Fortress, Barcelona which <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> by Méchain.|$|R
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|Frances is {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to impact the entire archipelago since 1866. On September 4, teams from the Ministry of Works, the Department of Environmental Health Services, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were used to clear roadways of tree debris while utilities attempted to restore power and water in New Providence. The Family Islands <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> on September 5 and 6, when {{it was noted that}} major damage occurred within the island group. Telecommunications were restored to most of the island chain within 24 hours. As of September 21, electricity had been restored to half of the Bahamians who had lost power. Western sections of Grand Bahama Island remained without power into Hurricane Jeanne, which was the most significantly impacted island. The onion crop was expected to be late in 2005 due to the loss of seedbeds and seedlings during the storm.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1788 Jones' team {{began their}} survey of Grimsby Township; it was {{completed}} November 13, 1788. Saltfleet Township was surveyed from November 14, 1788 to December 25, 1788 and Binbrook Township was surveyed from December 24, 1788 until February 12, 1789. All of these townships <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> using the Front and Rear system, except Binbrook, which was surveyed with the Single Front system. During this time, Frey had assigned two other surveyors to lead surveys in the Nassau district. Daniel Hazen and Jesse Pawling both led teams, but neither group was {{as busy as}} Jones' group. Hazen's group surveyed only four townships, and incompletely, and Pawling's three, also incompletely. In November 1789 Jones began acting as the deputy surveyor in Nassau District as Frey had left Upper Canada, and he officially received the position in early 1791 {{on the order of}} Deputy Surveyor General John Collins.|$|E
50|$|The {{portion of}} Wayne Township {{east of the}} Little Miami is in the Virginia Military District and <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> with the metes and bounds system, while the area west of the Little Miami <b>was</b> <b>surveyed</b> on the same plan as used in the Symmes Purchase.|$|R

5|$|Cleveland {{iron ore}} {{is high in}} {{phosphorus}} {{and needs to be}} mixed with purer ores, such as those on the west coast in Cumberland and Lancashire. In the early 1850s this ore was travelling the long way round over the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway to the Barrow-in-Furness area, and Durham coke was returning. Both the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway (SD) and the Eden Valley Railway (EVR) companies were formed on 20 September 1856. Taking advantage of the new railway at Barnard Castle, the SD crossed the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to meet the West Coast Main Line (WCML) at Tebay, on the section then controlled by the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway, and also linked Barnard Castle with West Auckland. The EVR was a branch from Kirkby Stephen to the WCML near Penrith via Appleby. The routes <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> by Thomas Bouch and SD received permission on 13 July 1857. The EVR route followed the east bank of the River Eden, a mile longer than a more expensive route on the west bank, and its Act received royal assent on 21 May 1858.|$|E
5|$|Lower North East Road {{runs around}} Anstey Hill {{and up the}} {{escarpment}} of the Burnside-Eden Fault Zone. It connects the suburbsformerly villagesof Hope Valley and Houghton. Three roads <b>were</b> <b>surveyed</b> and built to connect the same locations. The first was a private road constructed by George Anstey in 1841although officially surveyed in 1844to reach his estate, as a mostly straight-line extension of Grand Junction Road. It followed {{the base of a}} gully, before rising steeply up Anstey Hill. From 1842 to 1846, Anstey constructed a replacement private road with a devil's elbow (double hairpin bend) that followed the land's contours more closely. As Chairman of Roads for the District of Yatala, Anstey allocated most of the district's funding to his road, leading to a public outcry that forced him from office in 1851. This ungravelled road became known as Anstey Hill Road and remained in use for 20 years. New Road, later renamed Houghton Road and subsequently Lower North East Road, was constructed in 1873 as a replacement. It was longer than the preceding roads but lacked a devil's elbow, was more evenly sloped, and was paved in 1930. It now separates {{a small part of the}} parkthat contains Klopper's quarries and the Gun Emplacementfrom the rest. Remains of the two previous roads can be seen near Klopper's quarries.|$|E
