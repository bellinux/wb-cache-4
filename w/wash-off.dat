40|$|CG- 4 H 2 S adsorbent, an {{iron oxide}} based solid, has high sulfur {{capacity}} (20 - 25 % w/w) and thus finds favor in users’ eyes in North America. This product, imported from CLEAN Catalysis and Purification Technologies Development Company in Shanxi Province, China, {{is now being}} used in gas processing companies in Alberta, Canada and Texas, USA. However, due to the elemental sulfur deposition on the adsorbent, the recovered sulfur capacity by regeneration is only about 1 / 3 as that of fresh adsorbent. This limits the adsorbent use to be once, which results in higher operating cost due to the frequent changeover and cost for landfills. The problem of sulfur deposition is also the limitation to the utilization and regeneration of other desulfurization adsorbent or catalyst. This study developed a process to recover the sulfur capacity of CG- 4 adsorbent by ammonia leaching to remove elemental sulfur. The leaching was conducted in a stainless steel cylindrical reactor at room temperature and a pressure higher than the vapor pressure of liquid ammonia. The leaching process does not deleteriously change the physical strength, but improve the properties of surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution. The new regeneration process is able to recover over 90 % sulfur capacity in the first adsorption-regeneration cycle. The sulfur capacity recovery declined when CG- 4 had been leached {{for more than one}} time. Nonetheless, even after the third time leaching, the sulfur capacity was recovered by 60 %. The conditions of leaching process were optimized in a laboratory-scale experiment. Additionally, the elemental sulfur collected from leaching process has 91. 5 % w/w purity and can likely be used as an additive to asphalt or used as a soil amendment for agricultural applications. The separation of solid <b>wash-offs</b> and liquid ammonia was simply fulfilled by depressurizing the leaching vessel and vaporizing the ammonia. CG- 4 adsorbent is verified capable of at least three times reuses, which results in 60 % reduction in disposal amount per unit H 2 S being treated. This not only reduces the cost in disposal to landfills but also the cost in CG- 4 adsorbent and brings the revenue from the recovered elemental sulfur.

40|$|This paper characterises {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> processes on urban road surfaces to create fundamental knowledge to strengthen stormwater treatment design. The study outcomes confirmed that the composition of initially available nutrients {{in terms of their}} physical association with solids and chemical speciation determines the <b>wash-off</b> characteristics. Nitrogen and phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> processes are independent of land use, but there are notable differences. Nitrogen <b>wash-off</b> is a “source limiting” process while phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> is “transport limiting”. Additionally, a clear separation between {{nitrogen and}} phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> processes based on dissolved and particulate forms confirmed that the common approach of replicating nutrients <b>wash-off</b> based on solids <b>wash-off</b> could lead to misleading outcomes particularly in the case of nitrogen. Nitrogen is present primarily in dissolved and organic form and readily removed even by low intensity rainfall events, which is an important consideration for nitrogen removal targeted treatment design. In the case of phosphorus, phosphate constitutes the primary species in <b>wash-off</b> for the particle size fraction 75 µm. This means that phosphorus removal targeted treatment design should consider both phosphorus speciation as well as particle size...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} adopted {{for investigating}} {{the relationship between}} rainfall characteristics and pollutant <b>wash-off</b> process is commonly based {{on the use of}} parameters which represent the entire rainfall event.

This research study analysed the influence of rainfall characteristics on the pollutant <b>wash-off</b> process using two sets of innovative parameters by partitioning <b>wash-off</b> and rainfall characteristics. It was found that the initial 10 % of the <b>wash-off</b> process is closely linked to runoff volume related rainfall parameters including rainfall depth and rainfall duration while the remaining part of the <b>wash-off</b> process is primarily influenced by kinetic energy related rainfall parameters, namely, rainfall intensity.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{outcomes of}} a research study conducted to investigate the nutrient build-up and <b>wash-off</b> processes on urban impervious surfaces. The data needed for the study was generated {{through a series of}} field investigations and laboratory test procedures. The study sites were selected in urbanised catchments to represent typical characteristics of residential, industrial and commercial land uses. The build-up and <b>wash-off</b> samples were collected from road surfaces in the selected study sites. A specially designed vacuum collection system and a rainfall simulator were used for sample collection. According to the data analysis, the solids build-up on road surfaces was significantly finer with more than 80 % of the particles below 150 ìm for all the land uses. Nutrients were mostly associated with the particle size range below 150 ìm in both build-up and <b>wash-off</b> samples irrespective of type of land use. Therefore, the finer fraction of solids was the most important for the nutrient build-up and particulate nutrient <b>wash-off</b> processes. Consequently, the design of stormwater quality mitigation measures should target particles less than 150 ìm for the removal of nutrients irrespective of type of land use. Total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) was the most dominant form of nitrogen species in build-up on road surfaces. Phosphorus build-up on road surfaces was mainly in inorganic form and phosphate (PO 4 3 -) was the most dominant form. The nutrient <b>wash-off</b> process was found to be dependent on rainfall intensity and duration. Concentration of both total nitrogen and phosphorus was higher {{at the beginning of the}} rain event and decreased with the increase in rainfall duration. Consequently, in the design of stormwater quality mitigation strategies for nutrients removal, it is important to target the initial period of rain events. The variability of <b>wash-off</b> of nitrogen with rainfall intensity was significantly different to phosphorus <b>wash-off.</b> The concentration of nitrogen was higher in the <b>wash-off</b> for low intensity rain events compared to the <b>wash-off</b> for high intensity rain events. On the other hand, the concentration of phosphorus in the <b>wash-off</b> was high for high intensity rain events compared to low intensity rain events. Consequently, the nitrogen washoff can be defined as a source limiting process and phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> as a transport limiting process. This highlights the importance of taking into consideration the <b>wash-off</b> of low intensity rain events in the design of stormwater quality mitigation strategies targeting the nitrogen removal. All the nitrogen species in <b>wash-off</b> are primarily in dissolved form whereas phosphorus is in particulate form. The differences in the nitrogen and phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> processes is principally due to the degree of solubility, attachment to particulates, composition of total nitrogen and total phosphorus and the degree of adherence of the solids particles to the surface to which nutrients are attached. The particulate nitrogen available for <b>wash-off</b> is removed readily as these are mobilised as free solids particles on the surface. Phosphorus is washed-off mostly with the solids particles which are strongly adhered to the surface or as the fixed solids load. Investigation of the nitrogen <b>wash-off</b> process using bulk <b>wash-off</b> samples was in close agreement with the investigation of dissolved fraction of <b>wash-off</b> solids. This was primarily due to the predominant nature of dissolved nitrogen. However, the investigation of the processes which underpin phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> using bulk washoff samples could lead to loss of information. This is due to the composition of total phosphorus in <b>wash-off</b> solids and the inherent variability of the <b>wash-off</b> process for the different particle size ranges. This variability should preferably be taken into consideration as phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> is predominantly in particulate form. Therefore, care needs to be taken in the investigation of the phosphorus <b>wash-off</b> process using bulk <b>wash-off</b> samples to ensure that there is no loss of information and hence result in misleading outcomes. The investigation of different particle size ranges of <b>wash-off</b> solids is preferable in the interest of designing effective stormwater quality management strategies targeting phosphorus removal...|$|E
40|$|Variability in the {{pollutant}} <b>wash-off</b> {{process is a}} concept which needs to be understood in-depth {{in order to better}} assess the outcomes of stormwater quality models, and thereby strengthen stormwater pollution mitigation strategies. Current knowledge about the <b>wash-off</b> process does not extend to a clear understanding of the influence of the initially available pollutant build-up on the variability of {{the pollutant}} <b>wash-off</b> load and composition. Consequently, pollutant <b>wash-off</b> process variability is poorly characterised in stormwater quality models, which can result in inaccurate stormwater quality predictions. Mathematical simulation of particulate <b>wash-off</b> from three urban road surfaces confirmed that the <b>wash-off</b> load of particle size fractions 150 µm after a storm event vary with the build-up of the respective particle size fractions available {{at the beginning of the}} storm event.

40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{understanding of}} the road-deposited sediments (RDS) <b>wash-off</b> process is essential to estimation of urban surface runoff pollution load and to designing methods to minimize the adverse impacts on the receiving waters. There are two debatable RDS <b>wash-off</b> views: source limited and transport limited. The RDS build-up and <b>wash-off</b> process was characterized to explore what determines the <b>wash-off</b> process to be source limited or transport limited based on twelve RDS sampling activities on an urban road in Beijing. The results showed that two natural rain events (2. 0 mm and 23. 2 mm) reduced the total RDS mass by 30 %- 40 %, and that finer particles (< 105 mu m) contributed 60 %- 80 % of the <b>wash-off</b> load. Both single- and multi-rain events caused the RDS particle grain size to become coarser, while dry days made the RDS particle grain size finer. These findings indicated that the bulk RDS particles <b>wash-off</b> tends to be transport limited, but that finer particles tend to be source limited. To further explore and confirm {{the results of the}} field experiment, a total of 40 simulated rain events were designed to observe the RDS <b>wash-off</b> with different particle size fractions. The finer particles have a higher <b>wash-off</b> percentage (F-w) than the coarser particles, and the F-w values provide a good view to characterize the <b>wash-off</b> process. The key conclusions drawn from the combined field and simulated experiments data are: (i) Finer and coarser particle <b>wash-off</b> processes tend to be source limited and transport limited, respectively. (ii) The source and transport limited processes occur during the initial period (the first flush) and later periods, respectively. (iii) The smaller and larger rain events tend to be transport limited and source limited, respectively. Overall, the <b>wash-off</b> process is generally a combination of source and transport limited processes. (c) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{build-up}} and <b>wash-off</b> process {{uncertainty is}} important for accurate interpretation of model outcomes to facilitate informed decision making for developing effective stormwater pollution mitigation strategies. Uncertainty inherent to pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off</b> processes influences the variations in pollutant loads entrained in stormwater runoff from urban catchments. However, build-up and <b>wash-off</b> predictions from stormwater quality models do not adequately represent such variations due to poor characterisation of the variability of these processes in mathematical models. The changes to the mathematical form of current models with the incorporation of process variability, facilitates accounting for process uncertainty without significantly affecting the model prediction performance. Moreover, the investigation of uncertainty propagation from build-up to <b>wash-off</b> confirmed that uncertainty in build-up process significantly influences <b>wash-off</b> process uncertainty.

Two processes {{were included in the}} <b>wash-off</b> equation: HM transport (solid fraction) and HM leaching (dissolved fraction). The average <b>wash-off</b> of HMs ranges from 16. 6 to 46. 3 %, relative to the total mass of HMs associated with dry-weather RDS (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Fe, Mn, Co, and Ba).

40|$|Urban {{traffic and}} climate change are two {{phenomena}} that {{have the potential to}} degrade urban water quality by influencing the build-up and <b>wash-off</b> of pollutants, respectively.

In this research, pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off</b> have been investigated from a dynamic point of view which incorporated the impacts of changed urban traffic as well as changes in the rainfall characteristics induced by climate change.

40|$|Among {{the urban}} aquatic pollutants, {{the most common}} is {{sediment}} which also acts as a transport medium for many contaminants. Hence there is an increasing interest {{in being able to}} better predict the sediment <b>wash–off</b> from urban surfaces. The exponential <b>wash-off</b> model is the most widely used method to predict the sediment <b>wash-off.</b> Although a number of studies proposed various modifications to the original exponential <b>wash-off</b> equation, these studies mostly looked into one parameter in isolation thereby ignoring the interactions between the parameters corresponding to rainfall, catchment and sediment characteristics. Hence in this study we aim (a) to investigate the effect of rainfall intensity, surface slope and initial load on <b>wash-off</b> load in an integrated and systematic way and (b) to subsequently improve the exponential <b>wash-off</b> equation focusing on the effect of the aforementioned three parameters. A series of laboratory experiments were carried out in a full-scale setup, comprising of a rainfall simulator, a 1 m 2 bituminous road surface, and a continuous <b>wash-off</b> measuring system. Five rainfall intensities ranging from 33 to 155 mm/h, four slopes ranging from 2 to 16 % and three initial loads ranging from 50 to 200 g/m 2 were selected based on values obtained from the literature. Fine sediment with a size range of 300 – 600 µm was used for all of the tests. Each test was carried out for one hour with at least 9 <b>wash-off</b> samples per test collected. Mass balance checks were carried out for all the tests as a quality control measure {{to make sure that there}} is no significant loss of sand during the tests. Results show that the washed off sediment load at any given time is proportional to initial load for a given combination of rainfall intensity and surface slope. This indicates the importance of dedicated modelling of build-up so as to subsequently predict <b>wash-off</b> load. It was also observed that the maximum fraction that is washed off from the surface increases with both rainfall intensity and the surface slope. This observation leads to the second part of the study where the existing <b>wash-off</b> model is modified by introducing a capacity factor which defines this maximum fraction. This capacity factor is derived as a function of <b>wash-off</b> coefficient, making use of the correlation between the maximum fraction and the <b>wash-off</b> rate.

Poor characterisation of process variability constrains the accurate accounting of the uncertainty associated with pollutant processes.

The study sites encompassed three different urban land uses. Nine heavy metals commonly associated with traffic emissions were selected. The results were interpreted using multivariate data analysis and decision making tools, such as principal component analysis (PCA), fuzzy clustering (FC), PROMETHEE and GAIA. Initial analyses established high, low and moderate traffic scenarios as well as low, low to moderate, moderate, high and extreme rainfall scenarios for build-up and <b>wash-off</b> investigations.

However, in <b>wash-off,</b> metal concentrations in 1 - 75 µm fraction were found to be independent of the changes to rainfall characteristics. In build-up, high traffic activities in commercial and industrial areas influenced the accumulation of heavy metal concentrations in particulate size range from 75 - > 300 µm, whereas metal concentrations in finer size range of 300 µm can be targeted for removal of Ni, Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr and Zn from build-up whilst organic matter from 300 µm can be targeted for removal of Cd, Cr, Pb and Ni from <b>wash-off.</b> Cu and Zn need to be removed as free ions from most fractions in <b>wash-off...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Estimation of {{runoff water}} quality {{parameters}} {{is required to}} determine appropriate water quality management options. Various models are used to estimate runoff water quality parameters. However, most models provide event-based estimates of water quality parameters for specific sites. The work {{presented in this paper}} describes the development of a model that continuously simulates the accumulation and <b>wash-off</b> of water quality pollutants in a catchment. The model allows estimation of pollutants build-up during dry periods and pollutants <b>wash-off</b> during storm events. The model was developed by integrating two individual models; rainfall-runoff model, and catchment water quality model. The rainfall-runoff model is based on the time-area runoff estimation method. The model allows users to estimate the time of concentration using a range of established methods. The model also allows estimation of the continuing runoff losses using any of the available estimation methods (i. e., constant, linearly varying or exponentially varying). Pollutants build-up in a catchment was represented by one of three pre-defined functions; power, exponential, or saturation. Similarly, pollutants <b>wash-off</b> was represented by one of three different functions; power, rating-curve, or exponential. The developed runoff water quality model was set-up to simulate the build-up and <b>wash-off</b> of total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). The application of the model was demonstrated using available runoff and TSS field data from road and roof surfaces in the Gold Coast, Australia.

Uncertainty in stormwater quality models can originate {{from a range of}} sources such as the complexity of urban rainfall-runoff-stormwater pollutant processes and the paucity of observed data. Unfortunately, studies relating to epistemic uncertainty, which arises from the simplification of reality are limited and often deemed mostly unquantifiable.

Additionally, other than conventional catchment characteristics, namely, land use and impervious surface fraction, other catchment characteristics such as impervious area layout, urban form and site specific characteristics have an important influence on both, pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off</b> processes.

The study outcomes found that the distribution of Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were consistent over particle size fractions 150 µm, with most metals concentrated in the particle size fraction 150 µm, which are influenced by particle characteristics such as organic matter content. The behavioural variability of particles determines the variations in the heavy metals load entrained in stormwater runoff. Accordingly, the variability in build-up and <b>wash-off</b> of particle-bound pollutants needs to be characterised {{in the description of}} pollutant attachment to particulates in stormwater quality modelling. This will ensure the accounting of process uncertainty, and thereby enhancing the interpretation of the outcomes derived from modelling studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{aimed at}} {{treating}} the new database on cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 transfer by <b>wash-off</b> collected by IRSN {{in the framework}} of the Franco-German Initiative for Chernobyl. It focused on the 71 runoff plot (from 1 to 400 m 2) experiments conducted under artificial rainfalls in the Chernobyl district between 1986 and 1998. These data, mostly still unpublished, provide a quantification of <b>wash-off</b> at the rainfall scale, still rare for radionuclides. Normalized entrainment coefficients by liquid and solid <b>wash-off</b> were calculated for each experiment. In average, the liquid entrainment coefficient was 10 – 5 mm– 1 for cesium, and 10 – 3. 8 mm– 1 for strontium. The solid entrainment coefficient was 10 – 41 m 2 g– 1 for cesium and 10 – 4. 3 m 2 g– 1 for strontium. These trends and values were found consistent with reported values in the literature. For assessment purposes, the extrapolation of these coefficients to wider areas and to other sites would need their physical interpretation. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{predicted}} {{changes in}} rainfall characteristics due {{to climate change}} could adversely affect stormwater quality in highly urbanised coastal areas throughout the world. This in turn will exert a significant influence on the discharge of pollutants to estuarine and marine waters. Hence, an in-depth analysis {{of the effects of}} such changes on the <b>wash-off</b> of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from urban roads in the Gold Coast region in Australia was undertaken. The rainfall characteristics were simulated using a rainfall simulator. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multicriteria Decision tools such as PROMETHEE and GAIA were employed to understand the VOC <b>wash-off</b> under climate change. It was found that low, low to moderate and high rain events due to climate change will affect the <b>wash-off</b> of toluene, ethylbenzene, meta-xylene, para-xylene and ortho-xylene from urban roads in Gold Coast. Total organic carbon (TOC) was identified as predominant carrier of toluene, meta-xylene and para-xylene in 300 µm fractions under such dominant rain events due to climate change. However, ortho-xylene did not show such affinity towards either TOC or TSS (total suspended solids) under the simulated climatic conditions...|$|E

40|$|Estimation of {{runoff water}} quality {{parameters}} {{is required to}} determine appropriate water quality management options. Various models are used to estimate runoff water quality parameters. However, most models provide event-based estimates of water quality parameters for specific sites. The work {{presented in this paper}} describes the development of a model that continuously simulates the accumulation and <b>wash-off</b> of water quality pollutants in a catchment. The model allows estimation of pollutants build-up during dry periods and pollutants <b>wash-off</b> during storm events. The model was developed by integrating two individual models; rainfall-runoff model, and catchment water quality model. The rainfall-runoff model is based on the time-area runoff estimation method. The model allows users to estimate the time of concentration using a range of established methods. The model also allows estimation of the continuing runoff losses using any of the available estimation methods (i. e., constant, linearly varying or exponentially varying). Pollutants build-up in a catchment was represented by one of three pre-defined functions; power, exponential, or saturation. Similarly, pollutants <b>wash-off</b> was represented by one of three different functions; power, rating-curve, or exponential. The developed runoff water quality model was set-up to simulate the build-up and <b>wash-off</b> of total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). The application of the model was demonstrated using available runoff and TSS field data from road and roof surfaces in the Gold Coast, Australia. The model provided excellent representation of the field data demonstrating the simplicity yet effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|E

Data collected during two monitoring campaigns carried out at the plot scale within a residential area and an auto dismantler site are used to this aim. The observed runoff events are classified into different mass delivery processes and the occurrence of the first flush phenomenon is also investigated. The maximum flow discharge obtained as the average value over the time of concentration of the drainage network is proposed as the controlling factor for the total mass of pollutant that is made available for <b>wash-off</b> during each runoff event...|$|E
40|$|As {{the concept}} of {{sustainable}} communities is gaining increasing recognition around the world it is of critical importance to investigate the water quality of urban environments. The contamination of waterways in urban communities seriously affects the utility of water for different purposes and degrades the aesthetic value of natural watercourses. Research investigations {{in the past have}} generally focused on suspended solids and nutrients, which are relatively easy to monitor. Unfortunately the build-up and <b>wash-off</b> of micro pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals (HM) have received limited research interest in urban water quality research even though these can cause significant health and environmental impacts even at low concentrations. This paper describes how artificial rainfall, using a specially designed highly portable rainfall simulator was employed in order to generate water quality data from urban environments. This approach was adopted in order to investigate the <b>wash-off</b> of pollutants from paved surfaces and to overcome constraints due to the highly unreliable rainfall in South-East Queensland Australia. The rainfall simulator was able to demonstrate its ability to satisfactory simulate natural rainfall in the area. The results obtained confirmed that the rainfall simulator is a reliable tool for urban water quality research and can be used to simulate pollutant <b>wash-off...</b>|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of stormwater quality {{is essential for}} developing effective pollution mitigation strategies. The use of models incorporating simplified mathematical replications of pollutant processes is the common practice for determining stormwater quality. However, an inherent process uncertainty arises due to the intrinsic variability associated with pollutant processes, which has neither been comprehensively understood, nor well accounted for in uncertainty assessment of stormwater quality modelling. This review provides the context for defining and quantifying the uncertainty associated with pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off</b> on urban impervious surfaces based on the hypothesis that particle size is predominant in influencing process variability. Critical analysis of published research literature brings scientific evidence together {{in order to establish}} the fact that particle size changes with time, and different sized particles exhibit distinct behaviour during build-up and <b>wash-off,</b> resulting in process variability. Analysis of the different adsorption behaviour of particles confirmed that the variations in pollutant load and composition are influenced by particle size. Particle behaviour and variations in pollutant load and composition are related due to the strong affinity of pollutants such as heavy metals and hydrocarbons for specific particle size ranges. As such, the temporal variation in particle size is identified as the key to establishing a basis for assessing build-up and <b>wash-off</b> process uncertainty. Therefore, accounting for pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off</b> process variability, which is influenced by particle size, would facilitate the assessment of the uncertainty associated with modelling outcomes. Furthermore, the review identified fundamental knowledge gaps where further research is needed in relation to: (1) the aggregation of particles suspended in the atmosphere during build-up; (2) particle re-suspension during wash-off; (3) pollutant re-adsorption by different particle size fractions; and (4) development of evidence-based techniques for assessing uncertainty; and (5) methods for translating the knowledge acquired from the investigation of process mechanisms at small scale into catchment scale for stormwater quality modelling...|$|E
40|$|This thesis details {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} urban stormwater quality {{based on a}} set of easy to measure physico-chemical parameters. These parameters can be used as surrogate parameters to estimate other key water quality parameters. The key pollutants considered in this study are nitrogen compounds, phosphorus compounds and solids. The use of surrogate parameter relationships to evaluate urban stormwater quality will reduce the cost of monitoring and so that scientists will have added capability to generate a large amount of data for more rigorous analysis of key urban stormwater quality processes, namely, pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off.</b> This in turn will assist in the development of more stringent stormwater quality mitigation strategies. The research methodology was based on a series of field investigations, laboratory testing and data analysis. Field investigations were conducted to collect pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off</b> samples from residential roads and roof surfaces. Past research has identified that these impervious surfaces are the primary pollutant sources to urban stormwater runoff. A specially designed vacuum system and rainfall simulator were used in the collection of pollutant build-up and <b>wash-off</b> samples. The collected samples were tested for a range of physico-chemical parameters. Data analysis was conducted using both univariate and multivariate data analysis techniques. Analysis of build-up samples showed that pollutant loads accumulated on road surfaces are higher compared to the pollutant loads on roof surfaces. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} fraction of solids smaller than 150 ìm is the most polluted particle size fraction in solids build-up on both roads and roof surfaces. The analysis of <b>wash-off</b> data confirmed that the simulated <b>wash-off</b> process adopted for this research agrees well with the general understanding of the <b>wash-off</b> process on urban impervious surfaces. The observed pollutant concentrations in <b>wash-off</b> from road surfaces were different to pollutant concentrations in <b>wash-off</b> from roof surfaces. Therefore, firstly, the identification of surrogate parameters was undertaken separately for roads and roof surfaces. Secondly, a common set of surrogate parameter relationships were identified for both surfaces together to evaluate urban stormwater quality. Surrogate parameters were identified for nitrogen, phosphorus and solids separately. Electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), total solids (TS) and turbidity (TTU) were selected as the relatively easy to measure parameters. Consequently, surrogate parameters for nitrogen and phosphorus were identified from the set of easy to measure parameters for both road surfaces and roof surfaces. Additionally, surrogate parameters for TSS, TDS and TS which are key indicators of solids were obtained from EC and TTU which can be direct field measurements. The regression relationships which were developed for surrogate parameters and key parameter of interest were of a similar format for road and roof surfaces, namely it was in the form of simple linear regression equations. The identified relationships for road surfaces were DTN-TDS:DOC, TP-TS:TOC, TSS-TTU, TDS-EC and TSTTU: EC. The identified relationships for roof surfaces were DTN-TDS and TSTTU: EC. Some of the relationships developed had a higher confidence interval whilst others had a relatively low confidence interval. The relationships obtained for DTN-TDS, DTN-DOC, TP-TS and TS-EC for road surfaces demonstrated good near site portability potential. Currently, best management practices are focussed on providing treatment measures for stormwater runoff at catchment outlets where separation of road and roof runoff is not found. In this context, it is important to find a common set of surrogate parameter relationships for road surfaces and roof surfaces to evaluate urban stormwater quality. Consequently DTN-TDS, TS-EC and TS-TTU relationships were identified as the common relationships which are capable of providing measurements of DTN and TS irrespective of the surface type...|$|E
