In late 1675, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> only fifteen, she met John Churchill, 10 years her senior, who {{fell in love with}} her.

The impact of preterm labour and other perinatal health problems is significant, both in human and financial terms; therefore the study of the physiological and regulatory changes which the uterus undergoes can be of enormous potential benefit. Here we briefly review the current state of knowledge, with an emphasis on the importance of changes in connectivity in the uterine smooth muscle cell network and on recent mathematical modelling work aimed at elucidating the role of spatial heterogeneity in this connected network...|$|R

His method was meticulous, involving {{a great deal of}} measuring and correction to create images that are not hyper real, but appear almost sculptural. Writing in 1990, Tim Wilcox said [...] "Uglow's staple is the traditional studio nude but set in relation to an artificial space contrived by the artist himself with geometrical markings and the odd prop used as if by a minimalist stage designer." [...] The measuring process was laborious and time-consuming to the point that Uglow himself joked that one model he began painting <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> engaged, <b>was</b> <b>still</b> painting <b>when</b> <b>she</b> got married and did not finish painting until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> divorced.|$|R

25|$|It was Carlock {{who gave}} Grandin {{the idea to}} build herself a 'hug box' (referred to as a 'squeeze machine' by Grandin) when she {{returned}} from her aunt's farm in Arizona in her {{senior year of high}} school. With Carlock's assistance, Grandin built her 'squeeze machine' at the age of 18 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> attending Mountain Country School. Carlock's supportive role in Grandin's life continued even after she left Mountain Country School. For example, when Grandin was facing criticism for her 'squeeze machine' at Franklin Pierce College, it was Carlock who suggested that Grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device. It was his constant guidance to Grandin to refocus her rigid obsessions with the 'squeeze machine' into a productive assignment that allowed this study undertaken by Grandin to be subsequently widely cited as evidence of Grandin's resourcefulness.|$|E
