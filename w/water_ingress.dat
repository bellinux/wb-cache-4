5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to <b>water</b> <b>ingress</b> into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E

Experimental results based on surface topography segmentation analysis and a model presented in this paper will be used to test the hypothesis that the major contributing defects to water vapour transmission rate are small numbers of large defects.

50|$|After {{the core}} of the Indus {{civilisation}} had decayed in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, Lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years. Its constant threats - tropical storms and floods - caused immense destruction, which destabilised the culture and ultimately caused its end. Topographical analysis also shows signs that at about the time of its demise, the region suffered from aridity or weakened monsoon rainfall. Thus the cause for the abandonment of the city may have been changes in the climate as well as natural disasters, as suggested by environmental magnetic records. Lothal is based upon a mound that was a salt marsh inundated by tide. Remote sensing and topographical studies published by Indian scientists in the Journal of the Indian Geophysicists Union in 2004 revealed an ancient, meandering river adjacent to Lothal, 30 km in length according to satellite imagery— an ancient extension of the northern river channel bed of a tributary of the Bhogavo river. Small channel widths (10 - 300 m) when compared to the lower reaches (1.2 - 1.6 km) suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal <b>waters</b> <b>ingressed</b> up to and beyond the city. Upstream elements of this river provided a suitable source of freshwater for the inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS) {{and magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) are used to measure water uptake in nylon 6 films. Based on the EIS data the uptake process is split into three stages. At first, during the first 3 h, the spectrum is mainly capacitive due to the dry bottom part of the film. The existence of a dry bottom part is confirmed by the MRI measurements. In the second stage EIS shows that small traces of water reach the substrate, whereas MRI still not detects water at the nylon/substrate interface. This demonstrates the sensitivity of EIS as water at the substrate is detected by EIS before MRI {{is able to do}} so. The last stage starts as the waterfront reaches the substrate and the amount of water in the nylon at the substrate increases. MRI shows that the bulk of the <b>water</b> <b>ingresses</b> into the nylon film as a sharp front. A simple capacitance model is able to link this ingressing front to the impedance as measured with EIS at high frequency. The detection of water breakthrough and interface processes by EIS illustrates the complementarity of the techniques. EIS is able to detect small traces of moisture reaching the substrate before the bulk amount of water does. MRI gives a better view on the overall water distribution during uptake. [...] -...|$|R

30|$|The {{problems}} encountered {{during the}} construction period are mainly {{related to the}} unexpected inflow of groundwater at some locations; predicting the location of <b>water</b> <b>ingresses</b> is often a difficult task (Huang and Lu 2007). To obtain a more accurate value of the inflow at a tunnel face or the area near it during tunnel excavation, the groundwater pressure in the tunnel working area needs to be determined. Then, the water inflow value can be accurately predicted using hydraulics theory. Groundwater pressure can usually be determined using seepage theory if the groundwater table and geological conditions are known which can indicate the head loss from water table to measuring point. Zhang (2006) presented a seepage load incremental theory for analyzing stress in a lining {{and its impact on}} the water inflow during the excavation process. Wang et al. (2008) proposed a theoretical model to estimate the water pressure on a lining under controlled drainage. Atkinson and Mair (1983), Shin et al. (2002), Yoo (2005) and Lee et al. (2007) draw the same conclusions using a numerical simulation. Other researchers focused on analytical solutions to calculate the pore water pressure to estimate the effective stress distribution at the tunnel perimeter (Fernández and Alvarez 1994). However, during the tunnel excavation process, the geological conditions are always unknown and change along the excavation axis, so it is hard to obtain an accurate loss of the pressure head. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a theoretical method to more accurately predict the groundwater pressure during the tunnel excavation process. First, the water inflow can be measured from an advanced borehole or grout-hole. Then, this value can be used to calculate the groundwater pressure through hydraulics theory and to forecast the water inrush that may occur at the tunnel working area so that suitable countermeasures can be presented.|$|R

40|$|Flexible {{photovoltaic}} {{films have}} been recently {{shown to have}} efficiencies {{comparable to those of}} solid Si based photovoltaics. Flexible PV films have significant advantages in terms of ease of manufacture by roll-to-roll (R 2 R) techniques and in easy building integration. A significant challenge is the protection of the flexible solar cells from <b>water</b> vapour <b>ingress,</b> which seriously reduces cell life and efficiency. Transparent barrier films are a possible solution to addressing the water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) challenge. Consequently thin barrier films such as those made from Al 2 O 3 are the subject of increasing research interest when used for the encapsulation of flexible PV modules. The film can be produced by several thin film deposition processes such as atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, micro-scale defects in the barrier film such as pinholes and particulate debris have been shown to have serious consequences in terms of WVTR. Our previous research has empirically shown that small defects (≤ 3 μm lateral dimension) were less significant in determining <b>water</b> vapour <b>ingress.</b> In contrast, larger defects (≥ 3 μm lateral dimension) have been shown to have a greater effect on the barrier functionality. The present paper illustrates the use of surface segmentation techniques to efficiently extract defect data from measured surface topography of barrier film sheets. Experimental results are presented where the defect information is correlated with the WVTR tests. A model is then presented to test the hypothesis that the major contributing defects to water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) are small numbers of large defects. The model presented in the paper shows excellent correlation with experimental results and provides a theoretical basis for the development of in process surface measurement for thin film R 2 R manufacture...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{specification}} of crushed concrete aggregates (CCA) is increasing, particularly for low-grade applications, where quality is of less importance. In higher value applications, such as structural concrete, {{further research is}} required to understand the effect of CCAs on mechanical and durability performance.
