25|$|For ψ to be a <b>wavelet</b> for the {{continuous}} <b>wavelet</b> transform (see there for exact statement), the mother <b>wavelet</b> must satisfy an admissibility criterion (loosely speaking, {{a kind of}} half-differentiability) {{in order to get}} a stably invertible transform.|$|E

25|$|In any {{discretised}} <b>wavelet</b> transform, {{there are}} only a finite number of <b>wavelet</b> coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the father <b>wavelet</b> φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap <b>wavelet.</b> Note that not every orthonormal discrete <b>wavelet</b> basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe <b>wavelet</b> admits no multiresolution analysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wavelet</b> {{theory is}} {{applicable}} to several subjects. All <b>wavelet</b> transforms {{may be considered}} forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete <b>wavelet</b> transforms use discrete-time filterbanks. These filter banks are called the <b>wavelet</b> and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a continuous <b>wavelet</b> transform (CWT) {{are subject to the}} uncertainty principle of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the scaleogram of a continuous <b>wavelet</b> transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete <b>wavelet</b> bases may be considered in the context of other forms of the uncertainty principle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wavelet</b> {{transforms}} {{are classified}} into discrete <b>wavelet</b> transforms (DWTs) and continuous <b>wavelet</b> transforms (CWTs). Note that both DWT and CWT are continuous-time (analog) transforms. They {{can be used}} to represent continuous-time (analog) signals. CWTs operate over every possible scale and translation whereas DWTs use a specific subset of scale and translation values or representation grid.|$|E

The corresponding decomposition and reconstruction algorithms utilize discrete spherical Fourier transforms. Numerical examples confirm the theoretical expectations. x 1. Introduction Traditionally, <b>wavelets</b> were tailored to problems on the Euclidean space IR d. However, in most applications one has to analyze functions defined on compact domains. In particular, in geophysics <b>wavelets</b> on the unit sphere S of IR 3 are of interest. There exist different approaches to the constructions of spherical <b>wavelets.</b> Having spherical coordinates in mind, the idea of using tensor [...] products of periodic <b>wavelets</b> and <b>wavelets</b> on the interval was suggested in [7]. Applying tensor [...] products of periodic exponential spline [...] <b>wavelets</b> and spline [...] <b>wavelets</b> on the interval, <b>wavelets</b> on S were constructed in [3]. Unfortunately, tensor [...] product <b>wavelets</b> can possess singular [...] ...|$|R
25|$|For the {{discrete}} <b>wavelet</b> transform, {{one needs}} {{at least the}} condition that the <b>wavelet</b> series is {{a representation of the}} identity in the space L2(R). Most constructions of discrete WT make use of the multiresolution analysis, which defines the <b>wavelet</b> by a scaling function. This scaling function itself is a solution to a functional equation.|$|E
25|$|For example, a <b>wavelet</b> {{could be}} created {{to have a}} {{frequency}} of Middle C and a short duration of roughly a 32nd note. If this <b>wavelet</b> were to be convolved with a signal created from the recording of a song, then the resulting signal would be useful for determining when the Middle C note was being played in the song. Mathematically, the <b>wavelet</b> will correlate with the signal if the unknown signal contains information of similar frequency. This concept of correlation {{is at the core}} of many practical applications of <b>wavelet</b> theory.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the {{difficulties}} {{associated with the}} Gibbs phenomenon can be ameliorated by using a smoother method of Fourier series summation, such as Fejér summation or Riesz summation, or by using sigma-approximation. Using a continuous <b>wavelet</b> transform, the <b>wavelet</b> Gibbs phenomenon never exceeds the Fourier Gibbs phenomenon. Also, using the discrete <b>wavelet</b> transform with Haar basis functions, the Gibbs phenomenon does not occur {{at all in the}} case of continuous data at jump discontinuities, and is minimal in the discrete case at large change points. In <b>wavelet</b> analysis, this is commonly referred to as the Longo phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Fractional <b>wavelet</b> {{transform}} (FRWT) is a {{generalization of}} the classical <b>wavelet</b> transform in the fractional Fourier transform domains.

25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the Fourier transform, in time-frequency analysis, one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals {{in a form that}} has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the short-time Fourier transform or fractional Fourier transform, or other functions to represent signals, as in <b>wavelet</b> transforms and chirplet transforms, with the <b>wavelet</b> analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the continuous <b>wavelet</b> transform.|$|E
30|$|The H-F {{transform}} is a {{two step}} process, {{beginning with a}} data transformation that noise-normalizes the counts. Once the data are transformed, a series of Haar <b>wavelets</b> are fit to the data. Haar <b>wavelets</b> can be efficiently implemented in software, and {{they are used to}} represent counts/intensity data, similar to a conventional statistical model. However, rather than a single function representing the data, numerous <b>wavelets</b> are fit to the data. These <b>wavelets</b> are sorted according to the noise component. The first <b>wavelets</b> fit to the data are smooth functions with almost no noise. Later <b>wavelets</b> contain successively more noise, and the final ones are almost exclusively noise. Adding all of the <b>wavelets</b> together results in a near-perfect reconstruction of the original image. However, the image can also be reconstructed by taking only a portion of the <b>wavelets.</b> In this study, only the first 75  % of the <b>wavelets</b> were used to reconstruct the image, and the result is an image with the noise components removed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Two-dimensional (2 -D) compactly supported, {{orthogonal}} <b>wavelets</b> and filter banks having linear phase are presented.

We show that imposing the requirement of linear phase {{in the case of}} order-factorable <b>wavelets</b> imposes a simple constraint on each of its polynomial order- 1 factors. We thus obtain a simple and complete method of constructing orthogonal order-factorable <b>wavelets</b> with linear phase. This method is exemplified by design in the case of four-band separable sampling. An interesting result that is similar to the one well-known in the one-dimensional (1 -D) case is obtained: Orthogonal order-factorable <b>wavelets</b> cannot be both continuous and have four-fold symmetry.
