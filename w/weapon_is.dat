5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> the Blades of Exile, {{replacing}} the Blades of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> a pair of blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung {{in a number of}} maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, SAWs {{are either}} carried with a {{maneuvering}} unit and fired while handheld, or positioned to remain stationary and provide covering fire for other units. The usual load of ammunition carried for the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> 1,000 rounds in five 200-round belts, although up to 500 extra rounds generally get loaded into 100-round soft pouches.|$|E
5000|$|... : Donated <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{previously}} {{used by the}} Afghan National Army, but the <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> later {{returned to}} Canada.|$|R
50|$|Toy <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> toys which imitate real <b>weapons,</b> but <b>are</b> {{designed}} {{for children to}} play with. Though some can be potentially hazardous, toy <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> generally not meant to cause bodily harm.|$|R
5000|$|A new stat for <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> [...] "weight", {{ranging from}} 0 (light) to 8 (unmovable). Heavyweight <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> very slow.|$|R
5|$|According to {{explanatory}} {{note to the}} proposal, it aims at utilisation of already existing specific conditions as regards firearms ownership in the Czech Republic (2.75% of adult population having concealed carry license) for security purposes {{as a reaction to}} current threats – especially isolated attacks against soft targets. While there is constitutional right to self-defense, its practical utilization without any <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> only illusory.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> the Blades of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World <b>Weapon</b> <b>is</b> not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E
5|$|Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter, {{in which}} the player assumes the role of Max Payne, but also plays as Mona Sax in a few levels. Initially, the player's <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> a 9mm pistol. As they progress, players access other weapons {{including}} other handguns, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and hand-thrown weapons. To move the game along, the player is told what the next objective is through Max's internal monologue, in which Max iterates what his next steps should be.|$|E
5000|$|Mega Man series: <b>Weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{earned from}} the Robot Masters/Mavericks upon {{defeating}} them. The <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> kept until {{the game is}} turned off (unless a password is used which can bring the player back to a point after the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> acquired) or when the game is completed.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted as}} army rifle for the Norwegian Army. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> in service until World War II.|$|R
50|$|Production of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{funded by}} a Swedish steel {{producer}} and banker (later weapons maker) named Thorsten Nordenfelt, who was working in London. The name of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> changed to the Nordenfelt gun. A plant producing the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> set up in England, with sales offices in London, and long demonstrations were conducted at several exhibitions. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the British Royal Navy, as an addition to their Gatling and Gardner guns.|$|R
5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with}} an L17A2 under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. The rifle has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). These weapons are usually equipped with iron sights or an optical SUSAT, although optical sights have been purchased to supplement these.|$|E
5|$|Zell's {{ultimate}} <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> named Ehrgeiz, directly referencing {{the game}} {{of the same name}} which came out around the same time Final Fantasy VIII did. Also, continuing the similarities to Tifa Lockhart of Final Fantasy VII, Zell has a limit break called Dolphin Blow as does Tifa, Zell's final limit break is My Final Heaven, while Tifa's was called just Final Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Zong Hui noted several {{concepts}} that were scrapped during development. Yang was originally planned as a boss character but was ultimately replaced by Chun-Li. His special <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> still {{included in the}} game via cheat codes. Zong Hui also wanted to include alternate costumes for boss characters and a second playable character from the Street Fighter franchise.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the coaxial weapon in the American M60 tank. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> evaluated by both the US Army and the US Naval weapon center, who reported that the performance of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> outstanding during all phases of testing. However, neither chose to adopt the weapon.|$|R
25|$|The {{theory of}} peace without <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> {{as old as}} {{philosophy}} and human consciousness. This theory holds that <b>weapons</b> per se <b>are</b> a threat to peace, and a removal of all <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> the way to everlasting peace.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|In Episode One players {{make their}} way through a linear series of levels and {{encounter}} various enemies and allies. The gameplay is broken up between combat-oriented challenges and physics-based puzzles. Episode One integrates tutorial-like tasks into the story to familiarize the player with new gameplay mechanics without breaking immersion. A head-up display appears on the screen to display the character's health, energy, and ammunition. Throughout the course of the game, the player accesses new weapons and ammunition that are used to defend the character from enemy forces. Unlike in Half-Life 2, where Gordon's initial <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> the crowbar, Gordon first acquires the Gravity Gun, which plays {{a crucial role in the}} game by allowing the player to use physics to manipulate objects at a distance in both combat and puzzle-solving scenarios.|$|E
5|$|In Escape from Butcher Bay, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Richard B. Riddick and {{attempts}} {{to break out of}} Butcher Bay prison. The game incorporates elements from video game genres such as first-person shooter, adventure and stealth, and is played primarily from a first-person perspective, though the camera switches to a third-person perspective during certain scenes. Unlike many first-person shooters, the game contains no head-up display; on-screen cues are limited to flashes when a new <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> selected, and small, white boxes that display the player character's health when damage is taken. Health can be replenished in designated areas throughout the game. By finding cigarette packs hidden in levels, the player can unlock concept art and video files.|$|E
50|$|More <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{supplied}} {{throughout the}} uprising, {{and some were}} captured from the Germans. Some <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> handmade by the resistance; sometimes such weapons worked, other times they jammed repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|Native Americans used many {{variations}} of striking <b>weapons.</b> These <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> mainly used for melee combat with other tribes. In some cases these <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> thrown for long range attacks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> first deployed, but not used, during Operation Allied Force when NATO {{entered the}} Kosovo War. Sensor-fused <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> first fired in combat during the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq.|$|R
5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} {{platformer}} with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items. Pit's primary <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows {{that can be}} upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases {{the range of the}} arrows. These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health bar {{at the end of a}} level if enough points were collected.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> the Blades of Chaos: {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Mahlon J. Gallager, who licensed the design to Richardson and Overman of Philadelphia for production. On 31 August 1861 the first <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{sold to the}} Army.|$|R
50|$|Space <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> used {{in space}} warfare. They include weapons that can attack space systems in orbit (i.e. anti-satellite weapons), attack targets {{on the earth}} from space or disable {{missiles}} travelling through space. In {{the course of the}} militarisation of space, such <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> developed mainly by the contesting superpowers during the Cold War, and some remain under development today. Space <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> also a central theme in military science fiction and sci-fi video games.|$|R
50|$|About 14% of Russian {{chemical}} <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{stored in}} Shchuchye and, {{with the help}} of the US-supported Nunn-Lugar program, a new facility to destroy these chemical <b>weapons</b> <b>was</b> opened there in May 2009.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile Captain Archer, {{accompanied}} by Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Sato, {{and a team}} of MACOs, enters the vortex created by the Xindi weapon. During the pursuit, a recovering Sato is pushed by Archer to decipher Degra's schematics. Again Archer is suddenly pulled into the future by Temporal Agent Daniels, this time to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, but Archer is again uninterested. Arriving near Earth, Archer receives an unexpected transmission from Commander Shran, who engages and then destroys the Reptilian ship. In the chaos, Archer and his team are able to beam aboard the weapon. A fierce fire-fight ensues, and as Archer and Sato try to disable the weapon, Commander Dolim attempts to stop them. He fails and the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action-platformer that shares many {{similarities}} {{with its}} NES counterparts. The player, as Mega Man, {{is able to}} choose among four stages to complete in whatever order desired. Each stage contains various enemies to blast through and obstacles to overcome, such as leaping between disappearing blocks over deadly spikes and bottomless pits. Mega Man's primary <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's health or extra lives. At {{the end of every}} stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon. Each boss is weak to another's weapon, allowing the player to strategize the order in which they are beaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Majora's Mask expands on that of Ocarina of Time; it {{retains the}} concept of dungeon puzzles and ocarina songs, and introduces character transformations and a three-day cycle. As in previous installments, Link can perform basic actions such as walking, running and limited jumping, and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles. Link's main <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> the sword, which can be upgraded throughout the game. Other weapons and items are available—Link can block or reflect attacks with a shield, stun enemies by throwing Deku Nuts, attack from a distance with a bow and arrows, and destroy obstacles and damage enemies with bombs. He can also latch onto objects or paralyze enemies with the Hookshot. Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows or spin attacks, {{and the use of}} special items.|$|E
40|$|The {{authorized}} {{international trade}} in small arms and light <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> diverse and dynamic, affecting every {{region of the world}} and all levels of society. Recreational hunters and other private individuals buy millions of imported rifles, shotguns, and rounds of ammunition each year. Millions of additional foreign-sourced <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> procured by military and law enforcement agencies worldwide. Most of these <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> used in accordance with national an...|$|R
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{refitted}} in 1859 (T.59) {{and again}} in 1867 (T.67) with a Milbank-Amsler receiver system to convert it to a breech loader. Some <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> also retrofitted with rifled barrels in the 1860s.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} classes of weapons: melee weapons, {{short-range}} weapons, long-range weapons, and support fire <b>weapons.</b> Melee <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> used at melee range {{and have a}} tendency to strike the body part of its target. Tonfas and rods are examples of melee <b>weapons.</b> Short-range <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> used at close range and deal damage to all parts of a target. Machine guns and shotguns are examples of short-range <b>weapons.</b> Long-range <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> that have long firing ranges and are ideal for avoiding counterattacks. Bazookas are examples of long-range weapons. Support fire <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> indirect fire weapons; they can never be counterattacked, but have limited ammunition supply and minimum firing ranges. Missile launchers are examples of support fire weapons. Lastly, shields can be equipped on wanzers to absorb some of the damage taken from incoming attacks.|$|R
