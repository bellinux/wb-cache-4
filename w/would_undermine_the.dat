5|$|The Shafi'i {{school of}} thought accepts qiyas as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, {{considered}} it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to qiyas. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the Qur'an and sunnah. According to Shafi'i, if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system.|$|E
5|$|The mid-term {{elections}} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor {{with the administration}} over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans {{in the rural areas}} of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.|$|E

5|$|When Adolf Hitler rose to power, Joseph Goebbels became Minister of Propaganda and {{banned the}} film in Germany, {{suggesting}} that the film <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French-language and German-language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release. The sequel The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960) was also directed by Lang. Modern reception {{of the film is}} favorable with critics, while the film has influenced filmmakers including Claude Chabrol and Artur Brauner.|$|E
5|$|In the Norwegian Government's {{internal}} evaluation, FFI {{stated that}} as long as regular inspections were carried out, there was little chance of military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that if the right equipment was installed, the ground station could be used to listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment. Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it would establish an unwanted precedent and <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian sovereignty of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The US, the UK, {{and most}} other NATO {{countries}} opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. The US/UK side claimed that this <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> authority of the alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and {{could do the same}} in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.|$|E

5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May, the British {{government}} {{continued to}} state that it would provide only logistical and technical support to UNAMSIL, but was privately exploring its options for a military deployment. The United Kingdom had a greater level of political involvement in Sierra Leone {{than in any other}} African country and, with the country's stability deteriorating, it was reluctant to see that investment wasted. In addition, an estimated 1,000 entitled personnel were in Sierra Leone, and the government feared for their safety. Academics have since suggested that the credibility of UNAMSIL and future UN peacekeeping operations would have been at stake had the mission in Sierra Leone been allowed to fail. The British Armed Forces were not as widely deployed in 2000 as they were to be later in the decade. The British Army had two brigades serving with NATO in the Balkans, and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had ongoing commitments to Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, and elsewhere, but the armed forces—particularly units threatened by proposed cuts to the defence budget—were keen to participate in an operation. Senior officers thus advised the government that an operation in Sierra Leone was feasible. Over the following days, there was debate within the British government as to what the aims of a military deployment to Sierra Leone would be. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advocated a full-scale intervention to assist UNAMSIL, arguing that a non-combatant evacuation operation would not be sufficient and <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> UN, but the MoD believed that the armed forces would be unable to sustain a larger-scale operation.|$|E

25|$|The next step, wrote Kahn, was {{to impart}} unity and {{cohesion}} {{by means of}} a union of related consonants, or the repetition of similar vowel sounds (assonance). Poets were thus free to create novel and complex rhythms, with, if so desired, inversions that destroyed the beat of the strophe. As Kahn noted, this was shocking because traditionally it was the regularity of the strophe that gave the reader meaning. Symbolist concepts vacated the metronome-like symmetry and introduced liberty, flexibility and elasticity. Each was to find her own rhythmic force. The classicists feared that the dismantling of meter by the decadent Symbolist 'barbarians' <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> French language, and thus attack the very foundations of social order.|$|E

Combining their skills, Casco and Resck used international pressure, and Roberto Paredes led a raid by the JPDH on the Palacio de los López, to force the closure of the camp. The two groups worked together, though some members of the JPDH thought the privilege accorded to Casco because of her family position made her both less willing to take risks and unable to relate to issues of the masses; conversely, she felt that the subversive ideologies of the radicals within JPDH <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> work of the Commission.|$|E
25|$|Authorities {{claimed that}} the assassin had been a teenage boy from South Waziristan. They claimed to have proof that the attack had been masterminded by Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency concurred that this was probable; Mehsud {{believed}} that Bhutto's pro-American and secularist agenda <b>would</b> <b>undermine</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani Taliban's control of South Waziristan and hinder the growth of Sunni Islamist radicalism. Mehsud denied the accusation, with al-Qaeda spokesman Mustafa Abu al-Yazid instead claiming that his organisation had carried out the killing {{on the order of}} its second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The PPP accused the government of a cover-up, with several PPP figures claiming that Bhutto had been killed by a sniper linked to the intelligence agencies. Within Pakistan there was also public speculation that the attack might have been masterminded by India, or the United States. Musharraf agreed to invite Britain's Scotland Yard to investigate the assassination. Requests for the body to be exhumed for an autopsy were rejected by Zardari.|$|E
