5|$|Like other {{multiplayer}} Xbox 360 titles, Halo 3 uses {{a customized}} version of TrueSkill ranking system for its matchmaking on a per-playlist basis. A linear {{measure of a}} player's experience with the matchmade portion {{of the game and}} each particular playlist is also tracked (denoted as EXP). To help players have an enjoyable time online, several peace-of-mind features are implemented <b>within</b> <b>easy</b> <b>reach,</b> such as avoid/feedback options on a player's service record, as well as voice chat mute straight from the in-game scoreboard. Like Halo 2, Halo 3 supports downloadable content and updates.|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location <b>within</b> <b>easy</b> <b>reach</b> of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands and Belgium {{wished to}} remain neutral {{and refused to}} allow the RAF to {{establish}} bases, to fly deeper into Germany. They also forbade overflying by British bombers to and from Germany. After the outbreak of war, the French refused to allow RAF bombers to bomb German cities from French airfields. The French felt secure behind the Maginot Line, but their air force did not possess the modern bombers to deliver a pre-emptive strike against the Luftwaffe. French fighter forces were not yet ready for an all out defensive campaign against the Germans either. A fear of retaliation was the main French reason. The only recourse was to fly missions directly from Britain and only ports or coastal cities in northern Germany were <b>within</b> <b>easy</b> <b>reach.</b> This state of affairs suited the British, in particular, the Admiralty.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the decline}} in burials from an already low level, rising land values in the post war years meant that the LNC was a {{valuable}} and successful company. In the 1940s it bought {{out a number of}} other firms of funeral directors, particularly those catering for the expanding and prosperous suburbs of south west London <b>within</b> <b>easy</b> <b>reach</b> of Brookwood by road. The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for return tickets for same-day travel from London to Brookwood and back. By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Summary: CycSim is a web {{application}} dedicated to in silico experiments with genome-scale metabolic models coupled to {{the exploration of}} knowledge from BioCyc and KEGG. Specifically, CycSim supports the design of knockout experiments: simulation of growth phenotypes of single or multiple gene deletions mutants on specified media, comparison of these predictions with experimental phenotypes and direct visualization of both on metabolic maps. The web interface is designed for simplicity, putting constraint-based modelling techniques <b>within</b> <b>easier</b> <b>reach</b> of biologists. CycSim also functions as an online repository of genome-scale metabolic models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the status and}} prospects of the global, nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament regime. It finds that although the immediate crises over the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs are serious, they are also likely manageable. Far more problematic for the regime’s long-term survival is the possible deterioration of the international security environment resulting from shifts in the global balance of power, severe climate change, and nuclear weapons retentionism by the current nuclear-armed states. Additionally, the accelerating spread of nuclear technology and expertise threatens to put nuclear weapons <b>within</b> <b>easier</b> <b>reach</b> of more states. Overall, the prospects for the regime remain uncertain and the window for action on nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament may be beginning to close. States should act now, and with resolve, to mitigate risks and to strengthen the regime in preparation for more challenging times ahead...|$|R
