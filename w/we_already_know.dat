25|$|Bottom-up approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if <b>we</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|E

25|$|Wandering {{alone in}} the forest, the empress (she is given no name in this romance) lies tired and {{exhausted}} at a spring one evening and falls asleep. In the morning, as the dawn chorus begins, an ape suddenly emerges from the forest and steals away one of her babies. Then a lioness appears and takes away the other in its mouth. The woman is distraught! She assumes that she is being punished for her sins and undertakes to journey to the Holy Land, so she travels to the Aegean Sea and takes a ship bound for Jerusalem. On the way, the crew stop at an island to take on fresh water and encounter a lioness suckling a human baby. The empress goes ashore and finds her own baby being treated by the lioness as her cub (a griffin – <b>we</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> – had snatched away the lioness shortly after it stole the child {{and took it to}} this island, where the lioness had killed it). The empress returns to the ship with her child and the lioness follows. They all arrive in Jerusalem where the King recognises the lady for who she is, names her little boy Octavian and allows her to stay, with her child and her lioness, in wealth and comfort.|$|E

Mendelson felt [...] "this [...] a fine final trailer, teasing what <b>we</b> <b>already</b> <b>know,</b> hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know" [...] adding, [...] "Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May.

He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things <b>we</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> without telling us much more." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because it gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters <b>we</b> <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E

Turned out I was wrong, but he was still a class A jerk". Of the episode she said, [...] "The suspects pile up so fast and furious, that it's difficult to figure out the perpetrator until they are ready to tell you. She added that she had [...] "much respect for that method of storytelling". She continued, [...] "There is nothing I enjoy less than watching the crime being committed in the first minutes of a show and then watching the respective squad of police and detectives miss clues <b>we</b> <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> Body of Proof isn't afraid to allow the audience to use their intellect". Pavlica also enjoyed the relationship between Megan and Lacey, calling it [...] "heart wrenching" [...] saying that she had a tear in eye due to the scenes. [...] "I'm enjoying how the writers are piecing together the strained relationship they had, in a realistic, no holds barred way". However, Pavica was afraid to [...] "jinx" [...] the show, as she had [...] "no idea of Body of Proofs place in the ratings", adding that she was [...] "nervous" [...] as it is up against shows such as The Good Wife and Parenthood.|$|E
