Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E

Roxas refuses to return with Axel and defeats him before merging with Sora. Axel later begins acting {{on his own and}} kidnaps Kairi, but Saïx takes her under Xemnas's orders. Axel later finds Sora in a pathway to the World That Never Was and chooses to fight the Nobodies with him. Outnumbered, Axel {{performs}} a suicide attack to save Sora, and using the last of his strength to open the entrance to the World That Never Was. When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to do, Axel admits he wanted to see Roxas.|$|E

25|$|Before the assassination, the British {{intelligence}} services identified Talaat in Stockholm {{where he had}} gone for a few days. The British intelligence first planned to apprehend him in Berlin where {{he was planning to}} return, but then changed its mind because it feared the complications this would create in Germany. Another view in British intelligence was that Talaat should be apprehended by the Royal Navy at sea while returning from Scandinavia by ship. In the end, it was decided to let him return to Berlin, find out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to accomplish with his activities abroad, and to establish direct contact with him before giving the final verdict. This was achieved with the help of Aubrey Herbert.|$|E

On October 17 he suffered his first defeat, a six-round decision to Victor Lozoya. Over the next six bouts, he went 4–2. Following that, his financial situation dramatically improved (which is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to achieve early on in his career) and from there he went 28–2–1, with notable wins over Alfred Ankamah, Juan Soberanes, future World Middleweight Champion Sergio Gabriel Martinez, Buck Smith, David Kamau and Frankie Randall, a former World Light Welterweight Champion who became the first man to beat Julio César Chávez in 91 fights.|$|E

World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E
2500|$|The Wish Maker {{has been}} often {{compared}} with Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner, {{due to its}} similar tone to Hosseini's tale which depicts the pre-revolutionary Afghanistan with warmth and humour despite the tense political undercurrent. Sethi has commented that he considered {{the name of the}} book, The Wish Maker, [...] "so important" [...] because it describes [...] "to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to say".

He made good his promise the next day and, after overwhelming all the Persians who were game enough to fight him, he commenced punching the air, just to show that [...] "he had all those blows left if anyone wanted to take him on." [...] However, the boorishness and gluttony of athletes was a topos of Greek comedy and even a hero like Hercules was the butt of many jokes.|$|E

After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, [...] "That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!", referring {{to the fact that the}} Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1.

2500|$|Ozu {{told me to}} come [...] in {{the room}} [...] and circle around. So I did as I was told, but of course it wasn’t good enough. After the third take, Ozu {{approved}} it… The reason [...] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. Come to think of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped me do it.|$|E
2500|$|Everybody was {{influenced}} {{at the time}} by Arturo Toscanini - {{it was easy to}} understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to do: you didn't need any reference to spiritual dimension. There was a certain order in the way the music was presented. With Toscanini I never felt anything spiritual. With Furtwängler on the other hand, I understood that there I was confronted by something completely different: metaphysics, transcendence, the relationship between sounds and sonorities [...] Furtwängler was not only a musician, he was a creator [...] What happens to those who don't understand the manifold variety of musical performance? Who are unable to hear that famous astral octave because they are deaf to music? Then their integration is related only to a part of a musical score, to the least important one, the raw material. But that's precisely what music is not about [...] Then you find each tempo too slow. Because the slowness or fastness are determined by the complexity of these musical manifestations. Furtwängler had the ear for it: not the physical ear, but the spiritual ear that captures these parallel movements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} on Ashton's Ondine {{is that it}} has some very good things in it – and this is true; as is the implication that it is otherwise unsuccessful, not least because the music (which greatly disappointed Ashton himself) largely fails, except in the storm of Act II and the divertissements of Act III. According to many critics, the music did not suit Ashton [...] "who had been hoping for music as [...] "radiant" [...] as the Mediterranean from which its heroine was born". Yet the music does seem to fit its watery theme well: there are some beautiful passages to Ondine’s Act 3 [...] "swimming" [...] solo where the music seems thin and transparent as watercolour, and entirely suited to this sketch of the sea. The ballet is also a mixture of both the 19th and the 20th century, for the plot is quintessentially romantic while the music and choreography are more modern. Although it bore all the marks of Ashton's familiarly gentle, classically oriented manner, it discarded the classical ballet conventions that appear in such Ashton successes as Cinderella and Sylvia. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to suggest, says Ashton, was [...] "the ebb and flow of the sea: I aimed at an unbroken continuity of dance, which would remove the distinction between aria and recitative." [...] As a result, Ondine offered few pyrotechnics, gained its effects instead through sinuous mass movements in which the undulation of arm and body suggested forests of sea plants stirring to unseen tides. The sense of submarine fantasy was reinforced by Stage Designer Lila de Nobili's fine scenery: a castle of mist and fruitfulness, shadowy crags and waterfalls, aqueous skies streaked pink and green.|$|E

His voice is very loud, harsh and deep, with an incomprehensible bear-like growl between word and sentences.

5000|$|Ptolemy {{states in}} the letter that, [...] "this {{division}} of the law (that is, god's own law) was established neither by the perfect god, as we have taught, nor surely by the devil -which {{it would be wrong}} to say- then the establisher of this division is distinct from them. And <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the craftsman and maker of this universe or world and the things within it." [...] This excerpt reflects Ptolemy's gnostic view that the god that created the world is not the Perfect God, but rather an inferior god who incorrectly believed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the one true God, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to convey to Flora.|$|R
5000|$|It was in Art and Illusion that he {{introduced}} {{the ideas of}} 'schemata', 'making and matching', 'correction' and 'trial and error' influenced by 'conjecture and refutation', in Popper's philosophy of science. In Gombrich's view, the artist compares <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has drawn or painted with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to draw/paint, and by a 'feedback loop' gradually corrects the drawing/painting to look more like <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> seeing. The process does not start from scratch, however. Each artist inherits '"schemata" [...] that designate reality by force of convention'. These schemata, plus the techniques and works of previous masters, are the starting points from which the artist begins her own process of trial and error.|$|R
