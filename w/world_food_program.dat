5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Program</b> provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNASA {{provides}} daily satellite {{remote sensing}} observations {{on a wide}} variety of environmental parameters at the global scale, including rainfall, temperature, vegetation health, ocean productivity and soil moisture conditions. Many organizations and individuals use this data to better understand the Earth system using models and diagnose the impact of climate on agricultural productivity. Weather related extreme events trigger food insecurity by reducing the supply of food and incomes of households working in the agriculture sector. Models and other ecosystem-based assessments can be used to inform decisions regarding food security and human health outcomes of changes in access to food. In this talk, I provide a description of the various monitoring products that have been developed by the US Agency for International Development and <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Program's</b> systems to monitor food production in food insecure regions, along with graphics and explanations as to how the products are used. Information on local food market prices and food affordability, nutrition outcomes, school attendance, the use of safety nets and other ancillary data are brought together with remote sensing information to inform food security. Satellite data is increasingly used to assess the amount of food grown globally, particularly in a new system entitled ‘Global Agriculture Geo-monitoring Initiative (GEOGLAM). The system seeks to harmonize production assessments across nations and regions using satellite data to ensure a comprehensive and transparent assessment of how much food will be available for sale in international markets every month. As the climate changes, improved integration of social and economic food security indicators with climate observations from satellites will become increasingly important to ensure food security for all...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The design of the United Nations (UN) <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Program's</b> (WFP) internal controls related to delivery and monitoring of food assistance generally reflects principles for internal controls and enterprise risk management developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). WFP has developed an internal control framework that has, like the COSO internal control framework, five components: internal environment, risk management, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. However, the design of some of WFP's controls has weaknesses that could expose WFP to risks such as waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, WFP's Executive Board oversight is limited, {{and it does not}} fully utilize the WFP Audit Committee to assist in overseeing the effectiveness of WFP's risk management and internal control processes. Also, WFP has designed risk management policies but has not developed detailed guidance to instruct staff in addressing risks, especially at the country level where WFP is most vulnerable. Additionally, as recommended by COSO, WFP has established control activities that address risks to its objectives [...] for example, policies and procedures designed to help ensure tracking of food assistance from delivery at the port-of-entry to distribution to beneficiaries. However, weaknesses in the design of its commodity tracking system, including lack of capacity to track food in implementing partners' custody, limit WFP's ability to account for all food in these partners' custody. Further, WFP has developed detailed policies for monitoring distribution of food assistance to beneficiaries, in line with COSO principles, but has not provided guidance that instructs staff to consider risk when determining needed levels of monitoring, including in high-risk areas where WFP staff have limited access. ...|$|R

On April 21, 2015, Allen brought together key leaders in the Ebola fight at the Ebola Innovation Summit in San Francisco. The summit aimed to share key learnings and reinforce the need for continued action and support to bring the number of Ebola cases down to zero. As part of his ongoing commitment to end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Paul Allen Foundation partnered with the United States Department of State and MRIGlobal to develop a new first of its kind medevac biocontainment units. These units will be used by the U.S. State Department to help safely evacuate healthcare workers who might fall ill to infectious diseases such as Ebola.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Program</b> prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E
5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Program</b> (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E

40|$|Nearly one {{in three}} {{children}} {{in the developing world}} is malnourished. Poor nutrition contributes to one out of two deaths (53 %) associated with infectious diseases among children aged under five in developing countries. Using data from the 2005 <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Program’s</b> (WFP) Livelihood Vulnerability and Nutritional Assessment of Rural Kassala and Red Sea State this study examines the impact of female headed households and maternal education on malnutrition in children 6 - 59 months old. The dependent variable investigated in this study is moderate to severe wasting or less than - 2 weight for height Z-score, also known as global acute malnutrition (GAM). ^ The study population consisted of 450 households in Kassala State and Red Sea State, Sudan. A total of 900 children 6 - 59 months of age were part of the households sampled from these states and one child per household (773 children) was randomly chosen for the analysis along with the child’s mother. Results of the study found that 18 percent of children between 6 - 59 months of age had GAM/wasting. Maternal education, main source of water, and income were strongly related to wasting. Gender of head of household was not found to have a significant relationship with GAM/wasting. Mothers with at least primary education were much less likely to have malnourished children, even after controlling for income and environmental conditions. Children in households with unsafe sources of water were 2. 6 more likely to have wasting than those with piped in/tube wells as their main source of water. For every increase of 100 dinar in a household, the children in the household are approximately two-thirds times (. 662) less likely to be wasted. ^ The results of this study support the alternate hypothesis that there is an association between maternal education on wasting of children 6 - 59 months old. The results do not, however, support the alternate hypothesis that there is an association between gender of head of household on wasting of children 6 - 59 months old. Better understanding of the association of wasting and other measures of malnutrition with maternal education levels can program managers and other health officials to target important nutritional and non-nutritional interventions. ...|$|R
