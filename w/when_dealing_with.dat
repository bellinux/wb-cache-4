In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize {{from day one}} without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

5|$|Many ancient civilizations {{observed}} astronomical bodies, {{often the}} Sun and Moon, to determine times, dates, and seasons. The first calendars {{may have been}} created during the last glacial period, by hunter-gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and bones to track the phases of the moon or the seasons. Stone circles, such as England's Stonehenge, were built {{in various parts of}} the world, especially in Prehistoric Europe, and are thought to have been used to time and predict seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or solstices. As those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history, little is known of their calendars or timekeeping methods. Methods of sexagesimal timekeeping, now common in both Western and Eastern societies, are first attested nearly 4,000years ago in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system <b>when</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> calendars to produce a 360-day year.|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties <b>when</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E
