5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue and devotion to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, <b>which</b> <b>lost</b> control {{of the national government}} in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party.|$|E

6000|$|... 21. The gradual {{diminution}} in rank {{beneath the}} Apolline leaf, {{takes place in}} others {{by the loss of}} {{one or more of the}} qualities above named. The Apolline leaf, I said, is strong, lustrous, full in its green, rich in substance, simple in form. The inferior leaves are those <b>which</b> have <b>lost</b> strength, and become thin, like paper; <b>which</b> have <b>lost</b> lustre, and become dead by roughness of surface, like the nettle,--(an Apolline leaf may become dead by bloom, like the olive, yet not lose beauty); <b>which</b> have <b>lost</b> colour and become feeble in green, as in the poplar, or crudely bright, like rice; <b>which</b> have <b>lost</b> substance and softness, and have nothing to give in scent or nourishment; or become flinty or spiny; finally, <b>which</b> have <b>lost</b> simplicity, and become cloven or jagged. Many of these losses are partly atoned for by gain of some peculiar loveliness. Grass and moss, and parsley and fern, have each their own delightfulness; yet they are all of inferior power and honour, compared to the Apolline leaves.|$|R

The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York.
