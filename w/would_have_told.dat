It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

25|$|Numismatists have {{sometimes}} tried to discern a very rigid system of organisation {{in the late}} Anglo-Saxon coinage: one, Michael Dolley, believed that until the death of Cnut in 1035, each type lasted six years, {{with a few exceptions}} – such as the Last Small Cross type at the end of Æthelred’s reign – lasting longer under very unusual conditions. Some features seem to support this belief, at least for the earlier period. Certain changes of type apparently coincided with datable historic events: no coins of the Helmet type survive from the mint of Wilton, for instance, whereas no coins of the preceding Long Cross type are known from nearby Salisbury, but moneyers with the same names as those from Wilton started to operate there in the Helmet type. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1003 Wilton was sacked by Vikings and the inhabitants retreated to Salisbury, and {{it is likely that the}} change of type coincided with this event. However, there are a number of difficulties with reconstructing such a fixed framework. Not all types are as well represented in the surviving material, and it is clear that this is not always simply a result of a few large hoards distorting our view. There are a number of very small and rare types which were certainly never meant to become fully fledged issues, though some bear a clear relationship to them. Examples from the reign of Æthelred II include the Benediction Hand type and the Intermediate Small Cross type, as well as the famous Agnus Dei type: a unique and fascinating issue on which the king’s portrait and the reverse cross are replaced with, respectively, the Lamb of God and the Holy Dove. The exact context for the production of this very rare coinage is unclear (eighteen specimens survive, as of November 2008): it was only struck at smaller mints, mostly in the midlands, either as an abortive main issue or as a special religious coinage for some specific purpose or occasion. Although the dating is unclear, it may be associated with the Eynsham gathering and the Penitential Edict of 1009. But the difficulties with the sexennial theory are not restricted to smaller, rarer types. The Second Hand type of Æthelred, for example, was not much different in appearance from its predecessor, raising the question of how easily people <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> it and the old coinage apart. More importantly, only minuscule numbers of the type survive from more northerly mints such as Lincoln and York which, in the rest of the period, were some of the most productive in the kingdom. It is possible that the Second Hand type represents a continuation of the First Hand type, which may have run on rather longer than six years as part of a mechanism that did envisage changes of type, but not necessarily on a strict sexennial basis.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Our Friends in the North, Flannery {{proposed}} a [...] "kind of prequel" [...] to the serial under the title of Our Friends in the South. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{the story of the}} Jarrow March. Although the BBC initially took up the project, it did not progress to script stage and was eventually abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Some reports however {{indicate}} that the legend was not seriously accepted: Carlyle suggests one near-eyewitness French account amounted to [...] "not a recantation of an impudent amazing falsehood, but to some vague faint murmur or whimper of admission {{that it is probably}} false". Captain Diaz de Soria relates the story, probably apocryphal, that in 1840, the Prince of Joinville, while decorating the purported last survivor of Vengeur, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him [...] "we do this for the legend, my good man: nations, after all, live only of legends". In 1857, Guérin wrote [...] "one wonders how, after that, history could remain so credulous".|$|E

500|$|Livingstone faced further {{criticism}} {{following a}} television appearance {{in which he}} stated that the perpetrators of the 2005 London bombings carried out their actions as retribution for UK involvement in the Iraq War. In March 2016, Livingstone again courted controversy by comparing a hedge fund manager's £16,800 donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis to [...] "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group"; it subsequently emerged that Livingstone himself had received £8,000 from a Bermuda-based hedge fund called Meditor for a speaking engagement, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. Livingstone responded that rather than [...] "double standards" [...] it was [...] "different standards", he was paid for a speaking engagement where he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the room {{of the need for}} the City to invest more in the economy, which he felt was distinct from taking a political donation from a hedge fund manager.|$|E
500|$|Sony {{received}} {{criticism for}} canceling the wide release. Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote {{that it was}} an [...] "unprecedented defeat on American turf", but that [...] "North Korea will find that their bullying edict will haunt them." [...] In the Capital and Gizmodo suggested the cancellation caused a Streisand effect, whereby the attempt to remove or censor a work has the unintended consequence of publicizing it more widely. In a press conference, U.S. President Barack Obama said that though he was sympathetic to Sony's need to protect employees, he thought Sony had [...] "made a mistake. We cannot have a society in which some dictator in some place can start imposing censorship in the United States. I wish they'd spoken to me first. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them: do not get into the pattern in which you are intimidated." ...|$|E
500|$|A single-player story {{revolving}} around three lead protagonists {{was one of}} Grand Theft Auto Vs earliest design objectives. Garbut felt that such a deviation from the gameplay's core structure was a risk, and recalled team concern that a departure from Grand Theft Autos traditional, single lead character set-up [...] "might backfire". Early game conceptualisations <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> three separate stories through different protagonists. Later, Grand Theft Auto IVs stories inspired the concept that story trajectories would meet throughout the game. Eventually, the concept evolved into three interconnected stories that intertwined through the missions. According to Benzies, the team made the multiple character formula [...] "integral {{to the structure of}} the gameplay as well as the narrative". Houser opined that Grand Theft Auto V is their [...] "strongest plotted game because the characters are so intertwined" [...] and that the [...] "meeting points [...] are very exciting".|$|E

500|$|Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided {{the grieving}} process. He commented, [...] "you {{have to get}} back on the horse. You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything. I'm happy to have walked away with my life after the {{situation}} I was thrown into. But, I mean, what do you do? I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." [...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer. He denied making the comments and apologized, although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the [...] "master of lies".|$|E
500|$|As {{a prayer}} tablet {{placed on a}} pier was a {{distinctive}} trait of pilgrimage churches, Harbison sees the panel as partly concerned with the phenomenon of pilgrimage. This type of tablet contained specific prayers whose recitation {{in front of a}} particular image or in the church was believed to attract an indulgence, or remission of time in Purgatory. The statue of the Virgin and Child in the niche behind Mary's left shoulder might represent such an image, whereas the inscription of a Nativity hymn around the lost frame, ending in ETCET, i.e. [...] "etcetera", <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the viewer to recite the whole hymn, perhaps for an indulgence. The purpose of the picture, therefore, may have been to represent and bring the act of pilgrimage to a domestic setting. This would have been attractive to Philip the Good who, though he made many pilgrimages in person, is recorded as paying van Eyck to perform one on his behalf in 1426, apparently an acceptable practice in Late Medieval celestial accounting.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.|$|E

As the flight had taken off late, they had not picked up the radio message broadcast by Prestwick airfield informing them of this.

2500|$|The Lauda {{aircraft}} was traveling {{at a high}} speed when the thrust reversers deployed, causing the pilots to lose control of the aircraft. James R. Chiles, author of Inviting Disaster, said, [...] "the point here is not that a thorough test <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the pilots Thomas J. Welch and Josef Thumer what to do. A thrust reverser deploying in flight {{might not have been}} survivable, anyway. But a thorough test would have informed the FAA and Boeing that thrust reversers deploying in midair was such a dangerous occurrence that Boeing needed to install a positive lock that would prevent such an event." [...] As a result of their findings during the investigation process of Lauda Flight 004, additional safety features such as mechanical positive locks were mandated to prevent thrust reverser deployment in flight.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, O'Neal {{said that}} Bryant {{should have won}} the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, which was awarded to Dirk Nowitzki. During the offseason, Bryant was [...] "beyond furious" [...] at reports from a Laker insider that Bryant had insisted O'Neal be traded from the Lakers. [...] Bryant {{reported}} that Buss said, [...] "I {{am not going to}} re-sign Shaq. I am not about to pay him $30 million a year or $80 million over three years ... His body is breaking down, and I don't want to pay that money to him when I can get value for him right now rather than wait ... It doesn't matter to me what you do in free agency because I do not want to pay , period." [...] O'Neal agreed with Bryant: [...] "There's {{no doubt in my mind}} Kobe is telling the truth.
