40|$|The {{formation}} of stable back beads {{in the first}} layer weld during one side multilayer welding is important to achieve high quality welded metal joints. The authors thus employed the switch back welding method for welding V groove joints, with 4 mm root gap, without using backing plates. In this method, the power source, <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> <b>motor,</b> and robot manipulators are the computer based cooperative control. In this robotic welding system, there are 4 personal computers. In order to achieve the good quality of the welding, {{it is important to}} trace the welding line. The personal computer for controlling of the robot is synchronized with other computers, i. e., the computer controls other units. The suitability of the welding conditions for each root gap was verified by observation of the arc, molten pool and external appearance of back beads...|$|E

Three experiments were conducted where the current was {{in the form of}} a very slow sawtooth waveform from 200 A to 380 A over a period of 50 seconds. Two low frequency pulsed current welds were made using a 650 A peak current and a Hz. All welds were made bead on mild steel plate using {{constant current}} GMAW equipment and argon + 2 % oxygen shielding gas. After welding, the plates were cut, ground, polished and etched with 12 % nital solution to show depth of penetration. The constant current welds showed that unlike its behavior in GTAW, penetration increases gradually over the current range tested. Also, the growth of the finger constituted nearly all of the total penetration increase indicating convective flows of increasing magnitude. The ramped current experiments reinforced the observation that penetration increases gradually over the current range examined. The weld pool was also observed to fluctuate, slightly depress and finally depress significantly as the compound vortex started to form, formed completely and then grew stronger. The low frequency pulsed gas metal arc welds realized very little penetration because the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> <b>motor</b> was not fast enough and the torch had to be raised causing severe arc spreading.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims at {{optimizing}} the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed {{against the}} welding speed during the pulse-MIG (Metal Inert Gas) lap joint fillet weld of 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy typically {{used for the}} light-weight car body. Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments were conducted with various <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min, and the bead characteristics were evaluated. As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed should increase as well. On the other hand, {{it is clear that}} the maximum value of the objective function has decreased. Originality/value: This research revealed the relationship between the welding speed and the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed considering the welding productivity and quality. In addition, the criterion to evaluate the degree of weldability during lap welding is suggested according to the quality and objective functions...|$|R

The increase of scanning velocity decreases the depth and width of molten bath, and abates laser hole-effect, so the metal plate can not be welded penetration.

This paper investigates the forming ability of vertical <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> with an axisymmetric multi-laser source, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated components.

Most of the grains in the samples are equiaxed grains, and a small amount of short columnar grains exist which are parallel to each other. The microstructure of the fabricated samples exhibits a fine basket-weave structure and martensite due to the fast cooling rate which was caused by the small size of the molten pool and the additional heat dissipation from the <b>feeding</b> <b>wire.</b> The static tensile test shows that the average ultimate tensile strength is 1140 MPa in the scanning direction and 1115 MPa in the building direction, and the average elongation is about 6 % in both directions...|$|R

The results showed that the arc current increases along with arc voltage increase. The lower the spraying voltage is, the smaller the molten grain size becomes.

40|$|As laser brazing {{benefits}} from advantages such as smooth joints and small heat-affected zones, {{it has become}} established as a joining technology that is widely used in the automotive industry. With the processing of complex-shaped geometries, recent developed brazing heads suffer, however, from the need for continuous reorientation of the optical system and/or limited accessibility due to lateral <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> This motivates {{the development of a}} laser brazing head with coaxial <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and enhanced functionality. An optical system is designed that allows to generate an annular intensity distribution in the working zone. The utilization of complex optical components avoids obscuration of the optical path by the <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> The new design overcomes the disadvantages of the state-of-the-art brazing heads with lateral <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and {{benefits from}} the independence of direction while processing complex geometries.

40|$|The wetting {{behavior}} and interfacial microstructures of molten magnesium AZ 61 alloy {{on the surface}} of two different Q 235 and galvanized steel plates under the condition of cold metal transfer were investigated by using dynamic sessile drop method.

Al-Fe intermetallic layer was observed whether the substrate is Q 235 steel or galvanized steel, and the formation of Al-Fe intermetallic layer should satisfy the thermodynamic condition of such Mg-Al/Fe system. The wettability of molten AZ 61 magnesium alloy is improved with the increase of <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed whether on Q 235 steel surface or on galvanized steel surface, good wettability on Q 235 steel surface is due to severe interface reaction when <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed increases, good wettability on galvanized steel surface is attributed to the aggravating zinc volatilization. When the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed is ≤ 10. 5 m&# 183;min - 1, the wettability of Mg alloy on Q 235 steel plate is better than on galvanized steel plate.

From the results obtained the grain size of weld zone and HAZ increases when the welding voltage and <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate increases. The strength of the welded joint was directly proportional to the increasing in voltage and <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate but their hardness value was irreversibly proportional towards the increasing parameter value.
