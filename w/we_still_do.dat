[...] This is mainly due to access to forest areas becoming restricted and money not filtering down to local people. [...] “Keeping in mind that the Law only provides for conservation of 15% of the DRC’s forests and that more than 40% are earmarked for commercial logging, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not know what percentage of Congolese forests are to be returned back to the indigenous communities to enable them to practice their cultural and socio-economic activities” (Byayuwa).|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were looking}} for a {{replacement}} for their drummer D.H. Peligro, who had recently been fired. Already into the process of working on their fourth studio album and hiring new guitarist, John Frusciante, the band held open auditions for a new drummer. Smith {{was one of the last}} drummers to audition for the band and the band felt that on looks alone, Smith would be the wrong fit as he looked more hair-metal than punk. Nonetheless, the band was blown away by his audition. Singer Anthony Kiedis admired Smith and found his persistence impressive. Smith joined the Chili Peppers in December 1988 and within a few months was recording his first album with the band, Mother's Milk. Smith reflected on joining the band in a 2012 interview by saying “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, cool, they have a record deal. Great! I’d love to be in a band that has a record deal. We started playing, and right away we just hit it off musically. I was like, ‘Man, this is a blast! These guys are great!’ ... We were just doing what we do. We just jammed, which is what <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> today. It’s very similar.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} years of the state of Israel the village was {{subjected}} to repeated searches by the army and anyone who had not registered as resident in November 1948 could be expelled. One case attracted a lot of public criticism. In June 1950, the IDF and police rounded up 105 men and women believed to be infiltrators were deported to Jordan. In an open letter to the Knesset, the inhabitants of Abu Ghosh claimed that the army had [...] "surrounded our village, and taken our women, children and old folk, and thrown them over the border and into the Negev Desert, and many of them died in consequence, when they were shot [...] the borders." [...] The letter further stated that they woke up to [...] "shouts blaring over the loudspeaker announcing that the village was surrounded and anyone trying to get out would be shot....The police and military forces then began to enter the houses and conduct meticulous searches, but no contraband was found. In the end, using force and blows, they gathered up our women, and old folk and children, the sick and the blind and pregnant women. These shouted for help but there was no saviour. And we looked on and were powerless to do anything save beg for mercy. Alas, our pleas were of no avail... They then took the prisoners, who were weeping and screaming, to an unknown place, and <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not know what befell them." ...|$|E

However, this I know, {{that he is a}} very pestilent fellow, from some discourse the other day that I had with him in this town; for then, talking with him, I heard him say that our religion was naught, and such by which a man could by no means please God. Which saying of his, my lord, your lordship very well knows what necessarily thence will follow; to wit, that <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> worship in vain, are yet in our sins, and finally shall be destroyed: and this is that which I have to say.|$|E

It is apparent that Saint-Mars himself either was unacquainted with this secret, or was supposed by Louvois and the King to be unaware of it. He had been ordered never to allow Dauger to tell him: he {{was not allowed to}} see the letters on the subject between Louvois and Fouquet. <b>We</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not know, and never shall know, whether Dauger himself knew his own secret, or whether (as he had anticipated) he was locked up for not divulging what he did not know.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, {{even when}} the poor decide that the method of {{purchasing}} salvation by offering rams and goats or bringing gold to the altar must be wrong because they cannot afford it, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not feel [...] "saved" [...] without a sacrifice and a victim. In vain do we try to substitute mystical rites that cost nothing, such as circumcision, or, {{as a substitute for}} that, baptism. Our sense of justice still demands an expiation, a sacrifice, a sufferer for our sins. And this leaves the poor man still in his old difficulty; for if it was impossible for him to procure rams and goats and shekels, how much more impossible is it for him to find a neighbor who will voluntarily suffer for his sins: one who will say cheerfully [...] "You have committed a murder. Well, never mind: I am willing to be hanged for it in your stead?" ...|$|E

6000|$|But <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} how the horse and mare came in, or why the statue of Demeter had a horse's head. 'This seems simply {{to be due to}} the fact that, quite apart from this myth, the sun had, in India at least, often been {{conceived}} as a horse [...] . and the dawn had been likened to a mare.' But how does this explain the problem? The Vedic poets cited (ii. 542) either referred to the myth which we have to explain, or they used a poetical expression, knowing perfectly well what they meant. As long as they knew what they meant, they could not make an unseemly fable out of a poetical phrase. Not till after the meaning was forgotten could the myth arise. But the myth existed already in the Veda! And the unseemliness is precisely what we have to account for; that is our enigma.|$|E
60|$|The {{expression}} here considered, {{whether that}} of a playful sneer or ferocious snarl, {{is one of the}} most curious which occurs in man. It reveals his animal descent; for no one, even if rolling on the ground in a deadly grapple with an enemy, and attempting to bite him, would try to use his canine teeth more than his other teeth. We may readily believe from our affinity to the anthropomorphous apes that our male semi-human progenitors possessed great canine teeth, and men are now occasionally born having them of unusually large size, with interspaces in the opposite jaw for their reception.[17] We may further suspect, notwithstanding that we have no support from analogy, that our semi-human progenitors uncovered their canine teeth when prepared for battle, as <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> when feeling ferocious, or when merely sneering at or defying some one, without any intention of making a real attack with our teeth.|$|E
60|$|Take, for example, {{the immense}} cluster of {{difficulties}} that arises {{out of the}} increasing complexity of our state. On every hand we are creating officials, and compared {{with only a few}} years ago the private life in a dozen fresh directions comes into contact with officialdom. But <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> practically nothing to work out the interesting changes that occur in this sort of man and that, when you withdraw him as it were from the common crowd of humanity, put his mind if not his body into uniform and endow him with powers and functions and rules. It is manifestly a study of the profoundest public and personal importance. It is manifestly a study of increasing importance. The process of social and political organisation that has been going on for the last quarter of a century is pretty clearly going on now if anything with increasing vigour--and for the most part the entire dependence of the consequences of the whole problem upon the reaction between the office on the one hand and the weak, uncertain, various human beings who take office on the other, doesn't seem even to be suspected by the energetic, virtuous and more or less amiable people whose activities in politics and upon the backstairs of politics bring about these developments. They assume that the sort of official they need, a combination of god-like virtue and intelligence with unfailing mechanical obedience, can be made out of just any young nephew. And I know of no means of persuading people that this is a rather unjustifiable assumption, and of creating an intelligent controlling criticism of officials and of assisting conscientious officials to an effective self-examination, and generally of keeping the atmosphere of official life sweet and healthy, except the novel. Yet so far the novel has scarcely begun its attack upon this particular field of human life, and all the attractive varied play of motive it contains.|$|E
