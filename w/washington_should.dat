It was also the subject of a New York Times editorial and investigated on CBS News by Walter Cronkite. Washington was fined $10,000, and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. The Rockets were furious.

Initially, Khartoum sought U.S. sanctions relief, particularly for its growing oil sector, in return for access to its intelligence data on Al Qaeda's nascent network and bin Laden's activities there. However, the sanctions continued until U.S. officials exempted some in unrelated policy decisions that benefited U.S. oil companies.

With the ultimate goal of advocating the best protection for the consumer, the discussion will suggest that <b>Washington</b> courts <b>should</b> not create an exception. A review of other exceptions to the learned intermediary rule does not support abandoning the doctrine when a drug company advertises its product directly to consumers. Nevertheless, advertising does affect consumer purchases and does influence consumer choices, and drug companies should accept the responsibility to present balanced information.

2500|$|Analyst Jessica Tuchman Mathews of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace {{agreed that}} {{imposing}} democracy [...] "from scratch" [...] was unwise, and didn't work. Realist critics such as George F. Kennan argued U.S. responsibility {{is only to}} protect its own citizens and that <b>Washington</b> <b>should</b> deal with other governments on that basis alone; they criticize president Woodrow Wilson's emphasis on democratization and nation-building although it wasn't mentioned in Wilson's Fourteen Points, {{and the failure of}} the League of Nations to enforce international will regarding Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan in the 1930s. Realist critics attacked the idealism of Wilson as being ill-suited for weak states created at the Paris Peace Conference. Others, however, criticize the U.S. Senate's decision not to join the League of Nations which was based on isolationist public sentiment as being one cause for the organization's ineffectiveness.|$|E

The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of Benjamin Franklin. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Thomas Paine and probably Col.

[...] According to one commentator, [...] "ea party conservatives see the GOP loss as a victory for conservativism over mere political party loyalty.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the GWMNMA's annual meeting in February 1924, {{construction}} on the first floor was almost complete. The first five terraces above the street (the [...] "lower terrace") were built using Potomac bluestone for the walls, while the walks were graveled. The topmost sixth terrace (the [...] "upper terrace", which encircled the building and its main entrance) was constructed with Conway Pink Granite for a base. The base was [...] high and [...] thick. [...] The upper portion of this wall was concrete. More than [...] of concrete and [...] of steel reinforcing bars were used {{in this part of the}} wall. The GWMNMA believed that the second floor would be finished by the end of the construction season in the fall of 1924, and that the entire structure would be done by late 1927 or early 1928. The association also decided that a statue of <b>Washington</b> <b>should</b> be placed in the memorial atrium, and that this statue should be a marble copy of Jean-Antoine Houdon's 1788 statue of George Washington (which stood in the rotunda of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond).

40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the 2 Ì† 2 could have 2 Ì† 2 {{standard}} makes {{a mockery of the}} probable cause protections provided by the Fourth Amendment and that the <b>Washington</b> courts <b>should</b> not adopt that standard. Instead, because Washington courts have traditionally held that Article 1, Section 7, of the Washington Constitution provides broader protection than the Fourth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, the <b>Washington</b> courts <b>should</b> continue to use the 2 Ì† 2 would have 2 Ì† 2 standard to determine whether a stop is pretextual under Article 1, Section 7. 11. Part II of this Note briefly describes the applicable search and seizure doctrine and tracks the split in the federal circuits regarding which standard is appropriate for the courts to apply in determining whether a pretext stop has occurred. Specifically, this section will compare the strengths and flaws of three standards: (1) the subjective, (2) the 2 Ì† 2 could have, 2 Ì† 2 and (3) the 2 Ì† 2 would have. 2 Ì† 2 Part III of this Note introduces the Whren case and analyzes the unanimous opinion, authored by Justice Scalia. This section contrasts Justice Scalia 2 Ì† 7 s reasoning and conclusions with those of Washington State courts and various commentators. Part IV shifts focus and undertakes an independent state constitutional analysis by applying the six nonexclusive Gunwall factors. Application of the Gunwall factors indicates whether the Washington State Constitution provides broader protection than does the Fourth Amendment. Next, this section analyzes the facts of Whren under Washington State law to determine whether Washington courts would have decided Whren differently under Article 1, Section 7, of the State Constitution. This Note concludes that, while the Whren decision textually meets the Fourth Amendment requirements, it tramples on the spirit of the U. S. Constitution in two ways. First, the Whren decision makes a mockery of the probable cause protections of the Fourth Amendment. Second, it effectively discards any meaningful pretext stop doctrine, thus giving police officers nearly unbridled discretion to conduct pretext stops. As such, <b>Washington</b> courts <b>should</b> enforce a pretext doctrine with bite by continuing to apply the 2 Ì† 2 would have 2 Ì† 2 standard...|$|R
