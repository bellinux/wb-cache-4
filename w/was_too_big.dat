It relied on provisions transported from Russia, either directly through Polish territory or theoretically neutral Prussia.

To avoid starving his army, Paskevich ordered two permanent bridges built across the Vistula, in Góra and Podgórze.

Cook and Bell put on 50 runs together before Cook was bowled by Kyle Mills for 34 {{at the end}} of the eighth over, and Bell followed soon after for 25, caught by James Franklin off Bracewell. Root and Morgan both went for scores in the 20s, but the tail was found wanting as only Woakes (13) and Anderson (28) from the last six batsmen managed to reach double-figures. Trott made a valiant attempt to make up for his dropped catch off Guptill earlier in the day with an unbeaten 109 off 104 balls, but with wickets falling all around him, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> a task for him to manage by himself. England were eventually bowled out for 273 with just under six overs left, giving New Zealand an 86-run victory and an unassailable lead in the series.|$|E

25|$|The German war plan (the Schlieffen Plan) of 1905 was {{modified}} in 1908 to invade Belgium {{on the way}} to Paris but not the Netherlands. It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on. There were other factors that made it expedient for both the Allies and the Central Powers for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the Scheldt, the Rhine and the Meuse Rivers. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the Ruhr and connected it with the Dutch port of Rotterdam. Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> a risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to bring about a}} purer form of Islam among the Sanhaja Berbers, Abdallah ibn Yasin founded the Almoravid {{movement}} in present-day Mauritania and Western Sahara. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the Soninke, practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the Lamtuna Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the Zenata Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and Yusuf ibn Tashfin, because it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the Ghana Empire in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.|$|E

With the 103rd Bataillon Parachutiste (103rd Parachute Battalion) added to the irregulars, the combined force moved down from their hill position to Phonsavan on 29 April. In {{the ruins of the}} town smashed by artillery and air strikes, they found two BTR-40 Armored Cars, 18 other vehicles, 12 37mm antiaircraft guns, and a 75mm howitzer, which they destroyed. Continuing through town two kilometers to the northwest, {{on the north side of}} Route 4 they uncovered a cave complex crammed with pre-positioned communist supplies. Behind barrels of rocks barricading cave entrances against air attack, they found 300 tons of medical supplies. Another cave contained hospital beds for 1,000 patients. Still another contained over a mile of supplies within it; as the cache <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to ruin, local Buddhist monks were convinced to lay a curse upon it so the superstitious Pathet Lao would not reclaim the goods. There were operating theaters; one had a pair of X-ray machines. Air America flew in a cargo of varied explosives to destroy the goods. The 1,000 Hmong troops occupied Phonsavan for the first time since 1962; they did not have to fire a shot.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESISHamlet <b>is</b> <b>Too</b> BigbyBrian SmolinMaster of Fine Arts in Theatre and Dance (Acting) University of California, San Diego, 2015 Professor Gregory D. Wallace, ChairWhile playing Hamlet, I {{often felt}} overwhelmed, {{stressed}} out, and afraid. I {{struggled with the}} daunting and difficult nature of the role, but within that struggle, I found {{a deeper understanding of}} many of the concepts central to my training at UCSD. I had to trust and rely on that training, because Hamlet <b>is</b> just <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to do otherwise. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to control. It's <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to <b>be</b> neat or safe. I had to let it to be a mess and allow myself to be wrong. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to play emotion. How could I ever be sad enough? I had to play actions instead. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to do all at once, and too vast to let the story go untold. I had to live one moment at a time and strive for clarity of thought and language. Hamlet <b>is</b> far <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to do alone. I had to listen to my cast mates, and allow them to affect, change, and lift me. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> damn long, and too damn hard, not to have any fun, and I found joy and humor in places that I never expected. And lastly, Hamlet <b>is</b> far <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to ever <b>be</b> finished, and every performance was an opportunity to grow, and discover anew. Playing Hamlet forced me to be active, strive for clarity, discover, have fun, and much more. I'm a better actor now than when I started. Hamlet <b>is</b> just <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for anything less...|$|R
25|$|The {{restoration}} of Suur Tõll {{has been an}} enormous task which has included cleaning garbage accumulated in the ship {{over the years and}} finding the missing fittings, including the helm that had been swapped to a steering wheel of a truck during the night before the departure and the large bronze bell of the icebreaker which was found in a military museum in Leningrad. However, not everything had been stolen — for example, the old German piano was still in the saloon because it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to be transported away. While the original piano was destroyed in the First World War, the current musical instrument is from the same manufacturer and dates back to the early 20th century. Despite the limited funding and materials, Suur Tõll was largely restored during the 1990s. In 1997, it was found out that the rivets under the waterline were leaking water and the icebreaker was drydocked at Balti Laevaremonditehas {{for the first time since}} 1986. However, over the years the hull of the old icebreaker had deteriorated even further, flooding the tanks with a mixture of water and black oil. In 2011, the Estonian Maritime Administration requested the Estonian Maritime Museum to draw up a restoration plan to save the vessel. In September 2013, Suur Tõll was closed for renovations which included extensive repairs to the hull in a dry dock. While the icebreaker retained her 1950s post-refit outfit, the saloon was restored to its original 1910s art nouveau style. She was re-opened to visitors in 2014.|$|E
