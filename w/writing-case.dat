60|$|A moment passed--and I saw {{the ghostly}} Presence stoop over the living woman. It lifted the <b>writing-case</b> from her lap. It rested the <b>writing-case</b> on her shoulder. Its white fingers took {{the pen and}} wrote on the {{unfinished}} letter. It put the <b>writing-case</b> back on the lap of the living woman. Still standing behind the chair, it turned toward me. It looked at me once more. And now it beckoned--beckoned to me to approach.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{mean to say}} you {{are really}} in earnest!" [...] said Midwinter, as the other opened his <b>writing-case</b> and dipped his pen in the ink.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{lifted the}} <b>writing-case,</b> {{on which the}} letter and the pen lay, off the lady's lap; and, while you wrote, you rested the case on her shoulder." ...|$|E
6000|$|Father's {{first day}} of work in the leather-goods {{department}} was the most difficult he had ever known. His knowledge of shoes and leather had become purely mechanical; a few glances at new stock and at trade journals had kept him aware of changing styles. Now he had suddenly to become omniscient in regard to hand-bags, portfolios, <b>writing-cases,</b> music-rolls; learn leathers which he had never handled--cobra-seal, walrus, écrasé, monkey-skin. He had to appear placidly official, almost pontifical, when vague ladies appeared, poked clippings from holiday magazines at him, and demanded, [...] "I want something like that." [...] "That" [...] usually depicted articles of whose use he had the most indefinite notions. Other ladies, ponderous ladies, who wanted vast quantities of free advice before purchasing Christmas presents, desired encyclopedic information about sewing-cases, picnic-sets, traveling pillow-cases, telephone-pads, guest-books, and [...] "a cover for my Social Register, and I want you to be sure it's the very latest thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{are very}} fond of {{anything}} {{in the way of}} notebooks, 8vo and 12mo sizes (good paper), <b>writing-cases</b> (which must be good if given at all), patent safety inkstands--these things are useful on board ship, and can be carried to the islands and brought back again safely. Work-baskets or boxes for the girls, with good serviceable needles, pins, thread, scissors, thimbles, tapes, &c. &c., not a plaything. Here we can buy for them, or keep in the store for them to buy, many things that are much too bulky to send from a distance, the freight would be ruinous. The [...] "Southern Cross" [...] brings them usually to us. Such things I mean as good carpet-bags, from 5s. to 10s., stout tin boxes with locks and keys, axes, tools, straw hats, saucepans, good strong stuff (tweed or moleskin) for trousers and shirts, which they cut out and make up for themselves, quite understanding the inferior character of [...] "slop" [...] work, good flannel for under-shirts, or for making up into Crimean shirts, Nottingham drill, good towelling, huckaback, &c., ought to be worth while to send out, and if bought in large quantities at the manufacturer's, it would pay us to get it in England, especially if the said manufacturer reduced the price a little in consequence of the use to be made of his goods.|$|R
60|$|The <b>writing-case</b> was searched, {{and some}} letter paper {{was found in}} it of the size required. Mrs. Lecount resumed her dictation; and Noel Vanstone resumed his pen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you {{not read}} me better, Mary?" [...] said Fan; {{but her face}} was still bent over her <b>writing-case,</b> nor would she say more, {{although}} the other stood by waiting.|$|E
60|$|Fan, without replying, {{sat down}} before her <b>writing-case.</b> The other {{paused at the}} door, and after hesitating a few moments came back and {{put her hands on}} the girl's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Her aunt kindly {{established}} her at {{a little}} table, with a leathern <b>writing-case,</b> and her uncle mended a pen for her. Then her aunt went away, and he sat down to his own letters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Uncle Geoffrey: and Henrietta, {{putting down}} the <b>writing-case,</b> retreated with downcast eyes, with a moment's {{perception}} of the higher tone of mind {{to which he had}} tried to raise her.|$|E
60|$|Alone in her room, Emily {{opened her}} <b>writing-case.</b> Searching among {{the letters in}} it, she drew out a printed paper. It was the Handbill {{describing}} {{the man who had}} escaped from the inn, and offering a reward for the discovery of him.|$|E
60|$|She {{took from}} the <b>writing-case</b> the long letter {{which she had}} written to Norah, and slowly read it through. The letter quieted her. When she reached the blank space left at the end, she hurriedly turned back and began it over again.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{pleasant}} {{to think of}} poor Alda's delight," [...] said Geraldine, over her <b>writing-case.</b> [...] "After all her troubles, to have her utmost ambition fulfilled at last; and yet-—and yet it does seem turning that pretty creature over {{to a life of}} temptation." ...|$|E
60|$|Some minutes {{had passed}} when Hetty rose and took down her <b>writing-case</b> from a shelf. She {{could at least}} {{communicate}} with Larry, for the maid, who {{had more than one}} admirer among the cow-boys, had found a means by which letters could be conveyed; but the girl could not command her thoughts, and written sympathy seemed so poor and cold a thing. Two letters were written and flung into the stove, for Flora Schuyler's counsel was bearing fruit; and she had commenced two more when there was a tapping at the door. Hetty looked up with a little flash in her eyes, and swept the papers into the <b>writing-case</b> as Clavering came in. Then she rose, and stood looking at him very coldly.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} <b>writing-case</b> in which I keep the papers {{sent to me}} by the Rector of Belhaven, and placed them on the table by which she was sitting. The more plainly and briefly I spoke now, the better I thought it might be for both of us.|$|E
6000|$|She {{ran up to}} her {{own room}} with a lurking {{distrust}} in her changed self which warned her to act, and not to think. Without waiting to remove her shawl or to take off her hat, she opened her <b>writing-case</b> and addressed these lines to Captain Wragge as fast as her pen could trace them: ...|$|E
6000|$|The Boy {{was dead}} on the charpoy in {{the centre of the}} bare, lime-washed room. He had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver. The gun-cases were still strapped, so was the bedding, and on the table lay The Boy's <b>writing-case</b> with photographs. He had gone away to die like a {{poisoned}} rat! ...|$|E
60|$|A {{travelling}} <b>writing-case</b> stood open on a {{table near}} them. In an interval of silence the girl looked at it reluctantly. They had been talking of family affairs--and had spoken in Italian, so as to keep their domestic secrets from the ears of the strangers about them. The old woman {{was the first to}} resume the conversation.|$|E
60|$|Away she ran {{to fetch}} her bonnet and shawl, while Henrietta walked up after her, saying she would just fetch her mamma's <b>writing-case</b> down for her, and then get ready directly. On coming down, she could not help waiting a moment before {{advancing}} to the table, to hear what was passing between her mother and uncle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{relieved}} my mind of this confession, I may {{now come}} to the proper object of my letter. I promised, if you could not find leisure time to visit us to-day, to write and tell you all that happened after you left us. The day has passed without our seeing you. So I open my <b>writing-case</b> and perform my promise.|$|E
60|$|The priest now {{rose from}} the stool, and from the <b>writing-case</b> that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper, and a flint and steel. With these he sealed up the chest and the {{cupboard}} with Sir Daniel's arms, Hatch looking on disconsolate; and then the whole party proceeded, somewhat timorously, to sally {{from the house and}} get to horse.|$|E
60|$|Hearing this, Arthur volunteered {{the loan}} of a {{traveling}} <b>writing-case,</b> {{which he said}} he had with him, and, bringing it to the bed, shook the note-paper out of the pocket of the case forthwith in his usual careless way. With the paper there fell out on the counterpane of the bed a small packet of sticking-plaster, and a little water-color drawing of a landscape.|$|E
6000|$|In the meanwhile, {{the girl}} {{contrived}} {{an excuse for}} entering the room where she was quite aware Hetty and Clavering had met. She did not find her mistress, but, as it happened, noticed the <b>writing-case,</b> and, having a stake in affairs, opened it. Inside she found two sheets of paper, and after considering the probabilities of detection appropriated one of them on which was written, [...] "Larry dear." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Slope, {{as was his}} custom, {{asked for}} Mr. Stanhope, and was told, as was the servant's custom, that the signora was in the drawing-room. Upstairs he {{accordingly}} went. He found her, as he always did, lying on her sofa with a French volume before her and a beautiful little inlaid <b>writing-case</b> open on her table. At the moment of his entrance {{she was in the}} act of writing.|$|E
6000|$|In that <b>Writing-case</b> his Majesty {{found what}} we know; nothing but mysterious effects of female art, and no light whatever. It {{is a great}} source of wrath and of sorrow to him, that neither in the <b>Writing-case,</b> nor in Katte's or the Prince's {{so-called}} [...] "Confessions," [...] can the thing be seen into. A deeper bottom it must have, thinks his Majesty, but knows not what or where. To overturn the Country, belike; and fling the Kaiser, and European Balance of Power, bottom uppermost? Me they presumably meant to poison! he tells Seckendorf one day. [Dickens's Despatch, 16th September, 1730.] Was ever Father more careful for his children, soul and body? Anxious, to excess, to bring them up in orthodox nurture and admonition: and this is how they reward me, Herr Feldzeugmeister! [...] "Had he honestly confessed, and told me the whole truth, at Wesel, I would have made it up with him quietly there. But now it must go its lengths; and the whole world shall be judge between us." [...] [Seckendorf (Forster, ubi supra), 23d September.] ...|$|E
60|$|The next afternoon, Johnnie, having as a {{preliminary}} inscribed his brother's unwieldy name {{all over the}} fly-leaf, was proceeding most happily {{to read the book}} aloud, lying on the hearth-rug, with his heels in the air. He read his mamma into a slumber, his papa into a deep reverie, which resulted in his dragging himself up from his chair, by the help of the chimney-piece, and reaching pen and <b>writing-case</b> from Violet's table.|$|E
60|$|The fire in my {{room had}} burned low in my absence. One of the closed {{curtains}} had been drawn back a few inches, so as to admit through the window a ray of the dying light. On the boundary limit where the light was crossed by the obscurity which filled {{the rest of the}} room, I saw Miss Dunross seated, with her veil drawn and her <b>writing-case</b> on her knee, waiting my return.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps Miss Wells thought chiefly of the {{brightening}} in her child's manner, and {{the alert}} vivacity of eye and voice such {{as she had}} not seen in her since she had lost her mother; but be that as it might, her words were the very sanction so much longed for, and ere long Honora had her <b>writing-case</b> before her, cogitating over the opening address, as if her whole meaning were implied in them.|$|E
60|$|Then {{again the}} old couple thanked Mary {{for what she}} had done; and one day, in secret, went off to Tunbridge Wells to buy a little present as a proof of their gratitude. Colonel Parsons {{suggested}} a bracelet, but his wife was sure that Mary would prefer something useful; so they brought back with them a very elaborate and expensive <b>writing-case,</b> which with a few shy words they presented to her. Mary, poor thing, was overcome with pleasure.|$|E
60|$|This {{was such}} a fine {{sentence}} {{that it was almost}} a comfort, and she thought of writing it to Maude Sefton, but as she got up to fetch her <b>writing-case</b> from the schoolroom, she saw that her books were standing just in the way she did not like, and with all the volumes mixed up together. So she tumbled them all out of the shelves on the floor, and at that moment Mrs. Halfpenny looked into the room.|$|E
60|$|Clavering {{bent his}} head, and took himself {{away with the}} best grace he could, while Hetty, who, perhaps {{because she had been}} under a heavy strain, became {{suddenly}} sensible of a most illogical desire to laugh, afterwards admitted that he really accomplished it becomingly. But the laughter {{that would have been a}} relief to her did not come, and after toying in a purposeless fashion with her <b>writing-case,</b> she rose and slipped out of the room, unfortunately leaving it open.|$|E
6000|$|He {{suddenly}} {{tossed the}} letter {{away from him}} on the table, and snatched a sheet of note-paper out of the <b>writing-case.</b> [...] "Here goes for Mrs. Glenarm!" [...] he said to himself; and wrote back to his brother, in one line: [...] "Dear Julius, Expect me to-morrow. G. D." [...] The impassible man-servant stood by while he wrote, looking at his magnificent breadth of chest, and thinking what a glorious [...] "staying-power" [...] {{was there for the}} last terrible mile of the coming race.|$|E
60|$|The dinner {{went off}} well--there were few {{enough for the}} {{conversation}} to be general. The young men began to strike out sparks of wit against each other--Flora put in a word or two--Ethel grew so much interested in the discussion, that her face lighted up, and she joined in it, {{as if it had}} been only between her father and brother--keen, clear, and droll. After that, she had her full share in the conversation, and enjoyed it so much that, when she left the dinner-table, she fetched her <b>writing-case</b> to sketch the colloquy for Margaret and her father.|$|E
60|$|She spoke very quietly. The faint, sad {{voice was}} fainter and sadder than ever. She kept her head bent over her <b>writing-case,</b> instead of turning it toward me as usual {{while we were}} talking. I still felt the mysterious {{trembling}} which had oppressed me in the garden. Drawing a chair near the fire, I stirred the embers together, and tried to warm myself. Our positions in the room left some little distance between us. I could only see her sidewise, as she sat by {{the window in the}} sheltering darkness of the curtain which still remained drawn.|$|E
6000|$|And she {{directly}} fetched her <b>writing-case,</b> smiling queerly {{to herself}} as she bent over the table where it stood. She produced a sheet of paper, a new pen, drew an arm-chair to the table, and presenting her hand to old Helstone, begged permission to install him in it. For a minute he was a little stiff, and stood wrinkling his copper-coloured forehead strangely. At last he muttered, [...] "Well, you are neither my wife nor my daughter, so I'll be led for once; but mind--I know I am led. Your little female manœuvres don't blind me." ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{the vague}} distrust, the inexpressible dread possessed him, and {{kept him in}} his chair. He had put his carpet-bag on the table when he first entered the room, and he now took the key from his pocket, reached out his hand softly, opened the bag, and groped in it for his {{traveling}} <b>writing-case,</b> in which he {{knew that there was}} a small store of matches. When he had got one of the matches he waited before he struck it on the coarse wooden table, and listened intently again without knowing why. Still there was no sound in the room but the steady, ceaseless rattling sound of the rain.|$|E
