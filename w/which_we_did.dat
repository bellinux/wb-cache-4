[...] He was up for a part in [...] at the time, but considered the role as Joe [...] "a happy accident". [...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I am convinced that I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. [...] There's a tape out there, somewhere, with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists". [...] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to [...] "think of [...] as children's TV", but rather as [...] "acting and telling the truth".|$|E

Theater Crafts Industry {{went so far}} as to say, [...] "In Quigley Down Under, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in 1990, the Sharps rifle practically co-stars with Tom Selleck." [...] This statement was echoed by gunwriters including John Taffin in Guns and Lionel Atwill in Field & Stream, crediting the film with an impact to rival that of Dirty Harry on the Smith & Wesson [...]44 Magnum. [...] The rifle in Quigley has a 34" [...] barrel, as opposed to the standard 30". Firearms manufacturers such as Davide Pedersoli and Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company have credited these movies with an increase in demand for those rifles. As a result of the popularity of the film, a Sharps match is held annually in Forsyth, Montana known as the [...] "Matthew Quigley Buffalo Rifle Match". Originally a 44-inch target was placed at 1,000 yards for each shooter, remniscent of a scene from the movie. The match is billed as the [...] "biggest rifle event shooting in Eastern Montana since the Custer Massacre" [...] and has since developed into a two-day competition with eight shots for score on six steel silhouette targets at ranges from 350 to 805 yards.|$|E
