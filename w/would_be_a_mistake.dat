5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{terrorist}} attack in Burgas, Bulgaria, was denounced by governments and supranational organizations worldwide. Bulgaria's EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva expressed her shock and sadness; Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and conveyed his condolences over the attack; Foreign Minister Nikolay Mladenov condemned the attack {{but said that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to prematurely jump to conclusions.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> {{to expect}} to find the modern fully {{developed}} doctrine of papal primacy in the first centuries, thereby failing to recognize the Church's historical reality. The figure of the pope {{as leader of the}} worldwide church developed over time, as the figure of the bishop as leader of the local church seems to have appeared later than in the time of the apostles.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{agreement}} among theologians that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to conceive of the essence of God existing by itself and independently of the attributes or of the attributes being an additional characteristic of the Divine Being. They are essential qualities which exist permanently in his very Being and are co-existent with it. Any alteration in them would imply an alteration in the essential being of God.|$|E
25|$|While privately {{convinced}} that launching a strike {{under these conditions}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> and aware that the AFL leadership felt even more strongly on this subject, Foster nonetheless continued to organize as if a strike was in the offing. The rank and file workers voted overwhelmingly in November, 1917 and more moderate leaders, such as Fitzpatrick {{and the leader of}} Local 87, used this strike threat to great advantage in negotiating with {{the federal government and the}} employers.|$|E

25|$|Although privately Somerville {{felt that}} such an attack <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> he carried out his orders. The French refused to comply with British conditions, so on 3 July 1940, Force H {{attacked}} French ships at Mers-el-Kébir. Somerville's forces inflicted severe damage on their erstwhile allies, most notably sinking the battleship Bretagne with heavy loss of life. Several other major French ships were damaged during the bombardment. The operation was judged a success, although he admitted privately to his wife {{that he had not}} been quite as aggressive in the destruction as he could have been.|$|E
25|$|Tirthankara {{revive the}} {{fourfold}} order of Shraman, Shramani, Śrāvaka, and Śrāvika called sangha. As per Jain literature, exactly 24 Tirthankara grace each {{half of the}} cosmic time cycle. Tirthankara can be called teaching gods who teach the Jain philosophy. However it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to regard the tirthankara as gods analogous to the gods of the Hindu pantheon despite the superficial resemblances between Jain and Hindu ways of worship. Tirthankara, being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions {{with the rest of}} the universe. They are not the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.|$|E
25|$|After {{the match}} {{there were reports}} in the media that Australia had batted {{conservatively}} in their final 8 overs after the final re-start, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands' par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, {{in the same way}} that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), so the only undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands' par score was Australia's final score, so they should have tried to maximise this.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{societies}} of hunter-gatherer tribes had no social stratification, and later {{societies of}} the Bronze Age had noticeable social stratification, which saw {{the creation of}} occupational specialization, the state and social classes of individuals who were of the elite ruling or religious classes, full-time warriors and wealthy merchants, contrasted with those individuals {{on the other end}} of the economic spectrum who were poor, enslaved and hungry. In between these two economic models (the hunter-gatherer tribes and Bronze Age civilisations) we find the later Neolithic and Eneolithic societies such as the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, where the first indications of social stratification began to be found. However, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to overemphasise the impact of social stratification in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, since it was still (even in its later phases) very much an egalitarian society. And of course, social stratification was just one of the many aspects of what is regarded as a fully established civilised society, which began to appear in the Bronze Age.|$|E
25|$|Societies {{from the}} earlier Mesolithic period were {{composed}} of hunter gatherer tribes that also had no social stratification.

25|$|It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to {{attribute}} {{the demise of}} Aegina solely {{to the development of}} the Athenian navy. It is probable that the power of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Salamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively to that of Athens. Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which seems to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with Persia. Aegina's medism in 491 is to be explained by its commercial relations with the Persian Empire. It was forced into patriotism in spite of itself, and the glory won by the battle of Salamis was paid for by the loss of its trade and the decay of its marine. The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state is explained by the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which was based on slave-labour. It is impossible, indeed, to accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave-population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been much greater than that of the free inhabitants. In this respect the history of Aegina does but anticipate the history of Greece as a whole.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000, there was some talk of the idea that a best of album <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> by the band, as they were {{generally}} seen as the [...] "end of an artist's creative haul".

500|$|In the 19th century, Vincent van Gogh {{acknowledged}} Ruisdael {{as a major}} influence, {{calling him}} sublime, {{but at the same}} time saying it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to try to copy him. Van Gogh had two Ruisdael prints, The Bush and a Haerlempje, on his wall, and thought the Ruisdaels in the Louvre were [...] "magnificent, especially The Bush, The Breakwater and The Ray of Light". His experience of the French countryside was informed by his memory of Ruisdael's art. Van Gogh's contemporary Claude Monet is also said to be indebted to Ruisdael. Even Piet Mondriaan's minimalism has been traced back to Ruisdael's panoramas.|$|E

500|$|... "t's not {{forcing the}} issue {{to suggest that the}} Holocaust hovers over Barton Fink", writes biographer Ronald Bergan.

Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism. [...] "They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling himself he is doing the right thing, who thinks he understands the 'common man' but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive appeal".

[...] His parents ran a printing house in Glasgow, Crownpoint Publications, and occasionally had spare capacity: they were interested in using the idle time on their machinery to enter the publishing business, and Peter persuaded them to publish paperback science fiction (sf) novels. [...] Two novels were acquired, but when Crownpoint approached a local wholesaler to handle the distribution, they were told that paperbacks <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> and that a magazine, with a regular publication schedule, would be more likely to sell well.
