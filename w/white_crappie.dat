500|$|In April 2010, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission {{performed}} {{a survey of}} the fish species residing in Briar Creek Reservoir. The most common fish observed were yellow perch (645 specimens), brown bullhead (322 specimens), golden shiner (319 specimens), <b>white</b> <b>crappie</b> (216 specimens), hatchery trout (153 specimens), and bluegill (121 specimens). The largest fish observed were common carp, of which two specimens between [...] and [...] were observed. The smallest fish were pumpkinseed, of which 12 specimens between two and four inches (five and ten centimeters) were observed. Minnows also live in West Branch Briar Creek.|$|E
500|$|Fish {{account for}} about 80% of the diet of the common loon. It forages on fish of up to [...] in length, {{including}} minnows, suckers, gizzard shad, rock bass, alewife, northern pike, whitefish, sauger, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, burbot, walleye, bluegill, <b>white</b> <b>crappie,</b> black crappie, rainbow smelt, and killifish. The young typically eat small minnows, and sometimes insects and fragments of green vegetation. The freshwater diet primarily consists of pike, perch, sunfish, trout, and bass; the saltwater diet primarily consists of rock fish, flounder, sea trout, herring, Atlantic croaker, haddock, and Gulf silverside. When there is either a lack of fish or they are difficult to catch, it preys on crustaceans, crayfish, snails, leeches, insect larvae, molluscs, frogs, annelids, and occasionally aquatic plant matter such as pondweed, roots, moss, willow shoots, seeds, and algae. It has also been known to eat ducklings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} prey {{selection}} by two centrarchids (<b>white</b> <b>crappie</b> and bluegill) {{has been presented}} as a model incorporating optimal foraging strategies by Manatunge & Asaeda [...] The visual field of the foraging fish as represented by the reactive distance was [...] analysed in detail to estimate the number of prey encounters per search bout. The predicted reactive distances were compared with experimental data. The energetic cost associated with fish foraging behaviour was calculated based on {{the sequence of events}} that takes place for each prey consumed. Comparisons of the relative abundance of prey species and size categories in the stomach to the lake environment indicated that both <b>white</b> <b>crappie</b> and bluegill (length < 100nbsp&mm) strongly select prey utilizing an energy optimization strategy. In most cases, the fish exclusively selected large Daphnia ignoring evasive prey types (Cyclops, Diaptomids) and small cladocera. This selectivity is the result of fish actively avoiding prey with high evasion capabilities even though they appear to be high in energetic content and having translated this into optimal selectivity through capture success rates. The energy consideration and visual system, apart from the forager's ability to capture prey, are the major determinants of prey selectivity for large-sized bluegill and <b>white</b> <b>crappie</b> still at planktivorous stages.|$|E
2500|$|The Pomoxis {{species are}} highly {{regarded}} pan fish {{and are often}} considered {{to be among the}} best-tasting freshwater fish. Because of their diverse diets, crappie may be caught in many ways, including casting light jigs, trolling with minnows or artificial lures, using small spinnerbaits, or using bobbers.

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>crappie</b> spawn in May and June. Spawning {{occurs when}} the water {{temperature}} reaches 56 degrees Fahrenheit. Males construct nests by creating small bowl-shaped depressions on the bottom around brush, rocks, and logs in the shallow water. During the spawning season, males develop dark coloration on their throats. Females lay 5,000 to 30,000 eggs.The males guard these nests until the fry swim away. Males guard these nests because it helps ensure {{the success of their}} genes being passed on to the next generation. The <b>white</b> <b>crappie</b> typically grows 3-5 inches within the first year of its life and can grow an additional 3-4 inches in the second year.
