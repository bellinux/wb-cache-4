At the 69th General Assembly of the United Nations, President Nicolas Maduro said [...] "It's President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian {{government}} which have stopped the terrorists" [...] and continued by saying [...] "Instead of bombing and bombing, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> alliance for peace".|$|R

"We are too light, Vicente Yañez," [...] said Columbus, [...] "and, desperate as the {{undertaking}} seemeth, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort to fill our empty casks with sea-water.

Once they were driven back, but came on again, {{and now they}} thrust all Ospakar's men before them and passed up his ship on both boards. By the mast stood Ospakar and with him Gizur his son, and Eric strove to come to him. But many men were between them, {{and he could not}} do this.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, it {{is a poor}} {{heart that}} never rejoices, Terence. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> night of it, boys; if the tents are to be struck before {{daylight}} it will be mighty little use your turning in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that at such a time the Britishers would be over-cautious, and insist on knowing why we lads roamed around instead of {{offering}} our services to those in the entrenchments," [...] Saul said gloomily, and I was much of his mind; but when little Frenchie has once set out on a road it is most difficult to turn him back, and now in answer to our suggestions, he insisted that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort to procure provisions whatever short of actual death might stand in the way.|$|R
40|$|Supernatural beliefs {{relate to}} a Power or powers {{considered}} beyond nature. Persons {{who wish to}} draw upon the power of supernatural forces often attempt to do so through prayers, ceremonies, or special acknowledgement. While some physicians feel uncomfortable at times with beliefs that differ from their own, the chaplaincy system, in place in most hospitals, is evidence that health-care systems can comfortably accommodate supernatural beliefs. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort to understand and accommodate supernatural beliefs other than the Judaeo-Christian tradition and to acknowledge their importance to other cultural groups. A more accepting approach will improve physician-patient relationships...|$|R

6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] {{said the}} course-marker, [...] "in {{order to go}} in a direct line <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> tunnel through this hill, {{immediately}} under the house. This may cause the building to fall in, but the rubbish can be easily removed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Be as 'twill, {{the woman}} is dead and gone, and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> place for her,' said John. 'Come, lads, drink up your ale, and we'll just rid this corner, so as to have all clear for {{beginning}} at the wall, as soon as 'tis light to-morrow.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No; {{they must}} {{have come to the}} same conclusion. As it is, they no doubt think that our clawing out to {{windward}} is of no advantage to us. Now, get another gun over to the larboard side. It is lucky that there is a spare port there. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort to knock one of his spars out, or he may cripple us." [...] For by this time the brigantine had again opened fire. [...] "Let the three best shots we have got lay the guns on her mainmast.

5000|$|It is {{certainly}} true that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> first <b>make</b> <b>a</b> cause our own, egoistic cause, before we can do anything to further it[...] [...] [...] We are communists out of egoism also, and {{it is out of}} egoism that we wish to be human beings, not mere individuals...|$|R
60|$|Thus all our {{previous}} conclusions based on general relativity {{would appear to}} be called in question.

6000|$|... "Form up, form up," [...] Hawtry shouted. [...] "Well together, lads. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> rush {{at those}} beggars ahead.

6000|$|... "How's this, Watson?" [...] he cried, {{picking up}} the paper from the table. [...] "'High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window left. After dusk. G.' That is {{definite}} enough. I think after breakfast <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren's neighbourhood.

6000|$|Jac. The {{best way}} for both were to take up in time; yet I am afraid our forces are engaged so far, that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> battle on't.

6000|$|... "Now, Cuffy," [...] said he, {{patting the}} terrier gently, [...] "rouse up, my doggie; <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> brave {{struggle}} for life.

5000|$|Hume {{develops}} a detailed three-stage psychological {{account of how}} probable reasoning works (i.e., how [...] "the judgment" [...] operates). First, our senses or memory must present us with some object: our confidence in this perception (our [...] "assent") is {{simply a matter of}} its force and vivacity. Second, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> inference, moving from our perception of this object to an idea of another object: since the two objects are perfectly distinct from each other, this inference must draw on past experience of the two objects being observed together again and again. (This [...] "constant conjunction" [...] is promptly filed alongside contiguity and priority, in Hume's still-developing account of our idea of causation.) But what exactly is the process by which we draw on past experience and <b>make</b> <b>an</b> inference from the present object to the other object? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This time, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> try by fire. The {{men must}} gather bundles of firewood, and must attack in three columns; the {{principal}} against the great gate, the others against the two posterns; {{the one at}} the back of the house itself, the other nearest the angle where the wall joins it. If we had time to construct machines for battering the walls, it would be an easy business; but that is out of the question. In a couple of days, at the latest, we shall have them coming out like a swarm of hornets from La Rochelle. It is not likely, when they had all their measures so well prepared, that they omitted to send off word at once to Coligny; and by tomorrow, at noon, we may have Conde and the Admiral upon us. Therefore <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> end of this, by nightfall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{continued}} Hawkeye, {{making a}} hasty sign to repress his impatience; [...] "I am {{much of your}} mind myself; though I thought it becoming my experience to tell the whole. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> then <b>make</b> <b>a</b> push, and if the Indians or Frenchers are in the narrows, run the gauntlet through these toppling mountains.
