40|$|Introduction In {{recent years}} mobile {{communication}} has surpassed all expectations. Availability virtually everywhere in Europe, increasingly favorable prices and <b>world-wide</b> <b>service</b> speak for themselves. Mobile voice communication {{has become a}} mass product. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) is the best known and most widely used mobile communication standard. It is a European development, which has also found global acceptance. Unfortunately, the advance of security standards has not kept pace with the dissemination of mobile communication. In spite of this, the security functions which prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized use are emphasized by the mobile phone companies. Frequently (almost always), the fact that encryption is restricted to the radio transmission is concealed. Disputes between a user and the mobile phone company concerning billing cannot be resolved on a formal basis (e. g. digital signatures of the billing data). The existing mobile communication...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} applications for video-streaming based on P 2 P paradigm (P 2 P-TV) is raising {{the interest of}} both broadcasters and network operators. The former see a promising technology {{to reduce the cost}} of streaming content over the Internet, while offering a <b>world-wide</b> <b>service.</b> The latter instead fear that the traffic offered by these applications can grow without control, affecting other services, and possibly causing network congestion and collapse. The “Network-Aware P 2 P-TV Application over Wise Networks” FP 7 project aims at studying and developing a novel P 2 P-TV application offering the chance to broadcast high definition video to broadcasters and to carefully manage the traffic offered by peers to the network, therefore avoiding worries to Internet providers about network overload. In such context, we design a simulator to evaluate performance of different P 2 P-TV solutions, to compare them both considering end-users ’ and network providers ’ perspectives, such as quality of service perceived by subscribers and link utilization. In this paper, we provide some results that show how effective can be a network aware P 2 P-TV system. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{rapid growth}} in the global service economy has greatly {{increased}} research in Service Science and Service Systems Engineering (SSE). In Service Systems practice, the service value chain in terms of links among system entities is defined to co- create value and deliver high quality of service. A Service System is thus defined by its value co-creation chain in which all relevant stakeholders collaborate dynamically in real time or near-real time to deliver high quality service according to the business, service, and customer goals. This paper illustrates how SSE can help define, and discover relationships among Service System entities and addresses the service-oriented, customer-centric, holistic systems view in order to plan, design, adapt or self- adapt to co-create value. Modern service systems, which may be classified as system of systems (SoS), mandate well-defined integration and governance to link service system entities for the real-time dynamic analysis of ever-changing requirements within a Service System. In this paper, SSE concepts and methodologies are applied across various SSE stages to describe an intelligent emergency transportation system and a near real-time dynamic Smart Grid service system. Additionally, issues which {{need to be addressed}} within SSE methodologies for global deployment of efficient <b>world-wide</b> <b>service</b> systems are discussed. Finally, future work required for improving current SSE methodologies and help steer research towards achieving global service effectiveness is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Service parts {{logistics}} {{is concerned}} with providing support through service parts availability to the after-sales service operations of equipment manufacturers. This dissertation studies strategies and methodologies for managing service parts logistics systems. The approach is to combine extensive field study with rigorous modeling analysis. The research was motivated directly by a project with a major US electronic equipment manufacturer to improve the operations of their <b>world-wide</b> <b>service</b> parts logistics system. ^ The {{first part of the}} dissertation presents our preliminary study of the company 2 ̆ 7 s service parts logistics system. We build two simple models (one for consumables and the other for repairables) to approximate the company 2 ̆ 7 s complex system and to show their effectiveness in providing improved policies. Through this phase of study, we draw important insights regarding applications of operational models to real-world systems and abstract research problems. These new problems are then rigorously analyzed in the next two parts of the dissertation. ^ The second part of the dissertation studies a two-echelon system (a single central repair depot and multiple local inventory stocking centers) for repairables with local-center-dependent depot replenishment lead times. We characterize the system by deriving the various exact performance metrics and then analyze system optimization problems. The following two features in the solution structure differentiate our model fundamentally from those in the literature: (1) the random delays at the depot of local center replenishment orders are different from center to center; (2) the lead time variances have a direct effect on system performance. ^ The third part of the dissertation considers a two-echelon system for repairables with two classes of customer service: an emergency class, where a customer demand needs to be satisfied immediately upon its arrival, and a non-emergency class, where a customer demand needs not to be satisfied until a due date. Using both transient and steady state analysis approaches, we derive exact system performance metrics and characterize various properties. We then carry out numerical studies, based on company data, to quantify and to compare system improvement potential over company practice. ...|$|E

We evaluated the performance of these mechanisms under combinations of two foreground workloads (light and heavy) and two levels of available network bandwidth (10 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s). Our experiments show that even with background traffic sufficient to saturate the network, foreground performance is reduced by at most 4 - 17 %.

40|$|This paper reviews {{candidate}} satellite payload architectures for systems providing <b>world-wide</b> communication <b>services</b> to mobile users {{equipped with}} hand-held terminals based on large geostationary satellites. There {{are a number}} of problems related to the payload architecture, on-board routing and beamforming, and the design of the S-band Tx and L-band Rx antenna and front ends. A number of solutions are outlined, based on trade-offs with respect to the most significant performance parameters such as capacity, G/T, flexibility of routing traffic to beams and re-configuration of the spot-beam coverage, and payload mass and power. Candidate antenna and front-end configurations were studied, in particular direct radiating arrays, arrays magnified by a reflector and active focused reflectors with overlapping feed clusters for both transmit (multimax) and receive (beam synthesis). Regarding the on-board routing and beamforming sub-systems, analog techniques based on banks of SAW filters, FET or CMOS switches and cross-bar fixed and variable beamforming are compared with a hybrid analog/digital approach based on Chirp Fourier Transform (CFT) demultiplexer combined with digital beamforming or a fully digital processor implementation, also based on CFT demultiplexing...|$|R

People attending the emergency department with problems perceived as non-urgent are frequently attributed blame for increased service demand, yet little is known from the patients’ perspective. [Method]This project utilised a descriptive cross-sectional waiting room survey of non-urgent patients to identify factors contributing to their decision making process to access ED services at a regional hospital in Tasmania, Australia. Data were analysed using a statistical software package and comparison made between the sample and population groups to determine broad representation.
