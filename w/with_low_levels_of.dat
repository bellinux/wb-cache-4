5|$|The isotope plutonium-238 has a {{half-life}} of 87.74years. It emits a {{large amount}} of thermal energy <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> both gamma rays/photons and spontaneous neutron rays/particles. Being an alpha emitter, it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238. One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat.|$|E
5|$|In {{developed}} countries, people <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> education {{living in}} poorer areas are {{most at risk}} for elevated lead. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. African-American children and those living in old housing have also {{been found to be}} at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces {{the risk that the}} value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E

It is widespread but generally uncommon throughout Europe, although there may be local areas where it is common. In Britain, H.ferrugineum is provisionally classified as endangered, and is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981; it was included as one of 14 species considered in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan for stipitate hydnoid fungi (i.e., hydnoid fungi with a cap and stipe) in 2004. The fungus is protected in Montenegro. It has been collected in India and North Africa.|$|E
