Rogers and Leykis became rivals and, in June 1984, just after Denver {{radio talk show host}} Alan Berg was assassinated, Leykis told listeners Neil Rogers' real name and urged callers to harass his on-air rival.

25|$|A Yakima Chief, Qualchan, who was disgruntled {{following}} {{the loss of}} the Yakima War to the U.S. Army, gathered the Colville, the Coeur d'Alene, the Columbia River, and the Kalispel tribes at a council in order to convince the tribes that the white man was encroaching on their lands and that they needed to defend them. The Coeur d’Alene and other tribes subsequently held a council discussing their concerns that the army would invade their territory {{as a result of the}} growing tensions. A line was drawn at the Snake River, agreeing that if the army crossed it, they would have effectively crossed into the Indians’ territory, and this would be considered a hostile action. Interestingly, the Coeur d’Alene tribe was split in their feelings toward war. The tribal leaders did not want war, fearing that the consequences to their people <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating,</b> while the younger warriors, led by Milkapsi, were angry and wanted to fight.|$|E

25|$|Moses's {{power was}} further eroded by his {{association}} with the 1964 New York World's Fair. His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties {{in the face of}} evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities. In his organization of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way in moments of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> {{to the success of the}} event. Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate. The United States had already staged the sanctioned Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962. According to the rules of the organization, no one nation could host more than one fair in a decade. The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for Expo 67 in Montreal.|$|E

Analysts at French bank BNP Paribas added that the fallout from a Greek exit would wipe 20% off Greece's GDP, increase Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio to over 200%, and send inflation soaring to 40–50%. Also UBS warned of hyperinflation, a bank run and even [...] "military coups and possible civil war that could afflict a departing country".

Emergency planner Bill Thomison feels skeptical about a major earthquake, stating, [...] "I don't believe there are any major faults (interface of rocks) here. It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the Richter scale. You could have a No. 4 (magnitude) earthquake in California and not damage anything, but the same type in New York could be devastating because the building codes don't factor in earthquakes." ...|$|E

500|$|With the {{validity}} of the agreement in question, the tribes, joined by the Indian Rights Association (IRA) and local ranchers, lobbied against its ratification by Congress. [...] The IRA wrote letters to Senators, stating that the agreement was: [...] "utterly destructive of that honor and good faith which should characterize our dealings with any people, and especially with one too weak to enforce their rights as against us by any other mean as than an appeal to our sense of justice." [...] The Secretary of the Interior informed Congress that the allotment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to the tribes, as the land was not suited to farming, and the amount of land allotted would not allow them sufficient land to graze cattle.

[...] Rossendale Borough Council leader Duncan Ruddick representing the electoral ward of Worsley in Rossendale, the proposed site of the new wind farm, said he was against wind farms and would be campaigning against it and speaking at the Development Control committee when it came. The leader of the Labour local councillors was also opposed to the plan, saying that he was concerned {{about the size of the}} turbines and that the visual impact on the [...] "beautiful West Pennine Moors" [...] <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> Planning permission for the development was granted by Hyndburn Council in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{suggested}} that Andrew Cuomo's primary {{run in the}} 2010 gubernatorial election against incumbent David Paterson, {{who was the first}} African-American governor of New York, would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising 2002 gubernatorial primary contest against Carl McCall, at the time the highest-ranking African-American and first major party candidate for governor in the state. Rangel had been a staunch supporter of McCall against Cuomo in 2002, even going as far as saying that he would not necessarily endorse Cuomo had he emerged as the Democratic nominee for governor. For the upcoming 2010 gubernatorial race, Rangel {{suggested that}} for the white Cuomo to challenge the African-American incumbent would not be [...] "the moral decision". [...] Rangel also said, [...] "There might be an inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. Since we have most African-Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> in my opinion." [...] Paterson fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election.

A common system in place with marriage is the Dowry system in which a low or no status is assigned to a girl right from the prenatal stage.There are issues around the dowry system such as dowry related violence, in which the wife is abused by her husband. Before the marriage, the groom will make heavy financial demands on the bride's family {{as a condition of}} marrying their daughter. In order for many parents' daughters to get married, they start [...] "obtaining loans from people, getting interest based loans from banks, utilising their life savings and even sell their homes,"(JAHEZ (Dowry Conditions Set by the Groom for Marriage)).

2500|$|In {{terms of}} the {{financial}} reform, since the recession, Hoover {{had been trying to}} repair the economy. He founded government agencies to encourage labor harmony and support local public works aid which promoted cooperation of government and business, stabilize prices, and strive to balance the budget. His work focused on indirect relief from individual countries and the private sector, which was reflected in the letter emphasizing [...] "more effective supporting for each national committee" [...] and volunteer service -" [...] appealing for funding" [...] from outside the government. The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money supply operations in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing budgetary action to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money. Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens. During the administration of Hoover, the US economic policies had moved to activism and interventionism.
