5|$|Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{located in}} the arid and sparsely {{populated}} Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile – concerns of erosion caused by tourists {{have led to the}} closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives <b>work</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E

In October 1967 the Australian government announced it would increase the size of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) at Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province from two to three infantry battalions, while additional supporting arms, including a tank squadron would also be added to the force. As such in February 1968, C Squadron was sent to Vietnam, with a total strength of 20 Centurion tanks which would <b>work</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> M113s of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. However, two of the four tank troops were initially held back until the Centurions had proved themselves capable of operating in the conditions. The tank squadron reached full strength on 5 September 1968. Meanwhile, in May {{the regiment}} had again reached full strength, with A Squadron re-raised {{in order to meet the}} ongoing operational commitment.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1944, {{troops of}} the {{division}} in Tetovo and Gostivar mutinied, killing their German officers and NCOs. By this time, the division numbered fewer than 7,000 men, which was less than one-third of its intended strength. Within two months of its initial deployment, 3,500 men had deserted. Himmler brought in 3,000–4,000 Kriegsmarine (German navy) personnel from Greece {{to make up the}} numbers, but this had little effect on the division's fighting ability. By the beginning of October 1944, the division's strength had fallen to about 4,900 men, fewer than 1,500 of whom were fit for combat. Schmidhuber held his men in contempt, and he, his superiors, and Fitzthum explained their failure to create an effective security force by denigrating the Albanian culture and military reputation. Later, less-involved members of the Wehrmacht stated that the principal issue regarding the unit's reliability may have been that the Germans did not <b>work</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Albanians at the local level. In mid-October, it was engaged in heavy fighting around Đakovica. By this time, desertions had significantly affected the division's strength and its 86 officers and 467 NCOs were left with a force of only 899 men, about half of whom were Albanian. On 24 October, Generaloberst Alexander Löhr, the commander of Army Group E, ordered that all Albanian members of the division be disarmed and released.|$|E
