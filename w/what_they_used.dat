Regardless, the duo wanted to release a record for the summer, reasoning that they felt [...] "strange" [...] not issuing any material to the public in that season. Therefore, they created and distributed a three-track [...] "clubby" [...] extended play that went [...] "back to the start." [...] Moog for Love was Disclosure's first record not to feature writing contributions from Jimmy Napes, which Howard said also [...] "feels quite strange." [...] With the EP, Disclosure wanted to use more different track development formulas from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> for making their previous records, Settle (2013) and Caracal (2015), reasoning that they would be making the same music over and over again if they kept making tracks the same way. However, they still had made songs in one similar way they did for Settle, in that there was some material only one of the members would work on, and after the song was finished, both members of the duo would decide if the track was ready for release and inclusion on the album.|$|E

500|$|Blink-182 {{returned}} to Interscope Records {{to distribute the}} album, but found the music industry landscape dramatically different since the band's last effort. [...] "The label itself has no resources or capital to do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> to," [...] DeLonge {{said in an interview}} with Billboard, [...] "They just have you locked up on a contract." [...] Interscope, since the band's break-up, had greatly pared down its rock department, in contrast to other labels. Blink-182 broke up at a heightened popularity period for pop punk, but Neighborhoods was released in an era for the genre in which Billboard described as [...] "lacking exciting mainstream representation," [...] in addition to falling sales for peer bands. The band approached sponsorships, song releases and social media incorporation during the rollout of Neighborhoods. Social media such as Facebook and Twitter were present throughout each stage of the album, which Hoppus believed allowed more direct access and control over the band's music. Although Modlife, DeLonge's revenue-sharing online service, was not involved in the promotion of the record, the band's personal business projects were integrated, such as Macbeth Footwear and Famous Stars and Straps. Retailers such as Hot Topic and Interpunk.com carried different-colored vinyl editions of Neighborhoods that included MP3 download cards. The band partnered with AT in order to promote the album, appearing in a national spot for the HTC Status; the band also partnered with Best Buy, which sold a uniquely colored HTC Status preloaded with the band's music. Television ads through networks such as ESPN were explored the week of release. In addition, Hoppus and DeLonge appeared in a [...] "film festival" [...] for the fan montage video of [...] "Up All Night", honoring various Internet fans through tongue-in-cheek categories.|$|E

[...] Yuwen falsely {{stated that the}} rebels {{had been reduced to}} less than 10% of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> to be. [...] Su initially declined to answer the question, but after Emperor Yang insisted on hearing his answer, he responded that while he did not know the numbers, the rebels were getting closer to Luoyang—and that, further, the taxes and labor levies were severely decreased due to rebel activities. [...] He further pointed out that Emperor Yang was reneging on his promise to stop considering campaigns against Goguryeo. [...] Emperor Yang was displeased. [...] Further, at Duanwu Festival, while the other officials submitted treasures as gifts to the emperor, Su submitted a copy of the Classic of History. [...] Emperor Yang was displeased when someone pointed out that the Classic of History contained a chapter entitled the Song of the Five Sons -- a lament by the five brothers of King Taikang of Xia Dynasty that he lost his kingdom due to his excessive cruelty and hunting—and believed that Su was criticizing him. [...] He was further incensed when Su, while discussing the issue of another campaign against Goguryeo, sarcastically suggested that if Emperor Yang pardoned all of the agrarian rebels, there would be hundreds of thousands of soldiers available to attack Goguryeo. [...] Emperor Yang thereafter complained about Su to Pei Yun, and Pei Yun then had a man named Zhang Xingben (張行本) accuse Su of inappropriate promotions and fear of Tujue. [...] Emperor Yang removed Su from his posts, and then further accusations that Su was conspiring with Tujue were made. [...] Emperor Yang had Pei Yun investigate it, and Pei proposed that Su be executed. [...] Su, unable to prove his innocence, begged for forgiveness. [...] Emperor Yang took pity and released him, but stripped him of citizenship rights, along with his descendants for three generations. [...] Soon, however, it appeared that Su was restored to some extent, as he accompanied Emperor Yang to Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in 617, although he was not restored to his posts, as Pei Yun and Yu suggested to Emperor Yang that Su was too old to be effective.|$|E
