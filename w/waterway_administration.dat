The conical design of the tower was intended to minimize exposure to waves and drift ice. The German <b>Waterway</b> <b>Administration,</b> the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt (WSA) Bremerhaven as the responsible governmental agency, assigned the task of workmanship to a cooperative of companies: Philipp Holzmann, Strabag Bau AG, Hermann Moeller.

50|$|The West German {{shipping}} canals {{serve the}} mass transportation in the Ruhr region between the rivers Rhine and Ems direction North sea and via the Mittelland Canal to the Weser, Elbe, Oder and Vistula.This canal network shows the highest traffic density in Europe. The canals are state-owned by the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung”).The construction of artificial shipping canals was {{necessary in the}} industrialisation period of the Ruhr due to lacking transportation routes via capable, navigable rivers. The oldest part, the Dortmund-Ems Canal, is connecting the eastern Ruhr since 1898 with the North Sea. In 1914 the connection to the Rhine followed via the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Datteln-Hamm Canal was opened, too. In 1930 the Wesel-Datteln Canal was finished. All these connected waterways need to bridge altitude differences between the starting point, the connected harbours and the arrival point. For these purposes there are today e.g at the Rhine-Herne Canal 5 sluices and at the Wesel-Datteln Canal 6 sluices; at the Henrichenburg boat lift two ancient and two actually utilized sluices facilitate the bypassing of the altitude difference within the Dortmund-Ems-Kanal to Dortmund harbour. To feed the planned canal system with water already in 1905 before {{the construction of the}} Datteln-Hamm Canal the decision was passed by the Prussian State to use 10 m³/second water from the river Lippe - the only relevant river in the area - for the compensation of evaporation, infiltration and loss of water from the sluices). That was leading from 1914 on to severe water management problems in the river Lippe where in dry summers only 4 m³/second water was left downstream. From 1926 on the newly established water board Lippeverband negotiated with the competent authorities and finally the governmental <b>waterway</b> <b>administration</b> (“Reichswasserstraßenverwaltung”) confirmed to reduce the water abstraction to 7,5 m³/second from 1938 on. The industrial development of the coal and steel industry and especially the coal-fired power stations after World War II meant a growing demand of service water (from the canals and the river Lippe) and a growing discharge of too warm and/or unsatisfactory treated waste water into the river Lippe. Negotiations of the Lippeverband with the government of North Rhine Westphalia and with the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung) were finally from 1968 on leading to new regulations: The ’’Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle’’ WWK was established, consisting of representatives of the Lippeverband and the water users, accompanied by the Federal Waterways Authority and the Environment Ministry of North Rhine Westphalia. Moreover, the permission for maximum discharge of the Lippe into the West German canal system was increased to 10 m³/second again but now with the additional limitation to guarantee a minimum discharge of 10 m³/second in the Lippe, too, otherwise the water abstraction for the canals had to be limited. This regulation was possible because of already constructed pumps at the sluices that started compensating partly the loss of water from locking.In the years 1973-1978 a series of new pumping stations was established that could serve the canals “upstream” from the rivers Rhine and Ruhr and discharge “downstream” in case the Lippe has enough water to supply with. Parallel pumping systems had been developed along the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Wesel-Datteln Canal/ Datteln-Hamm Canal, all controlled and supervised from a centralized telecontrol station.|$|E

40|$|The Scheldt estuary is {{a unique}} tidal estuary. The river {{originates}} from France and flows through Belgium and the Netherlands. The tide creates important flood risks in the Flanders region, including {{for the city of}} Antwerp. The Flemish government wants to update its flood protection policy, based on a cost-efficient reduction of risks of flooding and taking into account sea level rise. Against this background, the Flemish <b>Waterway</b> <b>Administration</b> commissioned a cost-benefit analysis of flood protection measures. To this purpose a series of models of different scientific disciplines was integrated within a cost-benefit analysis framework. Results of cost-calculation, hydraulic, ecological and agricultural models were integrated in a cost-benefit model. Protection against flooding was evaluated on a risk based approach. This means that not only probabilities of flooding were considered but also possible damages sustained by flooding. Consequently a non-homogeneous level of security was allowed. Measures evaluated include storm surge barriers nearby Antwerp or on tributaries, dike heightening and creating controlled inundation areas (floodplains). Constructing reduced tide areas which allows creation of new wetlands was also assessed. Benefits of nature development were taken into account when comparing costs and benefits of these measures. An optimal flood protection strategy was developed, and the optimal solution was tested using different kinds of uncertainty analyses {{for a wide variety of}} technical and economic parameters. The analysis showed that cost-benefit analysis is a very useful approach to assist decision-making processes on designing flood protection measures and this approach is certainly applicable to other estuaries...|$|E

40|$|The {{waterway}} axis Rhine/Meuse-Main-Danube crosses Europe transversally {{from the}} North Sea at Rotterdam to the Black Sea in Romania. This corridor {{is one of}} the longest ones in the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and crosses both EU countries and non-Member States. In order to increase the transport capacity along this axis, many projects are supported by the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency as part of the priority project 18. The increase of the lock capacity of the Meuse River in Belgium to reach class ECMT VIb, allowing the traffic of boats carrying up to 9, 000 tonnes, {{is one of the}}se projects. The new lock at Ampsin-Neuville will have a 225 m x 25 m chamber, with a 4. 70 m head. This lock will be built between an existing 136 m x 16 m lock and the weir. As the existing lock is equipped with lateral translation gates, these gates recesses constrain significantly the location of the new lock. Therefore, a through-the-head filling system has been preferred to the longitudinal culvert system selected for similar locks on the River Meuse. This paper focuses on the design of the upstream head of this new lock, equipped with short culverts and a dissipation chamber. In order to guide the design of this filling system, a scale model of the lock head has been set-up at the Hydraulics Research Laboratory of Walloon <b>waterways</b> <b>administration.</b> The specific aim of this model was to investigate different configurations of the conduit network and of the dissipation chamber in order to limit the hawser forces encountered by vessels in the lock chamber, through a reduction of waves and free-surface slopes in the lock itself, and a sufficient uniformity in flow distribution at the dissipation chamber outlet. A composite modelling approach has been used in conjunction with this physical model to optimise the design. The key parameter {{in the design of the}} dissipation chamber was the placement of energy and momentum dissipation devices. In order to guide this design, and to limit the number of tests in the scale model, 2 D numerical simulations of the flow inside the chamber were run in a variety of configurations such as e. g. longitudinal walls, square columns in aligned or staggered layout, round columns in aligned and staggered layouts. The best options were tested in the scale model. Head-losses and velocity distribution at the exit of the dissipation chamber were measured, for different combinations of upstream water level and discharge through the culverts, representative of different stages of the filling process. The measurements were finally compared with the predictions by the numerical models...|$|R

This includes, for example, measurements to assess the transport of fine and medium sand, as the bed-load collectors used in the included studies have a mesh size larger than those particles. To estimate the amount of sand that was not captured in the previous studies, bed-load collectors identical in construction were installed in the tilted flume at IWW and flushed with water and a defined sediment mixture, representative of the Rhine bed. Comparing the dry weights of the sediments accumulated in the collector and those initially applied revealed average sand losses between 10 and 50 % {{depending on the type of}} collector used and the composition of the bed-load sample. Based on these results, a correction factor was determined to allow for adjusting previously acquired data to display the actual amount of transported sand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sensor {{networks}} are important infrastructures for monitoring environmental systems {{on a routine}} basis. In response to climate change and adaptation strategies, environmental monitoring data is becoming increasing valuable as a mean for observing the impact on natural systems. Recent flood events in Europe (e. g. the Elbe floods in 2002 and 2006) show that environmental monitoring and subsequent data analysis lack standardized procedures for data availability and system interoperability. The existing systems do not fully meet the demands for in-time warning, efficient alerting and informing the public. One of the major hydrological monitoring networks in Germany is operated by the Federal <b>Waterway</b> and Shipment <b>Administration,</b> which belongs to the Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs. Additional hydrological monitoring systems are operated on state and local water board level. The analysis of the different networks shows that a common architecture and a system interoperability using standardized data description and data servicing is missing. In most cases, the monitoring data is exchanged via E-mail or ftp in different data formats. Different web service solutions are just developing. Global climate change research projects as well as increasing natural hazards (see the mentioned Elbe floods) have put an additional pressure on the different stakeholders to closely line up recent environmental monitoring systems with emerging technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} effects of erosion, movement and deposition of sediment can be serious. The variation in drainage basin and precipitation characteristics results in {{significant differences in the}} quantity of fluvial sediment. This difference requires the manager of the navigable <b>waterways</b> in Flanders (<b>Administration</b> of <b>Waterways</b> and Marine Affairs, AWZ) to monitor the suspended sediment transport at the upstream boundaries of its territory. This monitoring network provides sediment data {{that can be used to}} (1) evaluate the effects of landmanagement practices that will reduce erosion rates, (2) determine the morphological effects of riverbed enlargment measures, (3) estimate the quantities to be dredged (4) fulfill the monitoring aspects of the EU Water Framework Directive, (5) enlarge the knowledge of the watersystem and (6) provide basic information for treatment of dredging material. The approach consists of a continuous hourly monitoring method completed with topographical cross section measurements, measurements of turbidity samples, calibration of the turbidity monitor and correlation between local turbidity and cross section turbidity. Finally sediment transport is calculated from turbidity and validated discharge measurements. Sediment data were collected at eight stations from 1999. Data for 1999 and 2000 were published in the annual report. Data collection at different locations and processing of sediment samples will continue.

40|$|The Kiel Canal {{connects the}} North and Baltic seas and is {{ranked among the}} world’s three major canals. In fact, in terms of traffic, it is the busiest {{artificial}} waterway worldwide. In a billion Euro project, the German Federal <b>Waterways</b> and Shipping <b>Administration</b> plans to enlarge the canal during the coming years. This project is about contributing to a well-founded advise on how the enlargement can be optimally done. In order to evaluate the various construction possibilities it is indispensable to first provide an accurate model for the ship traffic and designing an algorithm which (ideally optimally) controls it. This paper is about such optimal traffic control. The problem very roughly is as follows. There is bi-directional ship traffic on the canal; there are several locks at both ends. Ships are classified in different size categories. Passing and overtaking is allowed only if the sizes of the two ships do not exceed a given threshold which depends on the meeting point. If otherwise a conflict occurs, ships have to wait at designated, capacitated places, the sidings. The objective is to minimize the total passage time, including lock and siding waiting times. The overall scheduling is currently done by two teams of experienced planners, one for the locks, one for the sidings. In this abstract we concentrate on the latter problem, but both will be treated in an integrated way during the project. Despite significant differences there are certain similarities to train scheduling on a single track line [1]...|$|R
40|$|Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) {{is part of}} the {{critical}} infrastructure necessary for the safety and efficient of vessel movements, especially in congested areas such as the North Sea. GNSS (primarily GPS and GLONASS) has become the primary PNT source for maritime operations. The GNSS position is used both for vessel navigation and as the position source for AIS. Unfortunately, GNSS is vulnerable to jamming and interference – not intentional and unintentional. This can lead to the loss of positioning information or even worse, to incorrect positioning information. The user requirement is for dependable PNT information at all times, even under GNSS jamming conditions. One potential source of resilient PNT services is Ranging Mode (R-Mode) using signals independent of GNSS. The German Federal <b>Waterways</b> and Shipping <b>Administration</b> has contracted for a feasibility study of R-mode using MF-DGNSS and VHF AIS signals as well as those signals in combination and in combination with eLoran. The first part of the study focused on the feasibility of using MF-DGNSS signals for ranging and timing. It examined the state of the art, identified potential solution methods, and, after examining Pros and Cons of the various options, selected a few options for further study. Part 2 examined the proposed solutions in depth and identified the modifications required for both the reference stations (transmitters) and user equipment (beacon receivers). Part 3 and 4 of the study repeated Parts 1 and 2, but using AIS signals rather than MF. Part 4 of the study examined the possibility of combining MF and AIS R-mode or combining MF R-Mode and eLoran.

40|$|Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) {{is part of}} the {{critical}} infrastructure necessary for the safety and efficiency of vessel movements, especially in congested areas such as the North Sea. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), especially the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS), have become the primary PNT sources for maritime operations. The GNSS position is used both for vessel navigation and as the position and timing source for other systems such as Automatic Identification System (AIS). Unfortunately, GNSS is vulnerable to jamming and interference, intentional or not, which can lead to the loss of positioning information or, even worse, to incorrect positioning information. The user requirement is for dependable PNT information at all times. One potential source of resilient PNT services is Ranging Mode (R-Mode), an alternative PNT concept related to Signals of OPportunity (SoOP) PNT, which uses signals independent of GNSS. In 2013 the German Federal <b>Waterways</b> and Shipping <b>Administration</b> contracted for a feasibility study of R-Mode using medium frequency (MF) Differential GNSS (DGNSS) and very high frequency (VHF) AIS signals as well as those signals in combination and in combination with eLoran. At ION GNSS+ 2014 some of the authors presented the results from that feasibility study and showed the projected performance using the signals individually and in combination. In most of the shipping lanes on the North Sea it appeared that 10 m or better performance could be achieved. Following up on that work, prototypes of a transmitter and receiver for MF-DGNSS R-Mode have been developed. The transmitter was installed in IJmuiden (Netherlands) and the receiver deployed along the Dutch coast to the south of the transmitter for initial on-air testing of the R-Mode concept; both were synchronized to UTC via GPS. While positioning is not possible with only one R-Mode transmitter, the combination of a synchronized transmitter and receiver pair allows for useful testing of the R-Mode concept. Specifically, the receiver could estimate a true range (rather than a pseudorange); hence, the stability of the range with environmental variations (e. g. weather, day/night skywave effects, etc.) can be studied. To further study skywave effects, the R-Mode modulator was relocated to a more powerful transmitter at Heligoland (Germany) and the receiver moved to a location near the Kiel Canal (Germany). A second receiver was installed at a similar distance from the transmitter to enable simultaneous comparison of two different propagation paths. Later a third receiver was added in order to provide three paths of different lengths. The original R-Mode feasibility study also examined the number of stations that {{it would be possible to}} receive in the North Sea area to ensure there were sufficient stations for positioning. However, it did not look at the converse question; how would a large number of R-Mode signals impact legacy users. As part of the prototype development, very limited experiments were performed to assess the impact of the new signals on legacy DGNSS receivers. Specifically, during the on-air testing mentioned above, a commercial DGNSS receiver was able to accurately demodulate and decode the on-air transmissions from the single prototype R-Mode transmitter; the impact of multiple signals was not examined. A new study, funded by the General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland, has just been initiated to analyze how legacy equipment would respond to multiple R-Mode signals at different frequencies, both in-band and out-of-band. This paper presents details of the prototype transmitter and receiver and includes statistical analyses of the range estimates recorded to date and the impact of skywave interference at night using data from the German test sites. Additionally, this paper includes preliminary results of the R-Mode signal interference study...|$|R
