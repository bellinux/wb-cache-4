5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, <b>what</b> <b>began</b> as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the Sandbar Fight. <b>What</b> <b>began</b> as a duel between two other men {{deteriorated}} into a melée in which Bowie, having been shot and stabbed, killed the sheriff of Rapides Parish with a large knife. This, and other stories of Bowie's prowess with a knife, led to the widespread popularity of the Bowie knife.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. <b>What</b> <b>began</b> as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the unrest as it spread along the rail lines from city to city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal intervention to quell.|$|E

25|$|Separately, the City of Vancouver also {{pushed for}} the sale of Japanese-Canadian {{properties}} in the Powell Street “ghetto” to allow for redevelopment in the area. <b>What</b> <b>began</b> with discussions in the summer of 1942 about city-level urban renewal was quickly co-opted by the federal government in attempt to sell all Japanese-Canadian properties, far beyond what the City of Vancouver had initially suggested.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church has {{the oldest}} {{continuously}} functioning legal {{system in the}} West, much later than Roman law but predating the evolution of modern European civil law traditions. <b>What</b> <b>began</b> with rules ("canons") adopted by the Apostles at the Council of Jerusalem {{in the first century}} has developed into a highly complex legal system encapsulating not just norms of the New Testament, but some elements of the Hebrew (Old Testament), Roman, Visigothic, Saxon, and Celtic legal traditions.

In the 1930s, people in New England were turning to music on the radio; as a result, interest in traditional songs was on the wane. Flanders understood that unless these songs were collected and recorded for posterity, they would die along with the people who sang them. <b>What</b> <b>began</b> as a committee assignment became not just a hobby, but a passion.
