2500|$|Predating {{the modern}} age of pornography, facials were {{described}} in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing facials in his work The 120 Days of Sodom, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads [...] "... I show them my prick, then <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I do? I squirt the fuck in their face... That's my passion my child, I have no other... and you're about to behold it." ...|$|E

He [...] {{sits and}} listens and I read books, because I know {{perfectly}} well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose?</b> Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.|$|E

[...] <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I would intimate {{to you in}} a hundred ways, but [...] that man or woman is as good as God? [...] And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself? [...] And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean? [...] And that you or any one must approach creations through such laws? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, taking <b>you</b> by-and-large, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{seem to be}} more {{different}} kinds of an ass than any creature I ever saw before. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> he wanted to know for?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{me about}} your wife, Alderling," [...] I said, and he {{answered}} {{with a sort of}} scream, [...] "I wanted you to ask me! Why didn't you ask me before? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I got <b>you</b> here for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{ought to}} require no consideration," [...] said Mr. Clavering, rising from his chair--"none at all; not a moment's. Heavens and earth! Why, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> were to live upon? But I won't discuss it. I {{will not say}} one more word upon a subject which is so distasteful to me. You must excuse me if I leave you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "Oh, Willis, don't torment me! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> it means? Is it some--mistake? It's for {{somebody}} else!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My good young friend--for <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> {{a benevolent}} {{publisher}} undertakes a critical journal, to benefit his rival?" [...] Shandon inquired.|$|E
6000|$|DR. JONATHAN. A {{good many}} of your friends have enlisted, haven't they? (RENCH nods.) And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> they are {{fighting}} for? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Breakfast!" [...] echoed Mavering. [...] "Well, now, Boardman, <b>what</b> use <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I've got {{for breakfast}} under the circumstances?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} on my guard next time.... I see Mr. Bartol in the doorway. Don't you think we'd better go in? <b>What</b> time <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{did leave}} by it," [...] Lenora declared. [...] "He is {{in a state}} of panic at the present moment. <b>What</b> else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> he was out there {{listening}} for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another finger {{from the}} Professor's skeleton," [...] he announced, [...] "has been found just outside his grounds. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> that means?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] {{said the}} unreflecting captain; [...] "money is the thing, after all. Now <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> our last mess-bill came to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{whatever}} {{you may have}} heard or seen, nobody else is in doubt about it. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> has brought Mr. Mavering here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, sir," [...] Mr. Hamilton Fynes declared. [...] "I {{am sure that}} my friends {{on the other side}} will {{appreciate}} your attention. By <b>what</b> time <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> that we shall reach London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|LARRY. In {{either case}} {{it would be}} an impertinence, Mr Keegan, as your {{approval}} is not of the slightest consequence to us. <b>What</b> use <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> all this drivel is to men with serious practical business in hand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] she said, [...] "you {{have been}} asleep and dreamed these foolish things; or if not, these yokels to whom {{you have been}} {{listening}} are mad. <b>What</b> harm <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> could come to Lord Ronald here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me as though I have just had a glimpse of Dresden. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> could have {{suggested}} that city to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Real Indian!" [...] said Mr. Touchwood, in {{an accent}} of disdain, which rather {{disturbed}} Mrs. Blower's equanimity,--"why, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> it should be, madam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you? Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> he does {{think of}} it all? You ought to {{understand}} the man's part of it better than I can." ...|$|E

5000|$|Under Yagüe's {{direction}} {{thousands of}} prisoners and civilians, including women and children, were executed in Badajoz and buried in common graves, during the Badajoz massacre, {{in one of}} the biggest massacres by the Nationalists of the war. Before leaving the city, Yagüe was asked by the American journalist John T. Whitaker about his reason for killing all those people (10% of the city's population) and he answered: [...] "Of course that we have killed them. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose?</b> Will I take 4,000 red prisoners with my column, having to advance against the clock? Or will I leave them in my rearguard so that Badajoz will be red another time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ellen! I {{will not}} have this!" [...] cried her mother, frantic at the reproach. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean by my letting you?

6000|$|... "You'll be {{all right}} in half-an-hour. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I'd want to kill you for?" [...] said the doctor, who came of a logical breed.|$|E
6000|$|SIR PEARCE [sitting down again, {{exhausted}} by his feelings]. Well, I {{never could have}} believed this. Never. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> will happen when she finds out? ...|$|E
6000|$|Something in {{the tone}} in which Mrs. Nettlepoint said this caused me to exclaim in real surprise, 'Why, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> she has in her mind?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> would <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Harry, <b>supposing</b> <b>you</b> {{were really}} quite in earnest, {{and she laughed}} in your face and told you you were a boy?" [...] Dick asked.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You know <b>what</b> I mean. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> old Miriam carries letters {{without taking}} care {{to know what is}} inside them? Will he apostatise? Tell me. I am secret as the grave!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Waal, chief," [...] Pearson said, [...] "we're {{in a tight}} hole, I grant you; but I'm {{far from}} {{allowing}} that we aint no chances left to us yet. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> propose? I <b>suppose</b> you've some proposition to make." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can't even bear that; {{it seems}} like a part of me. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> they said of me?" [...] she asked, in morbid curiosity.|$|E

6000|$|As I {{laid down}} the Proceedings on the breakfast table with a sigh, I said to my wife (who had been looking over my {{shoulder}} while I read): [...] "Now, Nora, we're really in for it. <b>What</b> on earth <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I'd better do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't talk nonsense," [...] he exclaimed, {{flushing}} {{with sudden}} energy, [...] "I mean <b>what</b> I say. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I can calmly allow that dear girl to sacrifice {{herself to a}} mere wreck, that cannot hope to be long a cumberer of the ground?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{glad to see}} you!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} almost vehemently. [...] "Why, <b>what</b> else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I come here for every Thursday evening?
