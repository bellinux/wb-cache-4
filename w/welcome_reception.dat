500|$|In 1991, she {{appeared}} in , the first directorial venture of actor Nana Patekar, with whom she would collaborate in several other films. The film, co-starring Patekar and Madhuri Dixit, received a <b>welcome</b> <b>reception</b> from critics. Kapadia was noted for her [...] "deglamourised role", {{but most of the}} praise went to the performance of Patekar himself. Kapadia starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in Shashi Kapoor's fantasy Ajooba, an Indo-Russian co-production based on Arabian mythology and set in the Afghan kingdom of Baharistan. She played Rukhsana, a young woman who comes from India to rescue her father, court magician Ameer Baba, from prison. The critical response to Ajooba was mostly lukewarm. She played the protagonist in Haque (1991), a political drama directed by Harish Bhosle and scripted by Mahesh Bhatt. Her role was that of Varsha B. Singh, a pregnant Orthodox woman married to an influential politician. Ram Awatar Agnihotri said of her performance, [...] "Dimple Khapadia, playing Varsha, very bravely, tries to make her role look convincing, and she succeeds to a great extent. It is a tribute to her as an actress".|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{proceeded}} to the 1953 Ashes tour, travelling to England aboard the Orcades after leaving Australia in late March. They almost {{did so with}} their three main bowlers marooned in an Italian jail. During a stopover at Naples on the sea voyage to England, Miller had taken Lindwall and Johnston to watch a rehearsal of La Boheme at the Teatro di San Carlo. The trio ignored the doorkeeper's attempt to stop them attending what {{was meant to be}} a private rehearsal, and proceeded inside to the auditorium. When they attempted to return to the boat, they found that the doorkeeper had locked them inside and called the police. Lindwall broke the door's lock and the pacemen ran back to the dock just before the gangplank was being pulled away. The Australians arrived at Southampton after four weeks at sea. He was embroiled in further controversy when Bumper, a book that he had produced with his ghost-writer Dick Whitington, criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious. The book commented that [...] "Hassett deals, or fails to deal with things as they occur". Early on the tour, the Evening News ran the headline [...] "Keith Miller Criticises his Captain". The poker-faced Hassett kept his cool at a <b>welcome</b> <b>reception</b> hosted by the Journalists' Association, introducing Miller to the guests by saying [...] "There is Keith Miller, whom you all know well.

60|$|The colonists, generally, {{gave the}} two {{recruits}} a very <b>welcome</b> <b>reception.</b> Bridget smiled when Mark suggested that Jones, {{who was a}} well-looking lad enough, would make a very proper husband for Joan, and that he doubted not his being called on, in his character of magistrate, to unite them {{in the course of}} the next six months. The designs of the savages, however, caused the party to think of anything but weddings, just at that moment, and a council was held to devise a plan for their future government. As Mark was considered the head of the colony, and had every way the most experience, his opinion swayed those of his companions, and all his recommendations were adopted. There were on board the ship eight carronades, then quite a new gun, and mounted on trucks. They were of the bore of twelve-pounders, but light and manageable, There was also abundance of ammunition in the vessel's magazine, no ship coming to the Fejees to trade without a proper regard to the armament. Mark proposed going over to the Reef with the Neshamony, the very next day, in order to transport two of the guns, with a proper supply of powder and shot, to the Peak. Now there was one place on the path, or Stairs, where it would be easy to defend the last against an army, the rocks, which were absolutely perpendicular on each side of it, coming so close together, as to render it practicable to close the passage by a narrow gate. This gate Mark did not purpose to erect now, for he thought it unnecessary. All he intended was to plant the two guns at this pass; one on a piece of level rock directly over it, and a little on one side, which would command the entrance of the cove, and the cove itself, as well as the whole of the path beneath, and the other on another natural platform, a short distance above, where it could not only command the pass, but, by using the last as a sort of embrasure, by firing through it, could not only sweep the ravine for some distance down, but could also rake the entrance of the cove, and quite half of the little basin itself.|$|E

Renting a space {{on the top floor of}} the Hotel Oxford and Cambridge, Anna’s accommodation was connected to an adjoining room occupied by Lena. They were situated in the 1st arrondissement of Paris in close proximity to the Tuileries Garden and the Musée du Louvre, Surviving family correspondence, including illustrations, describes the experiences they had while they were there. These letters include descriptions of artists’ materials, subject matter in included in works of art, and comments about critiques received from their instructors.Under the training of Gustave Clarence Rodolphe Boulanger (French, 1824-1888) and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre (French, 1836-1912), Anna produced figurative charcoal drawings rather than paintings; both were revered artists. Lefebvre was known for his meticulously executed portraits and nudes, and during his long career, he earned three Salon medals, was appointed to the French Academy of Fine Arts, attained the rank of Commander in the Legion of Honor, and won the coveted Prix de Rome in 1861. Gustave Boulanger, also a figure painter, was best known for his classical and Orientalist subjects. Some of his other students included Childe Hassam (1859-1935), George Hitchcock (1850-1913), Frederick William MacMonnies (1863-1937), Gari Melchers (1860-1932), Willard Leroy Metcalf (1858-1925), Elizabeth Nourse (1860-1938), Robert Reid (1862-1929), and Edmund Charles Tarbell (1862-1938) - Anna's work was in good company. Likely her awareness of the reputations of her mentors resulted in <b>welcomed</b> <b>reception</b> of their instruction. In one letter, she wrote that she received [...] "stern criticisms" [...] and yet recounted that they were “fair and instructive.” ...|$|R

Elderly colonels, who had outlived the love of truth, wrote to the papers to say that they had been familiar with the works of Ghurab in Afghanistan, and Aden, and other suitable localities {{a quarter of a century}} ago. A Ghurab-of-Karmanshah Club sprang into existence, the members of which alluded to each other as Brother Ghurabians on the slightest provocation. And to the flood of inquiries, criticisms, and requests for information, which naturally poured in on the discoverer, or rather the discloser, of this long-hidden poet, the Rev. Wilfrid made one effectual reply: Military considerations forbade any disclosures which might throw unnecessary light on his nephew’s movements.|$|R
