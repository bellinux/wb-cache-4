Local NGOs reported that authorities sometimes moved prisoners without telling families, making the provision of food difficult or impossible.

25|$|Jamaica College {{was founded}} in 1789, making it the fourth oldest {{high school in the}} country. It was first known as the Drax Free School in the parish of St. Ann, and was founded by Charles Drax, a planter of that parish, who was {{originally}} from Twickenham, England. Drax came to Jamaica from Barbados in 1721 and, having died that same year, left money in his will to establish a charity school in St. Ann. There was some delay and legal proceedings before the money was handed over to the St. Ann vestry. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> probate the Drax will, and with the theft of some of the money, Jamaica College in its original form did not start until 1795. Then it was decided that Jamaica College would be a high school and an outpost of the University of London. It was in 1802 that the sum of £5,200 (JA$10,400 at the time), was applied by an Act of the Legislature to the endowment of the school.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} of the war {{commenced}} with a confident Kaurava army facing the Pandavas. Arjuna, realizing that something needed to be done quickly to reverse the Pandava losses, decided that he had to try to kill Bhishma. Krishna skillfully located Bhishma's chariot and steered Arjuna toward him. Arjuna tried to engage Bhishma in a duel, but the Kaurava soldiers placed around Bhishma to protect him attacked Arjuna to try to prevent him from directly engaging Bhishma. Arjuna and Bhishma fought a fierce battle that raged for hours. Drona and Dhrishtadyumna similarly engaged in a duel in which Drona defeated Dhrishtadyumna. Bhima intervened and rescued Dhrishtadyumna. Duryodhana sent the troops of Kalinga to attack Bhima and most of them, including the king of Kalinga, lost their lives at his hands. Bhishma immediately came to relieve the battered Kalinga forces. Satyaki, who was assisting Bhima, shot at Bhishma's charioteer and killed him. Bhishma's horses, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> control them, bolted carrying Bhishma away from the battlefield. The Kaurava army had suffered great losses {{at the end of the}} second day, and were considered defeated.|$|E
25|$|At {{what became}} the Constitutional Convention, Read again {{represented}} Delaware. Quoting from Wright & Morris in their Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution, Read immediately argued for a new national government under a new Constitution, saying 'to amend the Articles was simply putting old cloth on a new garment.' He was {{a leader in the}} fight for a strong central government, advocating, at one time, the abolition of the states altogether and the consolidation of the country under one powerful national government. 'Let no one fear the states, the people are with us;' he declared to a Convention shocked by this radical proposal. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> support his motion, he settled for protecting the rights of the small states against the infringements of their larger, more populous neighbors who, he feared, would 'probably combine to swallow up the smaller ones by addition, division or impoverishment.' He warned that Delaware 'would become at once a cipher in the union' if the principle of equal representation embodied in the New Jersey (small-state) Plan was not adopted and if the method of amendment in the Articles was not retained. He favored giving Congress the right to vote state laws, making the federal legislature immune to popular whims by having senators hold office for nine years or during good behavior, and granting the U.S. President broad appointive powers. Outspoken, he threatened to lead the Delaware delegation out of the Convention if the rights of the small states were not specifically guaranteed in the new Constitution. Once the rights were assured, he led the ratification movement in Delaware, which, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, became the first state to ratify and did so unanimously.|$|E

500|$|Chamorro's peace {{reforms are}} perhaps her most {{enduring}} legacy. Most noteworthy was her official {{declaration of the}} end of the war, as it was the pivot upon which all of her other policies depended. She maintained peace by a reduction in the size and power of the military, ending the national draft, and the demobilization of the military. The day she took office, she abolished military conscription and within a few weeks had reduced the size of the army by half. Demobilization included disbanding the US-backed Contras thereby leaving the Sandinistas <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> fight, and thus creating a highly effective peace. Chamorro also granted unconditional amnesties for political crimes, resulting in little room for protest from the Sandinistas, and enabling a smooth transition of power. One of the ways she accomplished the co-operation of the Contras was to openly seek help from local officials in collecting weapons from both sides of the conflict. She began a fierce weapon-buying campaign to help eradicate the threat of continuing violence; all the collected weapons were covered in concrete at the Plaza de la Paz (Peace Square), specifically built in downtown Managua to symbolize [...] "Never Again".|$|E

2500|$|A {{distinct}} use of {{the term}} sound from its use in physics is that in physiology and psychology, where the term refers to the subject of perception by the brain.

Webster's 1947 dictionary defined sound as: [...] "that which is heard; the effect which is produced by the vibration of a body affecting the ear."

Another study found that 12% of Americans have no one with whom to spend free time or to discuss important matters. Other research suggests that this rate has been increasing over time.

2500|$|The {{depression}} of abandonment grief creates a sustained type of stress that constitutes an emotional trauma {{which can be}} severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection. [...] A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that 'being left' triggers primal separation fear, {{also referred to as}} primal abandonment fear – the fear of being left <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> take care of one’s vital needs. [...] Our first anxiety is a response to separation from Mother. [...] This sensation is stored in the amygdala – a structure set deep into the brain’s emotional memory system responsible for conditioning the fight/freeze/flight response to fear. [...] Primal fear may have been initiated by birth trauma and even have some prenatal antecedents. The emotional memory system is fairly intact at or before birth and lays down traces of the sensations and feelings of the infant’s separation experiences. [...] These primitive feelings are reawakened by later events, especially those reminiscent of unwanted or abrupt separations from a source of sustenance.|$|E
