5|$|Croatia is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} Croats (89.6%), while minorities include Serbs (4.5%) and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each) recognised by the Constitution of Croatia.

After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced out or fled during the last part of and after World War II, and a similar fate was suffered by the Italian population. The late 19th century and the 20th century <b>were</b> <b>marked</b> by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia <b>were</b> <b>marked</b> by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by urbanisation.

5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs <b>were</b> <b>marked</b> for voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E
5|$|Ceolnoth (died 870) was {{a medieval}} English Archbishop of Canterbury. Although later chroniclers stated he had {{previously}} held ecclesiastical office in Canterbury, there is no contemporary evidence of this, and his first appearance in history is when he became archbishop in 833. Ceolnoth faced two problems as archbishop– raids and invasions by the Vikings and a new political situation resulting from a change in overlordship from one kingdom to another during {{the early part of}} his archiepiscopate. Ceolnoth attempted to solve both problems by coming to an agreement with his new overlords for protection in 838. Ceolnoth's later years in office <b>were</b> <b>marked</b> by more Viking raids and a decline in monastic life in his archbishopric.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{missions}} established Western {{educational institutions}} in the Protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country. Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access <b>were</b> <b>marked.</b> The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances between North and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst {{in other parts of}} Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.|$|E
