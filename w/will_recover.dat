5|$|While {{waiting at}} the {{hospital}} as Marcus is being treated, Grace breaks down and Mason becomes upset with her for refusing {{to talk to him}} about how she feels; instead, she tells him that she no longer wants to marry him and that she plans to have an abortion. Upset, she returns to Jayden's father's house and breaks in, intending to injure him while he sleeps, but she is interrupted by Jayden, who suggests that they smash his car instead. Grace opens up to Jayden about being sexually abused by her own father, and after Jayden shows Grace bruises from where her father hit her they return together to Short Term 12, where Jayden reports her father for physical abuse. Grace goes home to apologize to Mason, who tells her that Marcus <b>will</b> <b>recover.</b>|$|E
5|$|With treatment, {{symptoms}} {{should improve}} within 36hours. About 50% of people <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> without treatment {{within a few}} days or weeks. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.|$|E
5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> to face the Mysterons again.|$|E

25|$|The {{onset of}} bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence, between 13 and 20 years of age, and many cases have {{previously}} suffered from obesity, with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic bingeing and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission. A lifetime prevalence of 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent for adult and adolescent sufferers, respectively, is estimated among the United States population. Bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1% {{of young women}} and, after 10 years of diagnosis, half <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> fully, a third <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> partially, and 10–20% will still have symptoms.|$|E

25|$|After West Indies tour, Malinga {{suffered}} by back injury and a knee injury. With this, {{he did not}} participate to both New Zealand tour and India tour, hoping that he <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> when 2016 ICC World Twenty20 begins. However, Malinga was appointed as the captain for 2016 Asia Cup, where he was only able to play against UAE, with a match-winning bowling performance. The knee injury backed up him in the next matches and Sri Lanka lost all matches due to absence of Malinga in the team. Sri Lanka announced his World T20 team with Malinga as the captain, but continuous injuries results Malinga to stepped down from captaincy and Angelo Mathews has been named as the captain in all formats. Even though Sri Lanka felt that Malinga <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> for the World cup matches, his injury results him to ruled out of the Twenty20 squad. He returned home due to prevailing bone bruise on his left knee.|$|E

25|$|With early treatment, rapid {{recovery}} from the acute symptoms can be expected, {{and the risk of}} coronary artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (i.e. the patient <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> eventually), but the risk of coronary artery involvement is much greater. Overall, about 2% of patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis. Patients who have had Kawasaki disease should have an echocardiogram initially every few weeks, and then every one or two years to screen for progression of cardiac involvement.|$|E

25|$|It {{is planned}} to use nearly 14% of the {{reclaimed}} land for residential and commercial purposes. Total 52 buildings will be constructed including eight museums. For maximum usage of land, the floor space index (FSI) has been raised up to 5. The funds raised by selling the land <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> {{the cost of the}} construction and sustain the management of the riverfront. Two of the 42 plots will be sold in May 2017. All construction will have to follow certain design guidelines. Four of these 42 proposed buildings will be 101 metres tall.|$|E
25|$|Oil sands {{operations}} {{differ from}} conventional oil {{in that the}} initial profitability is somewhat lower, but the geological and political risks are low, the reserves are vast, and the expected lifetime of production extends for generations rather than just a few years. Governments {{have an incentive to}} subsidize the start-up costs since they <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> their initial subsidies from tax revenues {{over a long period of}} time. From the standpoint of federal-provincial revenues, they also differ in that the federal government will receive larger higher share and higher return on its incentives than it would from conventional oil, while the provincial share, although substantial, will be proportionally smaller. Consequently, there has tended to be much less intergovernmental conflict and more agreement on how these projects should be handled.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Donna (revealed to {{be another}} false name) converses with a fellow police officer, Mike, and the {{audience}} learns that New-Path {{is responsible for the}} manufacture and distribution of Substance D; ironically they use victims of the drug to tend their crops, since (being nearly mindless) they can be trusted not to reveal New-Path's secret. Donna expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work, in which they deliberately selected Arctor—without his knowledge—to become addicted to Substance D all along; his health was sacrificed so that he might eventually enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's Substance D farms. Donna and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> enough so that he grasps the situation and returns from serving his sentence with substantial evidence to shut down New-Path.|$|E

25|$|Bakker et al. (1997) {{suggests}} {{two options}} available for restoring salt marshes. The {{first is to}} abandon all human interference and leave the salt marsh to complete its natural development. These types of restoration projects are often unsuccessful as vegetation tends to struggle to revert to its original structure and the natural tidal cycles are shifted due to land changes. The second option suggested by Bakker et al. (1997) is to restore the destroyed habitat into its natural state either at the original site or as a replacement at a different site. Under natural conditions, recovery can take 2–10 years or even longer depending on the nature and degree of the disturbance and the relative maturity of the marsh involved. Marshes in their pioneer stages of development <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> more rapidly than mature marshes as they are often first to colonize the land. It is important to note, that restoration can often be sped up through the replanting of native vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game. The {{player can}} perform several actions, {{including}} jump, sprint, crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights. When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter their heads-up display (HUD), denoting {{that they have}} taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, then their health <b>will</b> <b>recover.</b> The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's current ammunition count. The game features traditional guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns {{at the beginning of}} each level, but may switch them out with another gun they find. Most guns have attachments, such as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors. The player can also use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat. In some levels, the player will be given special equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser designator.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{standard}} enemies {{from among the}} game's antagonistic force, the party can also battle Mira's indigenous wildlife. While some creatures are docile until attacked, others will attack if they hear or see you. Upon entering battle, each character attacks with their assigned automatically to a set rhythm based on their assigned weapons; each character has health points (HP) and Tension points (TP), and a morale gauge which determines their effectiveness in battle. Attack strength varies depending on a party member's position upon attacking. Healing the party in-battle {{can be done with}} types of Arts, but is mainly done using a quick-time event (QTE) tied to the Soul Voice system, a line-up of commands which trigger a Soul Challenge QTE, healing the party or granting positive effects. Successfully completing a Soul Challenge raises the party's morale. If a battle is successfully completed, knocked-out party members will revive and the party <b>will</b> <b>recover</b> HP. If the avatar is knocked out, they can either teleport to a safe location or wait and be revived if the other party members defeated all engaged enemies within thirty seconds.|$|E
