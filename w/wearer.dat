By using numerical algorithms, the <b>wear</b> volume measurements of <b>wear</b> profiles are to save considerable time and economical. A new mathematical method is issued for determining <b>wear</b> volumes in this study. The estimated results were precisely fitted as compared with other calculations for three dimensional estimations of <b>wear</b> volumes. <b>Wear</b> rate is a significant reference for considering the <b>wear</b> resistance of coatings.

5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the <b>wearer</b> unrestricted mobility.

5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture <b>wearer.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the <b>wearer.</b> Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E

5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted natural materials have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the <b>wearer,</b> were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings.

The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed {{the nature of the}} relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty and the integrity of the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable <b>wearer</b> of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E

5|$|Cincinnati {{already had}} a large anti-slavery {{movement}} who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents {{in the years before}} Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was very cautious about helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he could trust and the community learned that it could trust him. Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home's rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests coming and going, the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would be dressed as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman's attire; its high collar, long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its <b>wearer</b> when their head was tilted slightly downward.|$|E

5|$|Personal {{interaction}} with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, {{that were supposed to}} convey gods' answers to questions. Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive characteristics to the <b>wearer.</b> Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish personal goals, from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used heka, the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help.|$|E

The main objective was to quantitatively compare the <b>wear</b> behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of the real <b>worn</b> area in the <b>wear</b> scar, the change in the <b>wear</b> volume and the maximum <b>wear</b> depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of the <b>wear</b> tests showed that the <b>wear</b> volume and the maximum <b>wear</b> depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the <b>wear</b> scar, it is possible to separate the size of the <b>wear</b> scar from the real <b>worn</b> area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the <b>wear</b> volume has a linear relation with the real <b>worn</b> area rather than the size of the <b>wear</b> scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though the <b>wear</b> tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a <b>wear</b> resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the real <b>worn</b> area and the <b>wear</b> behavior at each spring shape...|$|R
