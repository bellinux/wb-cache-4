5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{extended}} philosophical essays addressing environmental ethics, John Passmore's Man's Responsibility for Nature has been criticised by defenders of deep ecology because of its anthropocentrism, often claimed to be constitutive of traditional Western moral thought. Indeed, defenders of anthropocentrism concerned with the ecological crisis contend that {{the maintenance of a}} healthy, sustainable environment is necessary for human well-being as opposed to for its own sake. The problem with a [...] "shallow" [...] viewpoint is not that it is human-centred but that according to William Grey: [...] "What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists.

As a leftover concept from the days of feudalism, Foucault argues that westerners still view power as emanating from law, but he rejects this, proclaiming that we must [...] "...construct an analytics of power that no longer takes law as a model and a code," [...] and announcing that a different form of power governs sexuality.
