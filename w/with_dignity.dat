5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1860s, Henschel's {{houses of}} Recife and Salvador were already making portraits of people of African origin, slaves and free, differing from other photographers by portraying them freely and <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> as people and not as objects.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E

5|$|By 1182 Young Henry reiterated his {{previous}} demands: {{he wanted to}} be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household <b>with</b> <b>dignity.</b> Henry refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate Young Henry. With trouble clearly brewing, Henry attempted to defuse the situation by insisting that Richard and Geoffrey give homage to Young Henry for their lands. Richard did not believe that Young Henry had any claim over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when Henry forced Richard to give homage, Young Henry angrily refused to accept it. Young Henry formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou. Open war broke out in 1183 and Henry and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they could conclude it, however, Young Henry caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered {{and it would have been}} impossible for them to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the garrison surrender, the garrison refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the garrison were able to give up the castle <b>with</b> <b>dignity.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, Harclay was arraigned {{before a}} royal justice in Carlisle, but was denied a proper hearing. He was brought forward apparelled in his robes of estate as a knight and earl. His spurs of knighthood were hewed off, and his sword was broken over his head. He was {{stripped}} of his robes, and proclaimed to be no knight, but a knave. He was then convicted as a traitor, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He behaved <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> at his execution, where he maintained that he had acted as he did {{out of concern for}} {{the best interest of the}} country. After his death, his head was taken to the king at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, before it was hung up on London Bridge. The four parts of his body were dispersed around the country, and displayed in Carlisle, Newcastle, Bristol, and Dover.|$|E

5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{international}} conventions on flying the flag, but protocol {{adopted by a}} large number of countries have such similarities as to suggest lines of commonly accepted practice. In general two areas of exposure are identified: national and international events. In both cases it is generally followed practice that national flags displayed in a group should be of equal size and each hoisted on its own flagstaff, of equal height, or on separate ropes if fixed on yardarm. The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset, except in case of bad weather; exhibition at night is permitted provided it is adequately illuminated. The flag is raised and lowered vividly and with solemnity; it is always treated <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> and should never be allowed to touch the ground or water. Vertical hoist is transformationally identical to horizontal hoist (i.e. the flag is rotated 90 degrees).|$|E
5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die <b>with</b> <b>dignity,</b> refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, Adler is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E

25|$|Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> National Center (DDNC) is a 501(c)3, nonpartisan, nonprofit {{organization}} headquartered in Portland, Oregon {{that has led}} the legal defense of and education about Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> laws throughout the US for 20 years. DDNC helped write and defend the nation’s first successful Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> law, in Oregon, protecting the right of persons with terminal illness {{to control their own}} deaths. The organization is affiliated with the Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> Political Fund, a distinct and separate 501(c)4 entity responsible for the political defense of Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> laws and the promotion of these initiatives in other states around the U.S.|$|E

In 2001 DDNC partnered with activists in Vermont to establish Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> Vermont, and in 2002 DDNC launched an effort in Hawaii to pass Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> legislation through the legislative process. In 2003 ODLDEC is renamed the Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> National Center (DDNC).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, DDNC {{partnered with}} Patient Choices Vermont to help pass Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> {{legislation}} through their legislature.

25|$|In 1993 Oregon Right to Die, a {{political}} action committee, was founded to draft and pass Oregon's Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> ballot measure 16. The following year the Oregon Right to Die PAC (ORDPAC) campaigned successfully for {{the passage of}} Measure 16 in Oregon; 51% of Oregon voters approved the Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> ballot initiative which created the Oregon Death <b>With</b> <b>Dignity</b> Law (DWD) allowing those who are terminally ill to hasten death in consultation with their physician and under strict safeguards, making Oregon the first U.S. state {{and one of the}} first jurisdictions in the world to officially do so. Subsequently, the Oregon Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> Legal Defense and Education Center (ODLDEC), the forerunner to the Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> National Center, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded to defend the voter-approved law. In 1997, Oregon Right to Die Political Action Committee successfully defeated Measure 51, an attempt to ban Death <b>with</b> <b>Dignity</b> in Oregon, by a margin of 60% to 40%.|$|E
