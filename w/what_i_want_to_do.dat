I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E

In August 2004 they {{traveled around the}} country to meet the shortlisted candidates. Smothers said that their main casting goal was diversity. Diverse representation was also important to T.J. Jourian, one of the four students cast for the show: [...] "What pushed me to do it was the idea of showing trans people of color, pushing beyond the American image of a gay white man." [...] "I didn’t want to be in anything where I was representing the whole community.… <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is just give another example of a way to be." ...|$|E

While working on Hannah Montana, she enrolled at Options for Youth Charter Schools and studied with a private tutor on set. Raised a Christian, she was baptized in a Southern Baptist church before moving to Hollywood in 2005. She attended church regularly while growing up and wore a purity ring. In 2001, when Cyrus was eight, she and her family moved to Toronto, Canada while her father filmed the television series Doc. After Billy Ray took her to see a 2001 Mirvish production of Mamma Mia! at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Cyrus grabbed his arm and told him, [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> daddy. I want to be an actress." [...] She began taking singing and acting classes at the Armstrong Acting Studio in Toronto.|$|E
500|$|On 1 November 2012, Novakovic {{confirmed}} {{that she would}} be leaving Neighbours to pursue acting opportunities in the United States. Of her decision to leave the serial, Novakovic stated [...] "Australia is small compared to what else is out there, especially in Los Angeles. I love acting and it's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so why not be in the thick of it all? I certainly love to do more Aussie things but, being realistic, there is nowhere near as much opportunity here." [...] During her first interview since announcing her departure, Novakovic explained that her main reasons for leaving Neighbours were to try other things and explore different characters. The actress said that she had wanted to do two years with the show, but when the time came, she decided to stay for another year to prepare herself to leave.|$|E
500|$|According to Burks, Hubbard [...] "was so {{sure he had}} {{something}} 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' {{and that they were}} to meet him at Penn Station, and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer." [...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position." [...] He went on: ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Chabon (pronounced, in his words, [...] "Shea as in Shea Stadium, Bon as in Bon Jovi", i.e., [...] ) {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a {{physician}} and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I can do this.' And I never had any second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny thing about it is that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E
500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is get a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to get through this fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for you.

A couple of years later I was at CBGB's doing my best Noddy Holder." [...] Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. We always had the feeling that they were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 Gauci formed Tune in Tokyo, an electro-pop {{and dance}} music band, with {{producer}} Paul Brandoli. As the group's lead singer, Gauci's look and sound had changed.

Gauci explained, [...] "That's where I {{came out of my}} shell. I didn't have anyone telling me what to do. Tune in Tokyo is just one part of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We got a lot of feedback straight away, which was great because it gave me confidence about the project". On 4 November 2010 they released their debut single, [...] "Dreamer", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Clubs Chart. It was co-written by Brandoli and Gauci.

[...] She said she was influenced by reading about the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University freshman, involving cyberbullying and joined Twitter to facilitate her efforts. In March 2015, Lewinsky continued to speak out publicly against cyberbullying, delivering a TED talk calling for a more compassionate Internet. In June 2015, she became an ambassador and strategic advisor for anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution. The same month, she gave an anti-cyberbullying speech at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In September 2015, Lewinsky was interviewed by Amy Robach on Good Morning America, about Bystander Revolution's Month of Action campaign for National Bullying Prevention Month.
