5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US41 was M-15, in use as far back as 1919. The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to follow the route that US41 follows today. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41. In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The original map showed US41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette. The new US41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E

At one time, she had them all in college at the same time—and Almena could afford that. When Robert Quigley King first started at Wittenberg, it held classes in the lecture room of the First Lutheran Church. However, while he was a student, Wittenberg moved to what is now the western part of its present-day campus. He was in the first class to graduate from Wittenberg.

500|$|During {{the time}} Hoffman held the career record for saves, many still {{considered}} Rivera the best closer of all time. Like many other relievers of his era, Hoffman {{was compared to}} Rivera and his success in the playoffs. While Hoffman had 601 regular-season saves, he only had four in the playoffs. Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman's retirement announcement, [...] "Not everybody can have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to protect 47 different times." [...] His last postseason save was in 2006, which was also his first postseason save in eight years. [...] Though the Padres were in the playoffs three other times in that span, they never took a single lead. Hoffman, however, did blow a save opportunity in his only World Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs. John Delcos of The Journal News, who covered the New York Yankees for eight years, believes the Yankees <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> as successful with Hoffman instead of Rivera. David Wells, who played with both Hoffman and Rivera, said, [...] " [...] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go to the postseason more than the Padres do, and he's had more opportunities there. The way they go about it, they're {{the best in the}} game. Trevor's the best in the West and [...] {{is the best in the}} East."
