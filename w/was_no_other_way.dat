Having found {{out the hard way}} that [...] "banter doesn't always work", she becomes quieter and [...] "not as mouthy". The {{character}} [...] "called the shots" [...] in her final appearance, and was the [...] "bigger person" [...] by forcing everyone to accept the reality of the situation. After years of hunting together, the relationship between Jo and Ellen also develops; Tal came to view them more as equals rather than daughter and mother. Although Jo's feelings for Dean remain the same, Tal liked the fact that she does not easily give in to Dean's advances in [...] "Abandon All Hope...". She believed that Jo resists her urge to [...] "go crazy [...] " [...] due to the dire circumstances, which [...] "gave it a little more meaning". When asked about the kiss that Dean gives to Jo when she is dying, Tal explained that she interpreted the kiss as Dean [...] "really seeing [...] and thanking [...] and appreciating [...] For him, at that particular moment, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> to express it but with a kiss." ...|$|E
500|$|The next month, Hunter {{participated in}} the third GOP debate, {{featured}} on CNN. During the forum, he discussed his experience {{as chairman of the}} Armed Services Committee and voiced his support for the War in Iraq and the training of Iraqi battalions for security there. Hunter speculated that Iran was helping to arm the insurgency in Iraq. When asked what he would do as president if he discovered Iran was developing a nuclear weapon, Hunter stated that he [...] "would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons [...] if there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> to preempt..." [...] After discussing foreign policy, Hunter {{turned his attention to the}} issue of immigration. He again mentioned the importance of a border wall and evoked the audience's memory about the fence he helped build in his congressional district, joking [...] "if they (illegal immigrants) get across my fence , we sign them up for the Olympics immediately." [...] At the end of the debate, Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners: John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney. He complained that Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts exerted too much influence on the three men, describing them as the [...] "Kennedy Wing of the Republican Party." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mellotron {{became a}} key {{instrument}} in progressive rock. King Crimson bought two Mellotrons when forming in 1969. They {{were aware of}} Pinder's contributions to the Moody Blues and didn't want to sound similar, but concluded there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> of generating the orchestral sound. The instrument was originally played by Ian McDonald, and subsequently by Robert Fripp on McDonald's departure. Later member David Cross recalled he didn't particularly {{want to play the}} Mellotron, but felt that it was simply what he needed to do {{as a member of the}} band. Tony Banks bought a Mellotron from Fripp in 1971, which he claimed was previously used by King Crimson, to use with Genesis. He decided to approach the instrument in a different way to a typical orchestra, using block chords, and later stated that he used it in the same manner as a synth pad on later albums. His unaccompanied introduction to [...] "Watcher of the Skies" [...] on the album Foxtrot (1972), played on a Mk II with combined strings and brass, became significant enough that Streetly Electronics provided a [...] "Watcher Mix" [...] sound with the M4000. Banks claims to still have a Mellotron in storage, but doesn't feel inclined to use it as he generally prefers to use up-to-date technology. Barclay James Harvest's Woolly Wolstenholme bought an M300 primarily to use for string sounds, and continued to play the instrument live into the 2000s as part of a reformed band.|$|E

Port installations, some industrial facilities, and transportation junctions were blown up (even the electric power plant, various mills, stores of bread, sugar, and other foods were destroyed). Of Odessaâ€™s population, scarcely 200,000 remained; many had {{hidden in the}} vicinity while some had sought safety in the countryside.
