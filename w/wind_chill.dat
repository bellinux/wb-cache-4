5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the <b>wind</b> <b>chill</b> is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
40|$|The {{successfully}} developed <b>wind</b> <b>chiller</b> in our CCT Lab. directly uses {{wind force}} to drive refrigeration system and hence reduces two times energy conversions between mechanical and electrical energies. The <b>wind</b> <b>chiller</b> needs high <b>wind</b> speed for its effective work {{due to the}} large working torque is required by the compressor. For the purpose of enlarging the applied wind field by the wind machine, this work aims to develop a dual system of <b>wind</b> <b>chiller</b> integrated with <b>wind</b> generator. The integrated wind generator can use the wind energy which cannot effectively drive the compressor. Therefore, the new developed dual system can apply larger range of the wind field and further increase the total working efficiency of the wind machine. A programmable logic controller (PLC) is applied in this wind forced dual system to select the <b>wind</b> <b>chiller</b> or the <b>wind</b> generator separately {{in terms of the}} rotational speed of the wind machine. In this work, the <b>wind</b> <b>chiller</b> is switched on while the accelerated rotational speed reaches 80 Â rpm and off while the decelerated rotational speed reaches 60 Â rpm. The integrated wind generator is switched on while the decelerated rotational speed reaches 60 Â rpm and off while the decelerated rotational speed reaches 40 Â rpm. The two apparatuses in the dual system always work separately. The results show that there is ca. 18. 5 % increment of effective working efficiency which is captured by the <b>wind</b> generator. <b>Wind</b> <b>chiller</b> <b>Wind</b> force Energy conversion Working efficiency Dual system...|$|R

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and <b>wind</b> <b>chill,</b> forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
5|$|Patagonia, in the south, {{is mostly}} arid or semi–arid {{except in the}} extreme west where {{abundant}} precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and annual temperature ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with general circulation patterns, generates {{one of the strongest}} precipitation gradients (rate of change in mean annual precipitation in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is more evenly distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (<b>wind</b> <b>chill),</b> while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation.|$|E
