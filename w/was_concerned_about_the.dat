5|$|In 1979, before {{construction}} {{had even}} begun, there was {{opposition to the}} construction of Trump Tower and other buildings in the area. The New York Committee for a Balanced Building Boom <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> planned rezoning of the area that would arise due {{to the construction of}} high-rise towers along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 57th Streets.|$|E
5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these nuclear tests, Reines <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dangers of {{radioactive}} pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Adams <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> new Constitution {{and made}} an attempt to {{re-enter}} national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth {{as a candidate for}} the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
40|$|Social {{scientists}} have always <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{role of religion}} for society. In the early twentieth century, there <b>were</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> compatibility of Catholicism and liberal democracy; in the post-Cold War period, there <b>were</b> <b>concerns</b> that international relations might be marked by a ‘Clash of Civilizations’; and today there <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> compatibility of Islam and ‘Western culture’. For economists, however, it {{is the relationship between}} religion and economic performance that <b>is</b> of prime <b>concern...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, {{at a cost of}} £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|E
5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh enjoyed {{looking after}} the Rossall estate (which had no steward or agent), but {{struggled}} to keep on top of finances; he was an indulgent landlord. He became an enthusiastic member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs because of increased mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually becoming {{more interested in the}} lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E

5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and he <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1861, Maeser left the Lyceum and was offered a {{position}} at the Union Academy, established by Brigham Young. This academy was intended for students above elementary grades. Young appointed Maeser head of the school in February 1861. Maeser <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> school systems meeting the needs and interests of its students, and he left the Union Academy to teach in other schools and seminaries, including the Twentieth Ward Seminary, which he founded in 1862. The school became a well-known training school for teachers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness, and a weight limit of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reliability of suspension bridges {{and did not want}} a potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{results of}} the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid {{to leave their homes}} to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E
5|$|The only {{television}} series Murphy starred in was the 1961 Whispering Smith {{in which he}} played the title character. Based on the film of the same name, the show was about a 19th-century Denver railroad investigator. Episodes were gleaned from real-life cases of the Denver Police Department. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> violent content in the show and leveled charges against the network. 26 episodes had been filmed, {{but not all of}} them aired.|$|E
5|$|Vasey <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{security}} of the Kaiapit area, as {{he believed that the}} Japanese were inclined to continue with a plan once it was in motion. Taking advantage of good flying weather on 22 September, 99 round trips were made between Nadzab and Kaiapit. Most of the 2/16th Infantry Battalion and some American engineers were flown in. The 2/14th Infantry Battalion and a battery of the 2/4th Field Regiment arrived on 25 September, and Brigadier Kenneth Eather's 25th Infantry Brigade began to arrive two days later, freeing Dougherty to advance on Dumpu.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though he <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and {{an extension of the}} franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Ripley's {{introduction}} in Aliens was {{not included}} in the theatrical version of the film, since 20th Century Fox <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film's running time. Sigourney Weaver criticized the cut, seeing Amanda as crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development and her bond with the orphaned Newt. While developing Alien: Isolation, Creative Assembly originally desired a female protagonist and decided to use Amanda as the best way to focus on her mother, Ellen's, traits. The picture model for Ripley in Aliens is Elizabeth Inglis, Sigourney Weaver's mother, and in Alien: Isolation she is voiced by Andrea Deck with motion capture by Kezia Burrows. Amanda's design in Alien: Isolation was based on pictures from Elizabeth Inglis' youth.|$|E

5|$|Conwell {{was born}} about 1748 in Moneymore, County Londonderry, Ireland (present-day Northern Ireland), {{the son of}} Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell. He studied at the Irish College in Paris and was ordained to the priesthood there in November 1776. Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a {{reputation}} as a preacher of only modest ability. Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there. He was appointed parish priest of Dungannon in 1792 or 1793 and Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Armagh in 1794. After the death of Archbishop Richard O'Reilly in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{was taken}} on {{as a member}} of the BBC Wales children's {{department}} in 1985 and given one-day contracts and commissions, such as illustrating for Why Don't You? As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance and volunteer for the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football-themed daily strip; he declined because he <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Vulović as {{the world}} record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in 1990 after taking part in anti-government protests, but avoided arrest because the government <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued {{her work as a}} pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia, advocating Serbia's entry into the European Union. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she continued to struggle with survivor's guilt. Having divorced, she lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.|$|E
