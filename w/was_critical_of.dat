5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool manager Bill Shankly {{was delighted}} with his team's victory and hailed {{it as his}} {{greatest}} moment in management. His Leeds counterpart, Don Revie, conceded Liverpool had been the better team, but was determined to make amends the following season. The national media <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the final, labelling it 'boring'.|$|E
5|$|Madhvacharya <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> {{the teachings}} of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not an illusion. His Dvaita Vedanta gained popularity, {{enabling}} him to establish eight mathas in Udupi. Ramanuja, head of the Vaishnava monastery in Srirangam, preached the way of devotion (bhakti marga) and wrote Sribhashya, a critique on Adi Shankara's Advaita.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is often}} {{identified}} as a Straussian and <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> theories that identify Leo Strauss with neoconservatism and the War in Iraq. He supports the Democratic Party, but <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> its left wing.|$|R
5000|$|Bock had <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> {{both parties}} {{for their support}} of an {{aggressive}} foreign policy. He had also <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> imperialism and nation-building, and believed that [...] "the U.S. empire {{is in the process}} of winding down." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Bawer edited a {{collection}} of writings by mostly gay men and women titled Beyond Queer: Challenging Gay Left Orthodoxy. The authors--including Sullivan, Jonathan Rauch, Stephen H. Miller, Paul Varnell, and Norah Vincent--covered {{a wide range of}} topics and did not have one political message. Some authors <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> how the gay rights movement was trying to achieve its goals, some <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> certain goals such as hate crime laws, and others <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> both the ends and the means.|$|R
5|$|On March 31, 1995, Specter {{announced}} his candidacy for President of the United States, {{to challenge the}} incumbent Bill Clinton. He entered the race as an alternate to the stereotypical religious conservative image. He <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, and Ralph Reed, saying all three were far too conservative.|$|E
5|$|The band <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> punk {{subculture}} {{and youth}} culture in general. Crass promoted an anarchism which became {{more common in}} the punk-music scene. They are considered art punk in their use of tape collages, graphics, spoken word releases, poetry and improvisation.|$|E
5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; {{the film was}} remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E

50|$|Most {{international}} relations theory that <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> realism in {{international relations}} <b>is</b> likewise <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> geostrategy because of the assumptions it makes about {{the hierarchy of the}} international system based on power.|$|R
5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Chongqing was {{reeling from}} {{problems}} such as air and water pollution, unemployment, poor public health, and complications from the Three Gorges Dam. According to analysts, Hu wanted to transfer his ally Wang Yang out of Chongqing before these problems intensified. Bo was initially reluctant to go to Chongqing and was reportedly unhappy with his new assignment. He had hoped to become vice-premier instead, but Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-premier Wu Yi argued against Bo's promotion to vice-premiership. In particular, Wu <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Bo's penchant for self-promotion, and Wen cited international lawsuits against Bo by Falun Gong adherents {{as a barrier to}} his holding higher office.|$|E

5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts {{did have}} some success. In April 1783, he sent {{an account of the}} {{massacre}} to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the slave trade. The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the election, Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate and was re-elected twice. He became an influential member of the party's conservative wing, serving {{as chairman of the}} Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Armed Services. He supported the presidential candidacy and eventual presidency of Richard Nixon; however, he <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Nixon's attempt to control prices and wages. Initially, Goldwater defended Nixon in light of the Watergate scandal until August 5, 1974, when he withdrew his support. Nixon resigned from office four days later.|$|E

5|$|In 1832, {{the canal}} company asked the {{engineer}} James Green to advise on further extensions to the system. His first report <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> {{much of the}} work completed by Pinkerton, and recommended completing the link from the Ashburnham Canal to the new Pembrey harbour. This would require a lock at Ty Mawr, with water supplied by the Dyvatty brook and a new reservoir to be constructed at Cwm Capel in the Dyvatty valley. A second report, supplied three months later, recommended an extension along the Gwendraeth valley, and the construction of three inclined planes to reach a terminus just above Cwmmawr. Water supply for the upper sections would be from a new reservoir to be built above Cwm y Glo.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Morrissey and Mark Billingham {{launched}} the production company Sleepyhead, which produced the Thorne television series. The company {{was a part}} of Stagereel, a production house previously set up by Morrissey's brother Paul. The company bought the rights to adapt the Thorne novels and Morrissey was already developing it to pitch to television channels when Sky made an offer to broadcast it. As of 2010, Morrissey and Tubedale Films were developing two feature films with financing from the UK Film Council. Morrissey <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the Coalition government's decision to close the UK Film Council, as he believed it was an asset to first-time filmmakers. The organisation's funding role was taken over by the British Film Institute in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In an {{incident}} {{for which he}} would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given {{to a group of}} Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E

50|$|Winter <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Western {{foreign policy}} for fueling anger and resentment in the Muslim world. He <b>is</b> equally <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi ideology, which he {{believes}} gives extremists a theological pretext for their extremism and violence.|$|R
5|$|Japanese {{losses were}} modest. The British {{assessed}} that two Japanese aircraft {{had been destroyed}} and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk. Damage was also {{believed to have been}} inflicted on the airfields, floating dry dock, oil tanks, other harbour installations and ships that were attacked. Following the operation, Brind assessed that rockets had proven more useful than bombs, and <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the gunnery of all the cruisers other than Newfoundland. Members of the Japanese garrison told US Strategic Bombing Survey investigators after the war that the British raid had resulted in practically no damage. The most significant loss was the destruction of part of the garrison's records, which led to a decision to bury the remaining files.|$|E
5|$|John Boscawen of the Act Party {{commented that}} the NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without {{precedent}} in any other nation in the world. Boscawen <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> {{the effect that the}} ETS will have on households and farmers, stating that the average power bill will rise 10%, fuel bills will rise by 7 cents per litre and dairy farms will face an increase in costs before agriculture enters the scheme of NZ$7,500 per year as a result of associated increases in fuel, electricity and the cost of processing milk products. Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Kirwan's {{contacts}} with Nassif {{later became the}} subject of a legal investigation. Kirwan not only shared inside information with Nassif about leasing plans of the GSA, he later invested in Nassif's D.C. business and became an officer in it. This relationship (Kirwan left GSA in December 1966, before the letter indicating intention to lease was set to Nassif), and GSA's irregular leasing of the building, became public knowledge in August 1970. An internal GSA audit <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the leasing process and the costs of the lease.|$|E
