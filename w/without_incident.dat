5|$|Ceres, the {{asteroid}} belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters {{of less than}} 600km. The remaining bodies range down {{to the size of}} a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it <b>without</b> <b>incident.</b> Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within {{the asteroid}} belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} Oryol (Eagle) on 7 November 1899 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. The ship was laid down on 1 June 1900 and {{launched}} on 19 July 1902, {{in the presence}} of the Emperor.

5|$|Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, {{and many}} {{organoboron}} compounds are relatively nontoxic to {{humans and animals}} (with toxicity {{similar to that of}} table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4g/day of boric acid was reported <b>without</b> <b>incident,</b> but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.|$|E
