25|$|In 1710, {{a plague}} killed about 20,000 (36 percent) of the population. After {{the end of}} the Great Northern War the city stagnated. Population growth halted and {{economic}} growth slowed. The city <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> after having lost its place as the capital of a Great power. However Stockholm maintained its role as the political centre of Sweden and continued to develop culturally under Gustav III.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock.</b> Time passed {{with no sign}} of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith {{suggested}} that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.|$|E
25|$|Daniel and Dulcie {{were married}} on 23 February 1878, and Stella {{was born in}} 1880, {{followed}} in 1882 by her younger sister Alice Lemira Sylvia Browne, known as Sylvia. When Stella was three years old, Daniel, now Superintendent of Lighthouses, was aboard the Dominion steamship Princess Louise, and drowned. Though the family <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> after his death, they were {{supported in part by}} money and property from his will, contingent on Dulcie remaining unmarried. Dulcie remained unmarried, sold the home and began a boarding house for single women. This boarding house meant that Stella was brought up in an environment surrounded by the struggles of single women throughout her childhood, and watched the struggle of her own mother, now a single working-woman.|$|E

25|$|On 13 May, {{they sat}} in the square, writing postcards waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed through an adoring and excited crowd of supporters, Ağca fired four shots at 17:17 with a 9mm Browning Hi-Power {{semi-automatic}} pistol, and critically wounded him. He fled the scene as the crowd <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> and disposed of the pistol by throwing it under a truck, but was grabbed by Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin, a nun, and several spectators who prevented him from firing more shots or escaping, and he was arrested. All four bullets hit John Paul II; two of them lodged in his lower intestine while the other two hit his left index finger and right arm and also injured two bystanders: Ann Odre, of Buffalo, New York, was struck in the chest, and Rose Hall was slightly wounded in the arm. The Pope was immediately rushed to the hospital while the authorities combed the site for evidence. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire.|$|E
500|$|After the game, Gary Anderson was {{described}} as [...] "inconsolable." [...] Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team. ESPN contributor Ben Goessling noted [...] "how swiftly it pulled the bottom {{out from under a}} team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point." [...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played the rest of the game as if it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time." [...] Randle concurred, describing his reaction to the kick as, [...] "I was standing there like someone just punched me in my stomach, and was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The team, led by Joseph Giordano, cut off Reagan's [...] "thousand dollar" [...] {{custom-made}} suit {{to examine}} him, much to Reagan's anger. Military officers, {{including the one}} who carried the nuclear football, unsuccessfully tried to prevent FBI agents from confiscating the suit, Reagan's wallet, and other possessions as evidence; the Gold Codes card was in the wallet, and the FBI did not return it until two days later. The medical personnel found that Reagan's systolic blood pressure was 60 versus the normal 140, indicating that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock,</b> and knew that most 70-year-olds in the president's condition would not survive. Reagan was in excellent physical health, however, and also was shot by the [...]22 caliber instead of the larger [...]38 as was first feared. They treated him with intravenous fluids, oxygen, tetanus toxoid, and chest tubes, and surprised Parr—who still believed that he had cracked the president's rib—by finding the entrance gunshot wound. Brady and the wounded agent McCarthy were operated on near the president; when his wife arrived in the emergency room, Reagan remarked to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing boxer Jack Dempsey's line to his wife the night he was beaten by Gene Tunney. While intubated, he scribbled to a nurse, [...] "All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia", borrowing W. C. Fields' line. Although Reagan came close to death, the team's quick action—and Parr's decision {{to drive to the}} hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life, and within 30 minutes Reagan left the emergency room for surgery with normal blood pressure.|$|E

After determining that the reading was correct, the nurse believed Joan <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> and placed a call to Dr. Walter Bertinot, who was named as his wife's attending physician by John Hill. [...] Bertinot, who knew Joan only socially, had no reason to believe she was seriously ill until the call from the hospital nurse. [...] Hill had described his wife's symptoms as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; Bertinot initially thought she was suffering from influenza. When Bertinot arrived in Joan's hospital room, she recognized him and made reference to a party which they had both attended. [...] Bertinot ordered IV fluids, took another history, and now believed she had a case of foodborne illness.|$|E

According to Jackson, [...] "When he hit me, the first time I <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock,</b> I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard." [...] Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, [...] "I think this guy who is with her has brainwashed her and made her like this...

2500|$|In 1998 Lionel {{was shocked}} to {{discover}} he had fathered a son, 16-year-old Luke Billingham (Greg Freeman) when he himself was 16.

Though Lionel <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock,</b> he took Luke in, Leigh stated, [...] "Lionel’s struggling {{to get through it}} as fatherhood is thrust upon him. He just inherited a 16-year-old son unlike most people who get to watch their kids from a baby and slowly get used to them." [...] The storyline proved to be hugely topical, with the amount of single parent families in the nineties was at an all-time high. Luke instantly got into trouble in his new home, he was involved in a robbery at Lionel's bar, drove Lionel's car without a driver's license and stole a credit card to access online pornography. Despite this, Leigh insisted Lionel was the best possible father, [...] "Lionel’s the best father. He talks through the troubles." [...] After initially struggling to connect with Luke, when he was involved in a dramatic bus crash Lionel realised how much he loved his son and even went to the extent of cooking him gourmet school lunches. After only knowing each other a year, the father-son partnership was broken after Lionel died in scenes that Freeman described as, [...] "draining". Luke soon became a father with his teenage bride, Josie Bergman (Karamia Muller) at age 16, similarly to his father Lionel.|$|E
