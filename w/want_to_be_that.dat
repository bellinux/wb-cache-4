500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
