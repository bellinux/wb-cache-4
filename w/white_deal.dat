6000|$|For the present, most {{of these}} visionaries are {{occupied}} with electricity. They intend to make the lightning a domestic slave in every house, and to turn Ariel into a common carrier. But, from the aspect of Winter's den in Paterson's Rents, {{it was easy to}} read that his heart was set on a more ancient foible. The <b>white</b> <b>deal</b> book-shelves, home-made, which lined every wall, were packed with tattered books on mechanics, and especially on the art of flying. Here you saw the spoils of the fourpenny box of cheap bookvendors mixed with volumes in better condition, purchased at a larger cost. Here--among the litter of tattered pamphlets and well-thumbed [...] "Proceedings" [...] of the Linnean and the Aeronautic Society of Great Britain--here were Fredericus Hermannus' [...] "De Arte Volandi," [...] and Cayley's works, and Hatton Turner's [...] "Astra Castra," [...] and the [...] "Voyage to the Moon" [...] of Cyrano de Bergerac, and Bishop Wilkins's [...] "Dædalus," [...] and the same sanguine prelate's [...] "Mercury, The Secret Messenger." [...] Here were Cardan and Raymond Lully, and a shabby set of the classics, mostly in French translations, and a score of lucubrations by French and other inventors--Ponton d'Amocourt, Borelli, Chabrier, Girard, and Marey.|$|E
60|$|Entering {{the gate}} and passing the shrubs, the {{silhouette}} of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a <b>white</b> <b>deal</b> table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.|$|E

6000|$|Through {{good and}} evil report in the varying fortune of that {{struggle}} which Don Jose had characterized in the phrase, [...] "the fate of national honesty trembles in the balance," [...] the Gould Concession, [...] "Imperium in Imperio," [...] had gone on working; the square mountain had gone on pouring its treasure down the wooden shoots to the unresting batteries of stamps; the lights of San Tome had twinkled night after night upon the great, limitless shadow of the Campo; every three months the silver escort had gone down to the sea as if neither the war nor its consequences could ever affect the ancient Occidental State secluded beyond its high barrier of the Cordillera. All the fighting {{took place on the}} other side of that mighty wall of serrated peaks lorded over by the white dome of Higuerota and as yet unbreached by the railway, of which only the first part, the easy Campo part from Sulaco to the Ivie Valley at the foot of the pass, had been laid. Neither did the telegraph line cross the mountains yet; its poles, like slender beacons on the plain, penetrated into the forest fringe of the foot-hills cut by the deep avenue of the track; and its wire ended abruptly in the construction camp at a <b>white</b> <b>deal</b> table supporting a Morse apparatus, in a long hut of planks with a corrugated iron roof overshadowed by gigantic cedar trees--the quarters of the engineer in charge of the advance section.|$|E
60|$|The book Adam {{most often}} read on a Sunday morning was his large pictured Bible, {{and this morning}} it lay open before him on the round <b>white</b> <b>deal</b> table in the kitchen; for he sat there {{in spite of the}} fire, because he knew his mother liked to have him with her, and it was the only day in the week when he could indulge her in that way. You would have liked to see Adam reading his Bible. He never opened it on a weekday, and so he came to it as a holiday book, serving him for history, biography, and poetry. He held one hand thrust between his {{waistcoat}} buttons, and the other ready to turn the pages, {{and in the course of}} the morning you would have seen many changes in his face. Sometimes his lips moved in semi-articulation--it was when he came to a speech that he could fancy himself uttering, such as Samuel's dying speech to the people; then his eyebrows would be raised, and the corners of his mouth would quiver a little with sad sympathy--something, perhaps old Isaac's meeting with his son, touched him closely; at other times, over the New Testament, a very solemn look would come upon his face, and he would every now and then shake his head in serious assent, or just lift up his hand and let it fall again. And on some mornings, when he read in the Apocrypha, of which he was very fond, the son of Sirach's keen-edged words would bring a delighted smile, though he also enjoyed the freedom of occasionally differing from an Apocryphal writer. For Adam knew the Articles quite well, as became a good churchman.|$|E
50|$|The Vittoria was {{designed}} and built between 1941 and 1942 by Armando Pagliani and two employees of the Luigi Teichfuss glider works at Pavullo nel Frignano Airport. It was a high-wing monoplane, with its single spar wing supported centrally on a fuselage pedestal and braced on each side from the spar at about one third span to the lower fuselage with a single steel faired strut. <b>White</b> <b>deal</b> ribs defined the wing section, which tapered from Göttingen 535 to the reflexed NACA M6 outboard. In plan the wing had a rectangular centre section and straight-tapered outer panels which ended in rounded tips.

40|$|The {{following}} {{notes were}} {{read on the}} proposed planting of coniferae in Tasmania : By Baron Ferd. Von Mueller, F. R. S., K. C. M. G. :—" With much pleasure, dear Mr. Morton, I respond to {{the request of the}} Royal Society of Tasmania, as moved by your distinguished Fellow, Mr. R. M. Johnston, and supported by the Hon. N. J Brown, that I should, along with our able friend. Mr. Abbott, give my opinion on the advisability of growing the Pinus silvestris on a commercial and industrial scale in Tasmania. Your island is undoubtedly particularly well fitted on account of its generally cool climate for the rearing of this pine, as compared to most other regions of Australia. Moreover, in your lowlands the growth will be of more celerity than in Britain, and the same remark applies, of course, to the larch and other trees mentioned at the Royal Society's last meeting. But, as besides the red deal, also the timber of the European <b>white</b> <b>deal</b> (from Pinus pirla) is much imported here, that species, as well as the leading lumber pines of North America, would deserve attention for forestral purposes in Tasmania also, thus particularly Pinus strobus, P. douglasii, P. lambertiana; nor should the vast timber pines of the Himalayas be lost sight of, such for instance as the Pinus deodara and P. excelsa. Several other species of prominent timber value are mentioned in my work on ' Select plants for industrial culture and naturalisation, with notes as to their respective properties. ...|$|E
