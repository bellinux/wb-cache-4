Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as the Appalachian waxy cap, is a gilled fungus of the waxcap family. It is found in the eastern United States, where it fruits singly, in groups, or clusters on the ground in deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E

5|$|Congregation Sons of Israel, {{self-described}} as egalitarian Conservative, was {{the first}} synagogue in Briarcliff Manor. The congregation was formed in 1891 by eleven men in Ossining, and until 1902 services were held in homes and stores. That year, the congregation (now twenty-three families) purchased a building on Durston Avenue; the Jewish Cemetery, established in 1900 on Dale Avenue, is still in use. In 1920, the synagogue, numbering forty-five families, established a religious school. After outgrowing its facilities, it purchased a site on Waller Avenue and completed a new synagogue in 1922. During the 1950s the congregation purchased the eleven-acre Mead Farm on Pleasantville Road, <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> used since 1960.|$|E

5|$|From 1902 to 1929 Real won the Copa del Rey {{five times}} and the {{regional}} championship 15 times. Real Madrid had a successful start in La Liga, finishing second in the competition's first season, and winning the league in 1932 for the first time. In the 1947–48 season, Real Madrid finished eleventh, which remains, as of 2014, the club's lowest finishing position. Real Madrid won La Liga four {{times and the}} European Cup five times during the 1950s. However, the most successful period for the club in terms of domestic titles was the 1960s, when Real Madrid won eight league championships.

5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius is {{very common}} and is found in {{broad-leaved}} woodland, favouring beech; it is most associated with Fagus sylvatica, the European Beech, though {{it has also been}} observed growing in association with species of oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal association with trees, and can grow {{on a wide variety of}} subsoil types, but is more typical of acidic soil. It is found between late summer and late autumn, and is native to Europe. The distribution of the mushroom coincides with the distribution of beech. In the British Isles, the species is one of the one hundred most common mushrooms. Other areas in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been recorded include Sweden, France, Italy, and Poland.|$|E

According to the company, its business plan is to sell vehicles for $1 billion each, for <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> forecast a market for at least 30 Skylons, while recurring costs of just $10 million per flight are predicted to be incurred by operators. While the REL intends to manufacture some components directly, such as the engine precooler, other components have been designed by partner companies and a consortium of various aerospace firms is expected to handle full production of Skylon.|$|E

The Labour Party has been represented on the board since 1919, when Halvdan Koht became a member. The Agrarian Party (since named the Centre Party) was first represented on the board by Birger Braadland in 1938. The Christian Democratic Party was first represented by Erling Wikborg in 1965, the Socialist Left Party by Hanna Kvanmo in 1991 and the Progress Party by Inger-Marie Ytterhorn in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Handball Federation {{announced}} in May 2013 that the arena {{would be used}} for a four-nation men's handball tournament, Bring Cup, in November. The federation stated that they would use the tournament to evaluate if the venue was suitable as a new national arena for handball. The venue received mixed reviews. The tournament saw low attendance and Danish commentator Bent Nyegaard criticized the arena for being too large. The federation was happy with the arena, and stated that were planning on using it for finals in their bid for future World and European Handball Championships. Telenor Arena is part of the Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been proposed used for short track speed skating and figure skating.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) started {{construction}} in 1899 {{and the first}} part of the line, from Hell to Stjørdalshalsen, opened on 1 February 1902. The railway opened to Levanger on 29 October 1902, to Verdalsøra on 1 November 1904 and to Sunnan on 15 November 1905. Sunnan was chosen as terminus because of its location on the southern end of the lake of Snåsavatnet. The line was further extended to Snåsa in 1926, after <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway is the most heavily trafficked non-electrified line in Norway, with the Trøndelag Commuter Rail running south of Steinkjer. It is also used by intercity passenger and freight trains.|$|E
5|$|The Ujung Kulon {{peninsula}} of Java {{was devastated}} by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. The Javan rhinoceros recolonized the peninsula after the event, but humans never returned in large numbers, thus creating a haven for wildlife. In 1931, as the Javan rhinoceros {{was on the brink}} of extinction in Sumatra, the government of the Dutch East Indies declared the rhino a legally protected species, <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> remained ever since. A census of the rhinos in Ujung Kulon was first conducted in 1967; only 25 animals were recorded. By 1980, that population had doubled, and has remained steady, at about 50, ever since. Although the rhinos in Ujung Kulon have no natural predators, they have to compete for scarce resources with wild cattle, which may keep their numbers below the peninsula's carrying capacity. Ujung Kulon is managed by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry. Evidence of at least four baby rhinos was discovered in 2006, the most ever documented for the species.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of}} a hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E
