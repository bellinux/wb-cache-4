25|$|Formerly {{owned by}} the abbey at Cluny, Auxey was once the site of many watermills powered by the river Clous. It is another of those appellations that is less well known, as its wines used to be sold as Volnay or Pommard.

500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, {{as he spoke}} in a sincere tone, his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us and tell us that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In the East, the {{persecution}} was officially discontinued on April 30, 311, although martyrdoms in Gaza continued until May 4. Galerius, now on his deathbed, issued a proclamation to end hostilities, and give Christians {{the rights to}} exist freely under the law, and to peaceable assembly. Persecution was everywhere at an end. Lactantius preserves the Latin text of this pronouncement, describing it as an edict. Eusebius provides a Greek translation of the pronouncement. His version includes imperial titles and an address to provincials, suggesting that the proclamation is, in fact, an imperial letter. The document seems only to have been promulgated in Galerius's provinces.Among all the other arrangements that we are always making for the benefit and utility of the state, we have heretofore wished to repair all things {{in accordance with the}} laws and public discipline of the Romans, and to ensure that even the Christians, who abandoned the practice of their ancestors, should return to good sense. Indeed, for some reason or other, such self-indulgence assailed and idiocy possessed those Christians, that they did not follow the practices of the ancients, which their own ancestors had, perhaps, instituted, but according to their own will and as it pleased them, they made laws for themselves that they observed, and gathered various peoples in diverse areas. Then when our order was issued stating that they should return themselves to the practices of the ancients, many were subjected to peril, and many were even killed. Many more persevered in their way of life, and we saw that they neither offered proper worship and cult to the gods, or to the god of the Christians. Considering the observation of our own mild clemency and eternal custom, by which we are accustomed to grant clemency to all people, we have decided to extend our most speedy indulgence to these people as well, so that Christians may once more establish their own meeting places, so long as they do not act in a disorderly way. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> send another letter to our officials detailing the conditions they ought to observe. Consequently, in accord with our indulgence, they ought to pray to their god for our health and the safety of the state, so that the state may be kept safe on all sides, and {{they may be able to}} live safely and securely in their own homes. Galerius's words reinforce the Tetrarchy's theological basis for {{the persecution}}; the acts did nothing more than attempt to enforce traditional civic and religious practices, even if the edicts themselves were thoroughly nontraditional. Galerius does nothing to violate the spirit of the persecutionChristians are still admonished for their nonconformity and foolish practicesGalerius never admits that he did anything wrong. The admission that the Christians' god might exist is made only grudgingly. Certain early 20th-century historians have declared that Galerius's edict definitively nullified the old [...] "legal formula" [...] non licet esse Christianos, made Christianity a religio licita, [...] "on a par with Judaism", and secured Christians' property, among other things.|$|E

[...] Regarding the quality of Trump-Putin interactions, McDowall wrote, that the documentary [...] "examines the relationship and asks if it is better for all if the two are buddies.

[...] Times Union contributor Lawrence White wrote, [...] "John Sweeney investigates the Trump-Putin connection and what it may mean for the world's collective well being."

2500|$|The band {{announced}} in late 2010 that more information of the album's actual content {{would be released}} in late January, but on February 1, the official website bore a statement written by Holopainen {{that because of the}} schedule changes he can't yet give away as much details as he would have wanted, but more information will be out after a couple of months. He added, however, that [...] "it still is the Burton-Gaiman-Dalí - amusement park <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> enter"; In the same statement it was revealed that the album will be a theme album and [...] "mood changes seem to be more present than ever before", and the orchestration demos he had received from Pip Williams were described as [...] "beautiful, twisted, tribal and cinematic stuff". In the Finnish version of the statement, it was also revealed that a few songs will not get any orchestrations at all, differing from their latest album on which all songs had the background orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|He later {{went to the}} Casa Rosada and {{received}} the presidential sash in the White Hall from Senate President Federico Pinedo, accompanied by Vice President Gabriela Michetti, Chamber of Deputies President Emilio Monzó and Supreme Court President Ricardo Lorenzetti.

2500|$|Trinity {{is one of}} the few {{colleges that}} {{continues}} the tradition of Formal Hall during the academic year; High Table dinners are usually held after Evensong on Wednesdays. Before the meal, one of the Student Heads or another positioned member of college (in order of precedence determined by seniority) is responsible for saying the Latin grace: Quae hodie sumpturi sumus, benedicat Deus, per Iesum Christum Dominum Nostrum. Amen. (May God bless what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> receive this day, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.) Formal Hall is marked by the enforcement of a number of regulations known as “Strachan Hall Etiquette”. The most evident of these is the dress code, of which Trinity’s distinctive academic gowns are the essential element for all members of college. In addition to the wearing of the gown, men are required to wear a jacket, collared shirt, long pants and a tie, as well as close-toed shoes. If a man of college has had the honour of being [...] "poored out", he is then permitted to wear his tie tied on the remains of his gown. For women of college, the dress code consists of a similar prohibition on open-toed shoes as well as a prohibition on short skirts and track pants. Although the dress code may look like an unnecessary burden to the casual observer, many students feel that it and other formalities lend a special atmosphere to the dinners that is not found in the rest of the university.|$|E
