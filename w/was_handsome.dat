5|$|The first botanical {{collection}} {{of this species}} {{may well have been}} Claude Riche, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's 1791 expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. During a visit to Esperance Bay, Riche explored an area in which B.speciosa is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections. The species was eventually collected by Robert Brown in 1802, and published by him in 1810. Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at Lucky Bay to be the lectotype in 1981. An early common name <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> banksia. Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves.|$|E
5|$|With Graham {{gone and}} the quarterback {{situation}} in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown's first losing season as a professional coach. In the next year's draft, the team selected Jim Brown out of Syracuse University. As television began to help football leapfrog baseball as America's most popular sport, Jim Brown became a larger-than-life personality. He <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> and charismatic in private and dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown's game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown's first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not contend for the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown's former protege Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the pieces}} that the duchess {{actually}} ordered I thought were hideous. Those wouldn’t work for the movie, so we modified and invented. Wallis wasn’t pretty; she <b>was</b> <b>handsome,</b> at best. In England, it was noted over and over how unattractive she was. But Wallis {{was a lot of}} fun—very entertaining. She had a freedom to her that was definitely reflected in her clothes; the duchess was all about presentation. And that became her refuge, and her prison.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{conservative}} in nature, especially {{when compared to}} the contemporary Nelson-class battleships built to satisfy the same treaty. The long (630 feet overall) hull was flush decked and with a high freeboard, and was strongly built. This afforded high initial stability, which contributed to the protection scheme. The machinery spaces followed the traditional layout of boiler rooms ahead of engine rooms, separated by an amidships magazine. The two boiler rooms exhausted into four uptakes, the central pair being combined to form a thickened central funnel. The three-funnel design <b>was</b> <b>handsome,</b> but somewhat impractical in terms of utilisation of internal space.|$|E
25|$|After he regains {{his body}} in the fourth book, Rowling {{describes}} Voldemort as having pale skin, a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes and cat-like slits for pupils, a skeletally thin body and long, thin hands with unnaturally long fingers. As mentioned in {{the first chapter of}} the seventh book, he also has no hair or lips. Earlier in life, as seen through flashbacks contained in the second and sixth books, Tom Marvolo Riddle <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> and tall with pale skin, jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. He could charm many people with his looks. The transformation into his monstrous state {{is believed to have been}} the result of creating his Horcruxes and becoming less human as he continued to divide his soul. In the films, Voldemort's eyes are blue with round pupils.|$|E

25|$|As queen, {{the young}} Isabella faced {{numerous}} challenges. Edward <b>was</b> <b>handsome,</b> but highly unconventional, possibly forming close romantic attachments to first Piers Gaveston and then Hugh Despenser the younger. Edward found himself {{at odds with}} the barons, too, in particular his first cousin Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, whilst continuing the war against the Scots that he had inherited from Edward I. Using her own supporters at court, and the patronage of her French family, Isabella attempted to find a political path through these challenges; she successfully formed an alliance with Gaveston, but after his death {{at the hands of the}} barons her position grew increasingly precarious. Edward began to take revenge on his enemies, using an ever more brutal alliance with the Despenser family, in particular his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the younger. By 1326 Isabella found herself at increasing odds with both Edward and Hugh, ultimately resulting in Isabella's own bid for power and the invasion of England.|$|E
500|$|On 13 May 1817, Pedro {{was married}} by proxy to Maria Leopoldina. When {{she arrived in}} Rio de Janeiro on 5 November, she {{immediately}} {{fell in love with}} Pedro, who was far more charming and attractive than she had been led to expect. After [...] "years under a tropical sun, his complexion was still light, his cheeks rosy." [...] The 19-year-old prince <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> and a little above average in height, with bright dark eyes and dark brown hair. [...] "His good appearance", said historian Neill Macaulay, [...] "owed much to his bearing, proud and erect even at an awkward age, and his grooming, which was impeccable. Habitually neat and clean, he had taken to the Brazilian custom of bathing often." [...] The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy, occurred the following day. Seven children resulted from this marriage: Maria (later Queen Dona MariaII of Portugal), Miguel, João, Januária, Paula, Francisca and Pedro (later Emperor Dom PedroII of Brazil).|$|E
500|$|The {{reputation}} of Định and his southern rebels persisted long after his death. Phan Bội Châu, the leading Vietnamese revolutionary {{of the early}} 20th century, travelled into the south in 1904, seeking {{to start a new}} anti-French movement. He specifically attempted to recruit followers among the surviving elderly members of Định's movement. Định was highly regarded as a revolutionary hero by Vietnamese of both communist and anti-communist persuasions. In 1964, an article in the North Vietnamese Nghiên cứu lịch sửu described Định as [...] "the hero symbolising the spirit of resistance to the foreign colonialists of the people of Southern Viet-Nam". The same article extolled Định's physical appearance and his capabilities, stating [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> in appearance, understood the military manual and was a good shot". During the Vietnam War era, North Vietnamese historians sought to portray the Viet Cong—which fought against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the United States—as Định's modern successor. Định was also highly regarded among anti-communist South Vietnamese scholars. A prominent thoroughfare in the centre of Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam is named after him.|$|E

500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that {{she was said to}} be beautiful. The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen under her chin, and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> to look at, with a pretty mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E

2500|$|Khalife {{recorded}} {{the song in}} his 1995 album [...] "The Arabic Coffee Pot" [...] {{that was based on}} a 1992 poem of the prominent Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish. The poem adapted this verse from the story of Yousef (Joseph) in the Qur'an: [...] "O my father, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowing before me in homage." [...] It tells the story of how Joseph's brothers were jealous of him because he <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> and kind, his brothers don't like him. The story reflected the suffering of the Palestinian people.|$|E

[...] Added to this he was highly intelligent and had been very well educated; an excellent sense of humour rounded off a personality that was the life and soul of any party or other situation. [...] To judge by his surviving letters and drawings, he was a sensitive writer and an excellent artist.|$|E
2500|$|By this point, Li Kui {{also had}} the {{additional}} office of deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang). [...] He was displeased with how the officials {{in charge of the}} imperial examinations at the time were making their testing questions test highly obscure facts, and he believed that this led to the selection of examinees who were not necessarily talented or capable in writing. [...] He therefore, at the examinations, made the Confucian classics, histories, and qieyun references available to the examinees for them to look through the books during examination. [...] He was much praised for this reform. [...] It was also said that Li Kui <b>was</b> <b>handsome</b> in appearance and capable in rhetoric. [...] Emperor Suzong once told him, [...] "You, sir, are the highest grade in your clan's prominence, in your appearance, and in your writing." ...|$|E

At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets. His friends quickly chided and mocked him for his act of charity. When he got home, his father scolded him in rage.|$|E
