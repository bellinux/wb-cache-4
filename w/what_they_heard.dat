After {{joining forces}} with fellow musician, Norah Chambers, a {{graduate}} of the Royal Academy of Music in London, the pair formed a camp choir. Dryburgh wrote down pages of music from memory, from baroque to contemporary, for the Vocal Orchestra to perform, as well as pieces of her own light classical compositions. The music was arranged in four parts, which were hummed by the women to give the effect of an orchestra, and included pieces by Handel, Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven. Even the Japanese soldiers were said to be amazed at <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard,</b> inviting themselves to the concerts. The Captives' Hymn was one of the pieces written by Dryburgh, and was sung each Sunday during church services.|$|E
25|$|However, Mr M’Culloch was keenly {{interested}} in Calvinist theology of conversion and followed closely {{the work of}} the great preachers and their effects in Britain and British North America. His son had for some time been a trader in the colonies, but besides that, the West of Scotland had very close contact with them, as Glasgow merchant ships had several weeks’ advantage over other ships in the transatlantic trade. He received many letters from there describing the Great Awakening which he read out (instead of sermons) to his congregation. He also read out copies of sermons collected from there and printed by John Erskine the famous Evangelical. In 1741, the great Methodist preacher George Whitefield came to Scotland, partly to raise money for his orphanage in Georgia. His stops included Leith and Glasgow. This was attended by several of Mr M’Culloch's congregation, who belonged to local prayer and discussion groups called Fellowships. They were much affected by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> and saw. On their return to Cambuslang they sought some spiritual help from their minister, Mr M’Culloch.|$|E

25|$|Frehley {{spent the}} early 1970s {{in a series}} of local bands {{including}} one called Molimo who recorded half an album for RCA Records in 1971. In late 1972, his friend, Chris Cassone, spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in The Village Voice and showed the ad to Frehley. Frehley went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar. Frehley auditioned for a band later named Kiss members Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (bass guitar) and Peter Criss (drums). Frehley, who showed up with best friend Chris Cassone, wearing one red and one orange sneaker, was less than impressive visually, but the band liked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> from his playing. About three weeks later, the band named Frehley as their lead guitarist. By January 1973, and they didn't have a name but later came up with the name Kiss. Frehley designed the band's double-lightning-bolt logo, which was polished up by Paul Stanley. The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances, and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes. When the group eventually decided to adopt stage personas to match their makeup and costumes, Frehley became Space Ace. Later his stage persona was also known as The Spaceman.|$|E
500|$|When the {{completed}} album was played for an assembled group of executives at Columbia's headquarters in California, several were reportedly unimpressed by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard.</b> [...] Matters {{had not been}} helped when Columbia Records offered Waters smaller publishing rights {{on the grounds that}} The Wall was a double album, a position he did not accept. When one executive offered to settle the dispute with a coin toss, Waters asked why he should gamble on something he owned. He eventually prevailed. The record company's concerns were alleviated when [...] "Another Brick in the Wall Part 2" [...] reached number one in the UK, US, Norway, Portugal, Israel, West Germany and South Africa.

Unbeknownst to them, each year that Jack McCain was CINCPAC, he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in South Vietnam serving closest to the DMZ; he would stand alone and look north, to be as close to his son as he could get. By 1971, some 30–50percent of the POWs had become disillusioned about the war, both because of the apparent lack of military progress and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> of the growing anti-war movement in the U.S., and some of them were less reluctant to make propaganda statements for the North Vietnamese. McCain was not among them: he participated in a defiant church service and led an effort to write letters home that only portrayed the camp in a negative light, and as a result spent much of the year in a camp reserved for [...] "bad attitude" [...] cases.|$|E

Although Milius had reservations when he witnessed the first few takes of the novices at work, he put faith in them improving their skills {{on the job and}} altered the script to fit their abilities. Schwarzenegger had studied for weeks in 1980 under Robert Easton, a voice coach for several Hollywood stars, to improve his speech. His first line in the film was a paraphrasing of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan's speech about the good things in life and the actor delivered it with a heavy Austrian accent; critics later described <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> as [...] "to crush your enemiessee dem [...] driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of dair vimen [...] ". Subsequently, Schwarzenegger underwent intensive speech training with Milius. [...] Each of his later longer speeches was rehearsed at least 40 times.

30|$|Provided {{that working}} memory plays {{a crucial role}} in EFL {{language}} comprehension, it may also be important in EFL listening comprehension, according to Wu (1998), when task demands are high, due to storage and processing needs, the computation will slow down, and thus some partial results from working memory processing may be forgotten. This may account for the fact that EFL listeners often {{seem to be able to}} hear everything, but either forget <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have <b>heard</b> easily or cannot process <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have <b>heard</b> into meaning relationships. Accordingly, EFL listening comprehension depends on the storage and processing of information by the mind. Therefore, working memory may influence EFL listening co m prehension.|$|R

2500|$|Early in {{his career}} Skinner became {{interested}} in [...] "latent speech" [...] and experimented with a device he called the [...] "verbal summator."

2500|$|Yamaguchi {{wanted to}} create an album that began and ended with {{instrumental}} tracks. He felt that [...] "Structure" [...] in its demo state {{would have been a}} weak album opener, so he began to work on other songs. While Yamaguchi was creating these tracks, he happened to talk to electronic musician Aoki Takamasa, who agreed to collaborate with the band on a new version of [...] "Structure" [...] and another song, [...] "Inori". Yamaguchi saw [...] "Inori" [...] and [...] "Structure" [...] as being the complete opposite of external-focused songs on the album, and he wanted the songs to remain as instrumentals so that listeners could focus on the music without the images created by lyrics affecting <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard.</b> [...] "Structure"'s demo version was the first song the band recorded in the album sessions. In its original form, it had an arpeggio guitar-like arrangement, similar in feel to the B-side of their [...] "Boku to Hana" [...] single, [...] "Neptunus". Yamaguchi created the song as an experiment, {{to see if he could}} take a guitar-composed song and turn it into dance music. The demo originally had lyrics in its final section, but Yamaguchi believed that the lyrics worked against the images listeners would be constructing while listening to it. [...] "Inori", among other songs on the album, were composed without a guitar, going against their previous convention of only releasing songs that could be performed solely with a guitar. Yamaguchi wanted [...] "Inori" [...] to be the first song on the album to surprise listeners who had only heard their externally focused songs with commercial tie-ups, and believed that this would set the tone for the album. Yamaguchi saw [...] "Inori" [...] as being the most internally focused song on the album.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{aptly named}} book, What We Knew: Terror, Mass Murder, and Everyday Life in Nazi Germany, historians Eric Johnson and Karl-Heinz Reuband {{conducted}} an extensive set of interviews (over 3,000 Germans and 500 German Jews) for an unprecedented firsthand look at {{daily life in}} the Third Reich and analyzed it accordingly. They carefully selected interviews out of the samples, which they believed best represented their overall findings. From the Jewish questionnaires, the authors found that German society {{was not nearly as}} rife with anti-Semitism as one might otherwise have believed, but this changed dramatically with Hitler's ascension to power. German Jews claimed that they knew of the Holocaust {{from a wide range of}} sources, which included radio broadcasts from Italy and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> from friends or acquaintances, but they did not know these details until 1943. Responses from non-Jewish Germans indicate that [...] "the majority of Germans identified with the Nazi regime." [...] Contrary to many other accounts and/or historical interpretations, which portray rule under the Nazis as terrifying for German citizens, most of the German respondents who participated in the interviews stated that they never really feared arrest from the Gestapo. Concerning the mass murder of the Jews, the survey results were contingent to some degree on geography, but roughly 27–29% of Germans had information about the Holocaust at some point before the war's end, and another 10–13% suspected something terrible was happening all along. Based on this information, Johnson and Reuband surmise that one-in-three Germans either heard or knew that the Holocaust was taking place before the end of the war from sources which included family members, friends, neighbors or professional colleagues. Johnson suggests (in disagreement with his co-author) that it is more likely that about 50% of the German population were aware of the atrocities being committed against the Jewish people and other enemies identified by the Nazi regime.|$|E
