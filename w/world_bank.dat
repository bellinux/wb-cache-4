Oil production began in 2003 with {{the completion of a}} pipeline (financed in part by the <b>World</b> <b>Bank)</b> that links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon. As a condition of its assistance, the <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount.

5|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> and International Monetary Fund were {{designed}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the <b>World</b> <b>Bank,</b> then consisting of only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, became operational in 1946. Robert L. Garner joined the <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could {{play an important role}} in international development. In 1950, Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private investments in the developing countries served by the Bank. The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments, without managing those enterprises, and by collaborating with third party investors. When describing the IFC in 1955, <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in private firms, rather than make loans to governments, and it would not manage the projects in which it invests. In 1956 the International Finance Corporation became operational under the leadership of Garner. It initially had 12 staff members and $100 million ($844.9 million in 2012 dollars) in capital. The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $2 million ($16.4 million in 2012 dollars) loan to a Brazil-based affiliate of Siemens & Halske (now Siemens AG). In 2007, IFC bought 18% stake in the Indian Financial firm, Angel Broking. In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them: Alpha Bank (60 million), Eurobank (50 million), Piraeus Bank (20 million) and National Bank of Greece (20 million).|$|E
