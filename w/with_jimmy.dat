60|$|In {{accordance}} <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy's</b> plan, the C.P.A.'s were to {{give out}} no information to any one, even to Mr. Compton, until their investigation and report were entirely completed. This plan had been approved by Mr. Compton, although he professed to be at considerable loss to understand why it was necessary.

Mondale ran <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human rights as their first priority, and he was there to address the subject pertaining to Latin America.

5|$|In the credits, the re-imagined {{series is}} said {{to be based on the}} 1976 novel by Terry Nation; however, there are a number of {{differences}} between the series and its source material. In the novel, Jenny Richards survives, whereas her counterpart in the 2008 series, Jenny Collins, does not; this means that Greg Preston and Jenny cannot have a child as the years unfold. Abby Grant still falls in love <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Garland; however, in the book, he eventually dies from septicaemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the match meant it was selected for live broadcast by ITV across their entire network, with on-site presentation by Jim Rosenthal, by then one of ITV Sport's main presenters, who shared the studio <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Greaves. Two separate commentary teams were used: one, consisting of ITV's senior commentator Brian Moore, Terry Yorath and Ian St. John, covered the game for the English and Welsh regions of the network, while the other, with Jock Brown and Joe Jordan, was for viewers in the Scottish ITV areas.|$|E

In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34percent, which placed him on par <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Carter and Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24percent). According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22percent, the lowest in American history.|$|E

50|$|Timmy Two-Teeth: Jimmy Two-Teeth's son was {{introduced}} in episode 1, along <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy's</b> ex-wife and Timmy's mother, Mary Two-Teeth. Timmy is a young rat diagnosed with terminal Tourette syndrome; as a consequence, {{a large part of}} his speech is censored (although in a sense of irony, he doesn't really swear, but says stuff like 'Heck yeah' or 'Have a flippin' day'). Despite this, he maintains a positive outlook on life. He dies in episode 5 and his soul goes to hell due to both Sam & Max's intervention (unlike his father, Timmy has lived a sin-free life, but his personal record was switched <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy's</b> at the moment of his death), but later his soul is released and Timmy comes back to life. He is also a great fan of the Soda Poppers (recurring characters from Season 1) and knows everything about them.|$|R
5|$|Doro {{signed a}} {{worldwide}} {{contract with the}} major record label WEA (now Warner Music Group) {{at the end of}} 1995 and started writing new material with Jürgen Engler and Chris Lietz of the German industrial metal and EBM band Die Krupps, who she had met while working on remixes of songs from Machine II Machine. Doro also worked on other songs <b>with</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Harry and Fred Maher in the US. The resulting album, titled Love Me in Black, took three years to be completed and features a massive use of electronics and drum machines, along with a heavier sound than its predecessors. WEA judged the album unsuitable for the US market and published it only in Germany. American guitarist Mario Parrillo (ex-Detente and Fear of God) joined Taylor, Douglas and the returning Johnny Dee in Doro's band for the following tour, which included another participation at the Wacken Open Air festival.|$|E
5|$|He later {{joined the}} then-WWF in 2001, and was {{assigned}} to Heartland Wrestling Association, a developmental territory, where he won the HWA Tag Team Championship with Evan Karagias.

Between late 2003 and 2005, Moore was used mainly in WWE's cruiserweight division, until his release in July 2005. After a stint on the independent circuit, Moore joined TNA in December 2005. In March 2006, he re-signed with WWE, initially appearing on the ECW brand, before returning to SmackDown in 2007.

Morrison filmed the concerts at the Orpheum Theatre so they could be viewed by Farrah Fawcett, confined to bed with cancer and thus unable to attend the concerts.|$|E
