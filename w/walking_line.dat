[...] The live Airplane album Bless Its Pointed Little Head, {{recorded}} in 1968, demonstrates Casady's unique <b>walking</b> <b>line</b> style to the fullest, as his Guild Starfire bass signal was delivered through a Versatone amplifier which gave his instrument a distinctive growling sound when played in the higher register. The Fred Neil track [...] "The Other Side of This Life" [...] remains the quintessential example of his style. On later Airplane albums, such as Bark, Long John Silver and the live Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, Casady switched over to a $4,000 custom-made Alembic bass ( [...] 001, the first made by the company) dubbed [...] "Mission Control". The extraordinarily grand sound Casady produced during his 1968-1971 heyday—nowhere better heard than in his multi-tracked playing on [...] "Sunrise," [...] a song from Paul Kantner's 1970 solo album Blows Against the Empire—inspired fans to assign him the affectionate nickname of [...] "God." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - <b>Walking</b> <b>Line</b> Assembly (WLA) is {{performed}} by positioning workers along assembly line at every process {{stations in the}} production line as and when required. This has benefitted the assembly and fabrication industry {{without the need for}} a dedicated layout, thereby leading to reduction in the fixed costs. This paper describes the application of WLA in prototype fabrication of yoke sub-assembly and details its effectiveness. The WLA procedure is described in two parts: Part I presents the technical aspects and challenges involved in development and fabrication of engine mount yoke tube assembly for a civil aircraft. This highlights the importance and significance of the parts, brackets, dimensional robustness, procedures, assembly, jigs and fixtures associated and the necessity of categorizing it as Class- 1. Activities representing reverse engineering process and fabrication of yoke tube are detailed comprehensively. Part II presents the WLA model adopted for this assembly. Comparison with conventional methods and layouts of fixed and <b>walking</b> <b>line</b> assembly are done. Further, WLA is modified with a common stage set on every process where the expected capability of the task in shop floor is brought out in consensus with the operational demand and standards. This is achieved with very little disturbance to the existing aircraft fixed line fabrication set up. This model has given encouraging results by expediting the processes and provides an ideal option for building of prototypes in development stage of an aircraft project.

It will contextualise Paul Lewin&# 039;s practice in the history of Cornish painting, the tradition of en plein work, but will also offer a commentary on the artist&# 039;s sojourn across West Penwith. The book will also include an interview between the painter and writer which will cover the artist&# 039;s approach to painting, his methods, materials and those artists and writers who matter most to him...|$|E

A patch-burn grazing (PBG) management technique was applied to four native tallgrass prairies in southwest Missouri to evaluate its effect on species richness and density of grassland birds. Treatment prairies were spring burned and grazed during the summer while control prairies were spring burned and ungrazed. Birds were identified while <b>walking</b> <b>line</b> transects in both the treatment and control units. Distances were measured to all birds using laser rangefinders, and estimated densities for each species were generated using Program Distance v 5. 0. PBG prairies showed significantly greater species richness. Densities of Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) and Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) also were greater in PBG prairies. The {{results of this study suggest}} that PBG is a viable management technique to increase richness and density of species associated with short grasslands while not significantly reducing the density of those species associated with tall grasslands...|$|E

50|$|In 1967, in Chicago, Miles Davis saw Vitous {{playing with}} Clark Terry and {{invited him to}} join his group for a {{residency}} at New York’s The Village Gate.

A representative example of Vitouš's double bass playing is Now He Sings, Now He Sobs (1968), with Chick Corea on piano and Roy Haynes on drums.
