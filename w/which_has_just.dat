The Central Belt is where most of the main towns and cities are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E

When Will's fiancee, Emma, confronts her about this request, Sue admits that she wants Will's {{capacity}} for kindness for her child. Emma and Will's relationship becomes strained as he focuses on impressing Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) to win tenure, and denigrates her newest set of counseling pamphlets. He is surprised when Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) enthusiastically praises Emma for her recent pamphlet on genital sanitation, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> been adopted by the Big Ten football teams.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} {{on a tiny}} island called Morrowland (original German: Lummerland), <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> enough space for a small palace, a train station and rails all around the island, a grocery store, a small house, a king, two subjects, a {{locomotive}} named Emma, and a locomotive engineer {{by the name of}} Luke (Lukas) (who, as railway civil servant, is not a subject). One day, the postman – who has to come by ship – drops off a package with a nearly illegible address for a Mrs. Krintuuth at Zorroulend. On the back was a large 13. After a futile search for the addressee among Morrowland's few inhabitants, they open the package. To their immense surprise, there's a black baby inside. After the commotion has died down, the baby is adopted by the islanders and is named Jim Button.|$|E

This company decides to cooperate with the Avions company Marcel Dassault, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> made a success successfully of the development of the Mirage G. Two agreements are signed in 1968, for general cooperation and other one on the variable-geometry wings. For the competition VFX, the prototype LTV V-507, inspired by the Mirage G, is rejected to the benefit of the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. In the reading of the file of the LTV V-507, the Grumman company asks for numerous further information, in front of the interest of the technical solutions held for the Mirage G. The Pentagon envisages this plane as basis for the program Light Weight Fighter, but other solutions are used.|$|E
25|$|Quinn informs {{her that}} he found {{evidence}} that Sekou was set up, and that Porteous Belli (C. J. Wilson), an assassin working for Adal, has been spying on her. They go to the conspirators' safe house, where Belli attacks them. Quinn kills Belli, and finds evidence that the conspirators are planning to assassinate Keane. Moments later, however, the house is destroyed by a hidden bomb, taking the evidence with it. Carrie and Quinn rush to Keane's headquarters, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> received a bomb threat. During the evacuation, Adal calls Carrie and tells her that the bomb threat is a ruse to get Keane {{out of the building}}, where she can be assassinated, while Quinn is to be framed as the killer. Carrie stops Keane's vehicle from leaving, seconds before the decoy vehicle is destroyed. Quinn smuggles Carrie and Keane out of the building in his car and sacrifices his life to save them when a special ops team, answering to Adal, opens fire on them. Adal is arrested and Keane is inaugurated as President of the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{provision}} of athletics stadiums in England is very poor compared to most other developed countries. The {{main reason for}} this is that it is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track. This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds, which have not been forthcoming on a large scale. The largest athletics stadium built in the UK since the Second World War, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. The largest existing stadium is the 25,000 seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. London's largest athletics venue is Crystal Palace, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> 15,500 permanent seats. It will be superseded by the Olympic Stadium, which will be built as an 80,000 seater for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but will most likely be reduced to 60,000 seats after the Games with the London organising committee's decision to accept West Ham United's bid to take over the stadium. There are two Athletic stadiums in Birmingham the Alexander Stadium (12,700 capacity) which is home to UK Athletics and there is also the National Indoor Arena (14,150) which is also used for other events.|$|E

By the time West Ham moved in, the capacity was reduced to 60,000, and the track remained in place, with movable seating added to allow optimal configurations for both athletics and football. Since the retention of the track was a necessary condition for tenancy, the Olympic Stadium won the right to host the 2017 World Championships in Athletics.|$|E
25|$|Chimène {{is alone}} in {{a room in the}} palace and is torn apart by {{conflicting}} emotions: love, desire for revenge and honour. But she vows to avenge her father (Scene 1). The king enters and tries to console Chimène, treating her as his own daughter: he declares how fond he was of her dead father, but also reveals the respect in which everyone holds Rodrigue, the one man capable of leading the fight against the Moors. Nevertheless, the king promises to capture and punish her father's killer (Scene 2). Left alone with her maids, Chimène reveals her undying love for Rodrigue. She adored him before the fatal duel, and now that fate has divided them and all hope is dead, their love still remains intact. Nevertheless, she says she will do what honour demands, and the more she loves Rodrigue, the more she will seek to punish him (Scene 3). The next scene is taken up by a dramatic duet between Chimène and Rodrigue, who has just arrived: he begs her to kill him, but she fails to follow through with her vow of revenge, and the two are left in despair (Scene 4). Alone again, Rodrigue contemplates death (Scene 5), until he is met by his father and his followers, and asked to march against the army of the Moors <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> laid siege to the city. If he is to die, he should do so nobly for his king and country. Encouraged by his father's words, Rodrigue agrees to fight and the first act ends with a martial chorus (Scene 6).|$|E
