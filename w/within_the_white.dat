5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E

5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals {{the fact that most}} of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E

5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> matter {{at the core}} of the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E

25|$|In Afrikaans, the Voëlvry {{movement}} led by Johannes Kerkorrel, Koos Kombuis and Bernoldus Niemand in 1989, {{provided a}} voice of opposition from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> Afrikaner community.

The Underwoods convince Doug to take the fall for killing Zoe, and the leaker is revealed to be Frank himself.|$|E

25|$|Reviews of the 2000 census {{showed that}} African Americans have also left New York, but {{continued}} in-migration of young whites and immigrants has appeared {{to stabilize the}} white proportion of residents. Joseph J. Salvo, director of the New York Department of City Planning's population division, noted the diversity <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> population, as older European Americans are replaced by new immigrants, including the many Hispanics who identify as white. Similarly, black out-migration from Boston since 2000 resulted in the city's becoming majority white again by 2006.

The color yellow symbolizes gold in the state's hills, and red the colored earth to which the word Colorado refers.
