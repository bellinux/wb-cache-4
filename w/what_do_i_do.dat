500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now that I have a franchise, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When she all {{but found}} {{it out for}} herself, whose {{influence}} was used to make him own it? Mine! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> {{when he tried to}} confess it, and failed to make her understand him? <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> when she first committed the mistake of believing me to be the disfigured man?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The boy says [...] "aman!". The Arabic word [...] "aman" [...] (secure me / help / please) is {{an exclamation}} of lasting pain and long distress. It {{is used in}} Azerbaijani [...] "neynim aman, aman" [...] (<b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> please!), Turkish [...] "Leylim aman" [...] (my Leyli, please!) and Armenian [...] "dle aman" [...] (my heart, please!).|$|E
2500|$|Marquis {{tossed a}} {{scoreless}} inning of relief in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series at Boston, and Manager Tony La Russa tabbed Marquis to start Game 4. He {{turned in the}} best performance of any Cardinals starter in the series, pitching 6 innings and giving up 3 runs. He was bested, however, by Boston pitcher Derek Lowe, who threw shutout ball for 7 innings to win the series for the Red Sox. [...] "Whether you lose 100games or win 100games {{and go to the}} World Series, {{the last day of the}} season you're still looking around and saying, 'The season is over? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now?' [...] " [...] said Marquis as he stuffed jerseys into a duffel bag. [...] "It's hard to handle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{contribution}} to the country music genre was rewarded when the Country Music Association voted her the [...] "Female Vocalist of the Year" [...] in 1991, though she missed the event, having just given birth to her second child. Eight consecutive singles reached the top 10 in the early 1990s, including [...] "Down to My Last Teardrop", [...] "(Without You) <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do</b> with Me", and [...] "Two Sparrows in a Hurricane". In 1990, Tucker was named [...] "Female Video Artist of the Year" [...] by CMT. Although by the 1990s, she no longer had number=one hits, many singles came close peaking in the country top five, {{as well as the}} top 10. Tucker {{was one of the most}} successful female country artists at the time. She became one of the few teen stars to find success in her adult years.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 January 2007, {{the punk}} wave {{magazine}} Side-Line {{broke the story}} the Police would reunite for the Grammys, and would perform [...] "Roxanne". Side-Line also stated the Police were {{to embark on a}} massive world tour. Billboard magazine later confirmed the news, quoting Andy Summers' 2006 statement as to how the band could have continued post-Synchronicity: [...] "The more rational approach would have been, 'OK, Sting, go make a solo record, and let's get back together in two or three years.' I'm certain we could have done that. Of course we could have. We were definitely not in a creative dry space. We could have easily carried on, and we could probably still be there. That wasn't to be our fate. It went in another way. I regret we never paid it off with a last tour." [...] The band opened the 49th Annual Grammy Awards on 11 February 2007 in Los Angeles, announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, we are the Police, and we're back!" [...] before launching into [...] "Roxanne". After the dissolution of the Police, Sting adamantly refused to reunite with Copeland or Summers for any prolonged period, often commenting [...] "If I ever reform the Police I should be certified insane." [...] However, by 2007, he had a change of heart. When asked what prompted the reunion, Sting said [...] "I'd just done the lute album—Songs from the Labyrinth. I was thinking: 'Well <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> What's going to surprise people?' I just had this instinct, this desire to call the guys up and say: 'Let's give this a go.'" [...] Sting added he saw the reunion as [...] "a kind of healing. I think solving problems is an exercise worth doing".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} 8 finale, [...] "The Commitment Determination", Sheldon and Amy {{get into a}} fight over their {{definition}} of [...] "commitment". [...] Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has {{decided to take a}} break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. [...] He glumly turns to his Gollum figurine and asks it, [...] "Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> with this one?", while simultaneously taking his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom, out of this desk drawer. In the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In [...] "The Earworm Reverberation", Sheldon can't get a song out his head but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that Amy changed his life for the better and then goes to her apartment to profess his love, at which time Amy reciprocates. [...] Amy's date that night was Dave, who has great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect; after seeing how much they love each other, Dave urges Sheldon to kiss Amy. [...] In the following episode, [...] "The Opening Night Excitation" [...] Leonard, Wolowitz and Raj go to see [...] without Sheldon as he has somewhat reluctantly opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. [...] As Amy made Sheldon's birthday party enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate. [...] He tells them that he has narrowed things down to 3 options, the first being a chance to play the harp with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's ornithophobia is nothing compares to his Ovinophobia, the fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in coitus, at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. In the tenth season, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility. Afterwards, they decide to move in together permanently. In the final episode of the season, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki; the eleventh season premiere was basically a continuation of this, and Amy accepts his proposal.|$|E

6000|$|She steadied {{herself against}} the table with one hand, and put the other hand to her head. Her brain was giddy. The effort to think {{was too much for}} her. She said to herself, vacantly, [...] "The inn? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> at the inn?" ...|$|R

I have outlived the kindest and most princelike of masters. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{on the earth}} since the dismal thirtieth of January? The {{parricide}} of that day was a signal to all true servants of Charles Stewart to avenge his death, or die as soon after as they could find a worthy opportunity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, {{it is the}} {{development}} of a new era," [...] Crawshay replied, with dignity. [...] "Just consider what actually happened. I miss the steamer, owing to the breakdown of the Chicago Limited and a subsequent automobile accident. I arrive at the dock whilst you are in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> What no one else has ever done before! I fly after you!

6000|$|... "You shall hear. We {{are still}} at breakfast, all silent--for what have we to talk about here? What have we but our devotions, our kitchen-garden, and our wretched, wretched bits of breakfasts and dinners? I say we are all silent, when there comes {{suddenly}} such a ring at the bell as never was heard before--a very devil of a ring--a ring that caught us all with our bits--our wretched, wretched bits!--in our mouths, and stopped us before we could swallow them. 'Go, brother of mine,' says the father superior to me, 'go; it is your duty--go to the gate.' I am brave--a very lion of a Capuchin. I slip out on tiptoe--I wait--I listen--I pull back our little shutter in the gate--I wait, I listen again--I peep through the hole--nothing, absolutely nothing that I can see. I am brave--I am not to be daunted. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> next? I open the gate. Ah! sacred Mother of Heaven, what do I behold lying all along our threshold? A man--dead!--a big man; bigger than you, bigger than me, bigger than anybody in this convent--buttoned up tight in a fine coat, with black eyes, staring, {{staring up at the}} sky, and blood soaking through and through the front of his shirt. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> I scream once--I scream twice--and run back to the father superior!" ...|$|E

Would you have us three--you and Kahn and myself--travel arm in arm and speak never a word to our fellow passengers? Would you have us {{proclaim}} to all the world that we are on a secret mission, carrying a secret document, to obtain which we have already committed a crime?

That won't do, you know; that ain't what I'd a right to expect. If I had stumbled on a serpent and got bit; or stumbled on a first-rate patriot, and got bowie-knifed, or stumbled on a lot of Sympathisers with inverted shirt-collars, and got made a lion of; I might have distinguished myself, and earned some credit.

6000|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh dear! [It rings again. She looks scared. It rings again. She {{approaches}} it timidly. It rings again. She retreats hastily. It rings repeatedly.

Oh, I can hear you speaking quite distinctly. [She sits down, delighted, and settles herself for a conversation.] How wonderful! What! A lady? Oh! a person. Oh, yes: I know. Yes, please, send her up. Have my servants finished their lunch yet? Oh no: please don't disturb them: I'd rather not. It doesn't matter. Thank you. What? Oh yes, it's quite easy.
