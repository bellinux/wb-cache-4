The episode features former American President Theodore Roosevelt {{with the use of}} archival audio recordings. The use of Roosevelt's voice was first announced at the San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, on July 23, 2011. Showrunner Al Jean revealed to the press that [...] "we [...] have actual audio of Roosevelt (taken from a speech circa 1918) in the show. I thought, 'Finally! <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> a president in the show.' And a good one too. We're going to give him a little credit at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Nine Inch Nails has {{reportedly}} {{been used by}} the U.S. military as music torture to break down the resolve of detainees. Reznor objected to the use of his music in this way with the following message {{on the front page of}} the Nine Inch Nails website: [...] "It's difficult for me to imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you've put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture. If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities.

Because then {{it would just be}} like composing something that would be just like every other sort of orgasm that I've ever had. And because its really the center of the record, I really wanted there to be a more infinite tone, to this concept of Art+Pop, that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> art in the front and not have the corporate world to control in art anymore.

500|$|With {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II in late 1941, Landis wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, inquiring as to the wartime status of {{baseball}}. The President responded urging Landis to keep baseball open, foreseeing that even those fully engaged in war work would benefit from inexpensive diversions such as attending baseball games. [...] Many major leaguers enlisted or were drafted; even so Landis repeatedly stated, [...] "We'll play as long as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> nine men on the field." [...] Although many of the teams practiced at their normal spring training sites in 1942, beginning the following year {{they were required to}} train near their home cities or in the Northeast.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Bianco for USA Today wrote of Chenoweth's guest appearance: [...] "Her presence {{may not make}} much sense, but that's probably all right. If it means hearing Chenoweth sing, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> up with any explanation the show cares to offer." [...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal was equally positive regarding Chenoweth's role, praising her [...] "powerful voice", [...] "kittenish mien" [...] and [...] "commanding presence". Flandez deemed the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] the show's best number since [...] "Don't Stop Believin debuted in the pilot episode. Mike Hale of the New York Times similarly stated that [...] "The Rhodes Not Taken" [...] was [...] "the best episode musically since the pilot", calling the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] "truly rousing". TV Guide included the renditions of [...] "Somebody To Love" [...] and [...] "Maybe This Time" [...] in its list of Glee best performances so far. Jarett Wieselman for the New York Post called the episode: [...] "the smartest, funniest, heart-warmingest, song-tastic-est episode of the show yet." ...|$|E

50|$|While adults {{might find}} such stories tedious (<b>we</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>put</b> {{together}} what's going to happen), {{children tend to}} adore repetitious stories, since they can more easily remember and repeat the lines.

500|$|On the season's {{potential}} for crossover {{with the rest}} of the MCU, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "I think [...] year worked really well—we got to be our own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us. Ant-Man comes out this summer and will have come and gone before we air again in September, so whether there's anything vestigial from that or for [...] next season is to be determined. But we're in contact with the movie people and them with us, and any time <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> little easter eggs in, it's a lot of fun for die-hard fans." [...] Bell also stated that there was a possibility of Hayley Atwell once again reprising her role as Peggy Carter in the season for an Agent Carter crossover, and after the series acknowledged the character's death in Civil War, added, [...] "Any time we can make a connection to her, whether in a flashback or dealing with what’s happening now, it makes the universe smaller." ...|$|E

They honeymooned at McKinney's camp near Quebec City, Canada and were visited by former president Theodore Roosevelt, who invited himself, saying: [...] "I've always wanted to meet Jean Webster. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> up a partition in the cabin." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Ooni of Ile-Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade, the Olubuse II, at the {{launching}} of Ekiti State Historical and Royal Compendium in December, 2013, bemoaned the growing revisionism of Ekiti history by few senior traditional rulers in Yoruba land ‘claiming to be what they are not’ [...] which ought to be ‘set aside.’ [...] He counsels that ‘until <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> such people in order, {{it will be impossible}} to have a lasting peace in Yoruba land.’ [...] Ooni further remarked thus: ‘the very foundation of the historical antecedents of progenitors and founders of the dynasty are being daily twisted, concocted, reconfigured and rewritten only for personal egos, selfish reasons and individual satisfaction.’ The foregoing statement is fallout of the characteristics and framework of power politics and interaction patterns thst persist among Ekiti Obas and their people since the 19th century. It also suggests that it is a mirage and inconceivable historical assumption that Ekitiland is totally united and subordinate to each other.|$|E
