5|$|Details {{about the}} game were first {{confirmed}} {{to the general public}} in the May 2003 issue of , in which the game was called Mortal Kombat VI, and an online mode was confirmed. On February 6, 2004, Midway registered the domain names mkdeception.com and mortalkombatdeception.com. When Midway Entertainment <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> Mortal Kombat: Deception was the official title, the developers gave no answers at that time. Later that month, Midway released the first trailer from the game, confirming this title.|$|E

Joining Gorham was original drummer Brian Downey, long-standing keyboardist Darren Wharton, Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell, and singer Ricky Warwick from The Almighty, while Marco Mendoza returned to fill the bass guitar role. Ex-Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to participate but had previous commitments to his own solo career.|$|E

His answer was that he had two: First, he wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted to be an American citizen.|$|E

5|$|Tome of the Unknown is a {{short film}} {{directed}} by Patrick McHale, who also wrote and storyboarded it. Not long after he graduated college, McHale pitched {{the idea for the}} film, among other concepts, to Cartoon Network. At the time, the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films, though this never came to fruition. McHale <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> it was possible to adapt the idea for Tome of the Unknown to feature length. This proved unsuccessful as he felt it needed to be episodic, laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E

5|$|Tired of the {{constant}} violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction. As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee {{the building of the}} Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly. His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} {{interview}} was videotaped, {{at the beginning of}} the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in {{the first interview}} are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} {{of his birth}} remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest Gallia Belgica, Gallia Narbonensis, or Northern Italy. His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator Gnaeus Julius Agricola implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to Lucius Fabius Justus in the Dialogus may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy. No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint {{that the two men}} had a common background. Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.|$|E

However, the Turkish president's office said that Erdoğan was not advocating a Hitler-style government when he called for a state system with a strong executive. Furthermore, that the Turkish president had declared the Holocaust, anti-semitism and Islamophobia as crimes against humanity and that it was out of the question for him to cite Hitler's Germany as a good example.|$|E

25|$|When the UK Channel 4 {{television}} program The Bermuda Triangle (1992) was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the Equinox series, the marine insurance market Lloyd's of London <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> {{an unusually large}} number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined {{that large numbers of}} ships had not sunk there. Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. United States Coast Guard records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.|$|E

25|$|By August 1991 the Scallon's {{were living}} in Mountain Brook, close to EWTN's {{headquarters}} where Damien now worked.

Say Yes became the first TV series she made for them. Three more followed: We Are One Body, Backstage and Dana and friends. With this exposure she became a popular Catholic music singer, appearing at conferences and public gatherings across America. Heart Beat Records, the US Catholic music label, issued a number of her music and prayer albums.|$|E
25|$|While {{working the}} {{attachment}} in Philadelphia, House <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> {{he could help}} one of Union's western branches in making the paper dishes, as they had trouble in drying them. When House produced samples with a round flange, the design was accepted and {{he was given a}} contract to build a machine that would make twenty thousand paper dishes in 10 hours. Much work was required to maintain the heat at 800 to 900 degrees, which was necessary to dry a dish in two (2) seconds. Mr. House involved a system of using superheated steam which kept the dies at red heat. The press was first tested at his factory in Bridgeport before being shipped to Clinton, Iowa.|$|E
25|$|After {{eleven years}} of marriage, George Boleyn {{was arrested in}} May 1536 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, accused of having had sexual {{intercourse}} with his sister, the Queen. Jane likely {{had little to do}} with these accusations, and it is usually Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester who is accredited by contemporaries with having provided the evidence against the Queen and her brother. There was no truth in these rumours, according to the vast majority of contemporary witnesses, but they provided the legal pretext that the Boleyns' enemies needed to send Lord Rochford to the block. Jane was mentioned only once during the trials, when George Boleyn <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> the Queen had relayed information about Henry's sexual troubles to her.|$|E

First, respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they avoided certain clothing and, if so, to list some examples. They <b>were</b> also <b>asked</b> why they avoided such clothing. Second, respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they avoided any styles of clothing, and if so, why they wanted to avoid being associated with those styles.|$|R

25|$|At {{midnight on}} New Year's Eve 1929, Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon {{the banks of}} the Ravi in Lahore. A pledge of {{independence}} was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of public attending the ceremony <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they agreed with it, {{and the vast majority of}} people were witnessed to raise their hands in approval. 172 Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment. The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26 January as Independence Day. The flag of India was hoisted publicly across India by Congress volunteers, nationalists and the public. Plans for a mass civil disobedience were also underway.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if Monica's disorder is amusia, she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note. Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group. Further tests showed that Monica struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music. Interestingly, a later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.|$|E

On May 20, she <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> Albizu Campos used any of the Party's funds for himself and she stated no, she also insisted that any questions in regard to the Nationalist Party should be directed at Albizu Campos, since he is the spokesperson of the party's ideals. She was then asked if Albizu Campos gave the order that resulted in the Nationalist Uprisings of October 30, 1950 and she responded that Albizu Campos was unaware of many of the actions which involved the Nationalists. She stated that to the best of her knowledge Albizu Campos {{had nothing to do with}} the uprisings.|$|E
