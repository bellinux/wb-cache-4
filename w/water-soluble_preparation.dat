40|$|Although it is {{recognised}} {{that high}} levels of dietary insoluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) depress growth in pigs (1), trials investigating the effect of dietary soluble NSPs (sNSP) on performance have produced inconsistent results, {{depending on the type}} of grain fed, age of pig and other interacting factors. Diets with {{high levels of}} sNSP depress growth and have anti-nutritive properties when fed to poultry, and part of this effect is attributed to the ability of sNSP to increase the viscosity of intestinal digesta (2). A previous study into the effects of guar gum, a viscous water-soluble NSP, on the performance and health of weaner pigs showed a detrimental effect on growth and an exacerbation of experimental post-weaning colibacillosis caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli when this ingredient was fed (3). The aim of this study was to further investigate the potential detrimental effects of increased intestinal viscosity in weaner pigs by feeding them an experimental diet supplemented with carboxymethycellulose (CMC), a <b>water-soluble</b> <b>preparation</b> resistant to fermentation. The effect of increased viscosity on gastrointestinal development, growth performance and incidence of diarrhoea caused by haemolytic E. coli was monitored...|$|E

40|$|The {{isolation}} of non-cellulosic polysaccharides from both almond shells and their solid residue after autohydrolysis using a two-step alkaline extraction without and {{in combination with}} short ultrasonic treatment was investigated. The obtained polysaccharide preparations were characterized by yield, chemical composition and structural features, and the antioxidant activity of the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>preparations</b> was discussed {{in relation to the}} content of phenolics. The results suggested that, depending on the extraction conditions used, xylan associated to various extent with pectic polysaccharides and phenolics can be prepared, and the reaction time significantly shortened by application of ultrasound. The xylan polymers might serve as biopolymer sources in native form or after targeted modification for production of value-added substances and polysaccharide-based antioxidants, applicable in food, cosmetics and other areas...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that glucosamine/chitosan {{derivatives}} have the ability of inhibiting bacterial adhesion to tooth and biomaterial surfaces. The hypotheses of this article included 1) the inhibition effects of different (chemically) glucosamine products are different and 2) more <b>water-soluble</b> glucosamine <b>preparation(s)</b> may have a superior inhibition effect. The basic testing systems are in vitro static adhesion models {{and the amount of}} the adhesion is evaluated by direct counting using epifluorecense microscopy. The test material is a smooth surfaced commercially pure titanium (cp-Ti). The bacterium tested is Staphylococcus aureus. The results showed that compared to the control samples (without glucosamine or chitosan coating) the sulfated p-GlcNAc and Sigma glucosamine HCl significantly inhibited S. aureus adhesion to titanium surfaces (94 % and 78 % respectively...|$|R

Successful efforts to decolonize patients have reduced the rates of these infections. Chlorhexidine is a <b>water-soluble</b> antiseptic <b>preparation</b> with broad activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, and yeasts [6]. Recent investigations of whole-body skin decolonization with chlorhexidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated reductions in the rates of VRE, MRSA, and Acinetobacter baumannii colonization, and an overall decrease {{in the incidence of}} central catheter-associated BSIs [7 – 10]. A previous meta-analysis of non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggested that the practice of daily bathing with chlorhexidine decreased hospital-acquired BSIs [11]. Subsequently, some RCTs of daily bathing with chlorhexidine in the ICU have appeared [12 – 14].|$|R

40|$|Lithium transition-metal orthosilicates {{with general}} formula Li 2 MSiO 4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, etc.) have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest due to their potentially high theoretical capacities arising from the possibility of the extraction of two Li-ions per formula unit.

40|$|Boswellic acid (BA) -containing {{extracts}} such as BSE have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity. In chronic schistosomiasis, the hepatic granuloma and fibrosis {{induced by}} egg deposition {{in the liver}} {{is the most serious}} pathological manifestations. However, little is known regarding the role of BAs in Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) egg-induced liver granuloma and fibrosis. In order to investigate the effect of a <b>water-soluble</b> complex <b>preparation</b> of BSE, BSE-CD, on S. japonicum egg-induced liver pathology, liver granuloma and fibrosis were induced by infecting C 57 BL/ 6 mice with 18 - 22 cercariae of S. japonicum. S. japonicum cercariae infected mice were injected with BSE-CD at the onset of egg granuloma formation (early phase BSE-CD treatment after 4 weeks infection) or after the formation of liver fibrosis (late phase BSE-CD treatment after 7 weeks infection). Our data show that treatment of infected mice with BSE-CD significantly reduced both the extent of hepatic granuloma and fibrosis. Consistent with an inhibition of NF-κB signaling as evidenced by reduced IκB kinase (IKK) activation, the mRNA expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-α) and MCP- 1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP- 1) was decreased. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) revealed that the content of α-SMA in liver tissue of BSE-CD treated mice was dramatically decreased. Our findings suggest that BSE-CD treatment attenuates S. japonicum egg-induced hepatic granulomas and fibrosis, at least partly due to reduced NF-κB signaling and the subsequently decreased expression of VEGF, TNF-α, and MCP- 1. Suppression of the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) may also be involved in the therapeutic efficacy of BSE-CD...|$|R
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{effects of}} beta-carotene, oil-soluble (bixin) and <b>water-soluble</b> (norbixin) annatto <b>preparations</b> and mixtures of these carotenoids with {{virgin olive oil}} polar extract were assessed in bulk olive oil and oil-in-water emulsions stored at 60 degreesC. Norbixin was the only carotenoid that inhibited the oxidative deterioration of lipids in both systems. Though bixin and beta-carotene did not retard autoxidation, their mixtures with the polar extract from virgin olive oil enhanced the antioxidant effect of the olive oil extract. Norbixin (2 mM) was of similar activity to delta-tocopherol (0. 1 mM) in stored oil. The combination of norbixin with ascorbic acid or ascorbyl palmitate in oil showed a reduction in formation of volatile oxidation products but not in peroxide value, compared with the analogous sample lacking norbixin. In olive oil-in-water emulsions, norbixin (2 mM) reduced hydroperoxide formation to a similar extent as delta-tocopherol (0. 1 mM), which in turn was a better antioxidant than alpha-tocopherol. A synergistic effect between norbixin and ascorbic acid or ascorbyl palmitate was observed in the emulsion systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activity of the}} polysaccharide chitosan towards different bacterial species has been extensively documented. The response mechanisms of bacteria exposed to this biopolymer and the exact molecular mechanism of action, however, have hardly been investigated. This paper reports the transcriptome profiling using DNA microarrays of the type-strain of Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579) exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of two <b>water-soluble</b> chitosan <b>preparations</b> with defined chemical characteristics (molecular weight and degree of acetylation (F(A))). The expression of 104 genes was significantly altered upon chitosan A (weight average molecular weight (M(w)) 36. 0 kDa, F(A)  =  0. 01) exposure and 55 genes when treated with chitosan B (M(w) 28. 4 kDa, F(A)  =  0. 16). Several of these genes are involved in ion transport, especially potassium influx (BC 0753 -BC 0756). Upregulation of a potassium transporting system coincides with previous studies showing a permeabilizing effect on bacterial cells of this polymer with subsequent loss of potassium. Quantitative PCR confirmed the upregulation of the BC 0753 gene encoding the K(+) -transporting ATPase subunit A. A markerless gene replacement method was used to construct a mutant strain deficient of genes encoding an ATP-driven K(+) transport system (Kdp) and the KdpD sensor protein. Growth of this mutant strain in potassium limiting conditions and under salt stress {{did not affect the}} growth pattern or growth yield compared to the wild-type strain. The necessity of the Kdp system for potassium acquisition in B. cereus is therefore questionable. Genes involved in the metabolism of arginine, proline and other cellular constituents, in addition to genes involved in the gluconeogenesis, were also significantly affected. BC 2798 encoding a chitin binding protein was significantly downregulated due to chitosan exposure. This study provides insight into the response mechanisms of B. cereus to chitosan treatment and the significance of the Kdp system in potassium influx under challenging conditions...|$|R
40|$|Solid dispersions are {{a useful}} {{approach}} {{to improve the}} dissolution rate and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the physicochemical properties and bioavailability of a poorly <b>water-soluble</b> aprepitant by <b>preparation</b> of solid dispersions. The solid dispersions were characterized by dissolution, FTIR, XRPD, DSC, SEM and pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The dissolution rate of the aprepitant was significantly increased by solid dispersions, and XRD, DSC, and SEM analysis indicated that the aprepitant existed in an amorphous form within the solid dispersions. The result of dissolution study showed that the dissolution rate of SDs was nearly five-fold faster than aprepitant. FTIR spectrometry suggested the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the aprepitant and polymer. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats indicated that the degree drug absorption was comparable with that of Emend®. Aprepitant exists in an amorphous state in solid dispersions and the solid dispersions can markedly improve the dissolution and oral bioavailability of the aprepitant. The AUC 0 –t of the SDs was 2. 4 -fold that of the aprepitant. In addition, the method and its associated techniques are very easy to carry out...|$|R

Methods: First, excipients for enhancing the stability and solubility of sirolimus were screened. Second, using the SAS process, solid dispersions of sirolimus-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K 30 nanoparticles were prepared with or without surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), tocopheryl propylene glycol succinate, Sucroester 15, Gelucire 50 / 13, and Myrj 52. A mean particle size of approximately 250 nm was obtained for PVP K 30 -sirolimus nanoparticles. Solid state characterization, kinetic solubility, powder dissolution, stability, and pharmacokinetics were analyzed in rats. Results: X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated that sirolimus existed in an anhydrous amorphous form within a solid dispersion of nanoparticles and that no degradation occurred after SAS processing. The improved supersaturation and dissolution of sirolimus as a solid dispersion of nanoparticles appeared to be well correlated with enhanced bioavailability of oral sirolimus in rats. With oral administration of a solid dispersion of PVP K 30 -SLS-sirolimus nanoparticles, the peak concentration and AUC 0 &rarr; 12 h of sirolimus were increased by approximately 18. 3 -fold and 15. 2 -fold, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that preparation of PVP K 30 -sirolimus-surfactant nanoparticles using the SAS process may be a promising approach for improving the bioavailability of sirolimus.
