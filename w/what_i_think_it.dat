During the {{production}} of the album, several musicians and producers were recruited including American singer Mikky Ekko and producer Justin Parker. According to Ekko, the production of the album was massive, [...] "Their pace is insane. They had the studios we were working in booked out for three months, on a cycle. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before." [...] "Stay" [...] was written and produced by Parker, Ekko and Elof Loelv. Initially, when they wrote the song, Ekko didn't like it because of its vulnerability; however, collaborators convinced him to listen to [...] "Stay" [...] again. After another listen, he understood that the song is very important to him, [...] "The track had become so special to me as well, and knowing what the track means to me and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> means to her too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{little more}} conceit wouldn't hurt you," [...] said Honora, critically. [...] "You'll forgive me, Peter, if I tell you {{from time to}} time <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>It's</b> for your own good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} what {{happened}} because the facts came out in court and are known to everyone. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>it</b> is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and I've no call to tell that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I was {{inclined}} to think {{it at the time}} an enthusiastic flight. No matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> now. What I would emphasise is, that under the head of Pride your sister is a great and opportune example to you.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|But what do I mean by that? That {{ought to}} depend on what Moses meant by it. Moses meant what God meant, and unless I mean the same thing I must mean {{something}} wrong. And this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> does mean: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What fun it will be," [...] responded Tuppence. [...] "Marriage {{is called}} {{all sorts of}} things, a haven, and a refuge, and a {{crowning}} glory, and a state of bondage, and lots more. But do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'J. C. P. [...] "Of {{course you}} know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>it.</b> It {{is the very}} thing I have always longed for. I did have a general school here, as you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'There,' I said, as I put the parings {{into her}} hand. 'Just {{to show you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it.</b> There's bait and to spare. Go on and anaana me if you can.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is forcing}} {{his way in}} the sense that I meant it; and if I find that he gives further {{annoyance}} I shall tell him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> will not have you persecuted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is, Mr. Sisson?" [...] put in Lady Franks. [...] "I {{think you are}} just in a wicked state of mind: just that. Mr. Lilly, too. And you must be very careful, or some great misfortune will happen to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{does he do}} it, Bertie?" [...] he said. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is. I believe it's {{something}} to do with the shape of his head. Have you ever noticed his head, Bertie, old man? It sort of sticks out at the back!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{day or a}} year is all {{the same}} in the {{subconscious}} mind," [...] said Mrs. Grantly. [...] "The subconscious mind never forgets.

6000|$|... "Not {{more than}} they can make you sell Clavering Park. I do not, however, wish to be uncivil, and I will let you know through my lawyer <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>it.</b> All such matters are best managed by lawyers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} why I have come. My dear father, who has always been my best friend, is very ill. He is at Naples, and I must go to him. He is very old, you know,--over eighty; and will never live {{to come back to}} England. From <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hear, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{probable}} that <b>I</b> may remain with him till everything is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wrong, dear Margery!--but no matter. Let us get {{ourselves}} out of present difficulties, {{and into a}} place of safety; then I will tell you honestly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it,</b> and of you, too. Was your brother awake, dear Margery, when you left the family?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> very {{improper}} {{that these}} things should be said about a young woman; {{and as for the}} story of the duel, I don't believe a word of it. It is absurd. I dare say that Gustavus invented it at the moment, just to amuse himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My noble girl! And now, my heart's only treasure, I may {{speak out}} and tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> cannot be good that a woman should {{purchase}} rank and wealth by giving herself to a man she does not love. It must be bad,--monstrously bad. I never believed it when they told it me of you. And yet when I did not hear of you or see you for months--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{speaking}} with unwonted gravity; [...] "it {{may be hard}} to write, and to write lies at that; and God knows it is; but it's the square thing. It don't cost anything to say you're well and happy, and sorry you can't make a remittance this mail; and if you don't I'll tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is--I think it's about the high-water mark of being a brute beast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> don't see <b>what</b> {{there is}} to laugh at so much. When you ask me a thing I tell you just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>it</b> seems to set you off in a perfect gale. Don't you expect people {{to say what they}} think?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ian Gillan {{said about}} this song: [...] "There's this guy named Redbeard, from {{a radio station}} down in Texas. He phoned me up after it had been played on every radio station in America and said, 'Is this <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> about?' And <b>I</b> said, 'Yeah.' And he said, 'It's amazing, every radio station in America is playing a song written about anal sex and they don't even realize what's going on.' And I was like, well it's not in-your-face anal sex, it's just a joke. It just came about with the lyrics. It's no big deal. But it's a humorous thing and {{not meant to be}} offensive. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was just an afterthought. It {{certainly}} wasn't what inspired the song".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr Lynch, {{of course}} I {{know nothing of}} the {{absolute}} facts; but from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hear, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> as well to let the will alone. The Chancellor won't put a will aside in a hurry; it's always a difficult job--would cost an immense sum of money, which should, any way, {{come out of the}} property; and, after all, the chances are ten to one you'd be beat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allah {{lengthen}} your beard," [...] {{said the}} Sultan, {{and he added}} aside to me in English, which Toomuch Koffi evidently did not understand, [...] "I'm all eagerness {{to know what it}} is--it's something big, for sure." [...] The little man was quite quivering with excitement as he spoke. [...] "Do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is? I think it must be the American Intervention. The United States is going to intervene. Eh? What? Don't you think so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is, citizen. If you were {{standing}} {{just by the}} door of the lodge you had the back staircase of the house immediately behind you. The partition wall is very thin, and there is a disused door just there also. No doubt the voices came from there. You see, if there had been any aristos here," [...] he added naively, [...] "they could not have flown up the chimney, could they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He went {{straight}} {{home and at}} once wrote to the girl. The letter was a simple love-letter, and as such need not be given here. In what sweetest language he could find he assured her that even though he should never be allowed to see her or to hear from her, that still he should cling to her. And then he added this passage: [...] "If your love for me be <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> to be, no one can {{have a right to}} keep us apart. Pray be sure that I shall not change. If you change let me know it;--but I shall as soon expect the heavens to fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon, but not his,' said the squire, rubbing the wound. 'If {{he says a}} word more about John Caldigate in my presence, I shall tell him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>it.</b> He has got his wife, and {{that ought to be}} enough for him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Plantagenet, <b>what</b> can <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it</b> but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have expressed, {{that it is}} a {{wonderful}} event, but the happiest in my life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{necessary}} {{as a mere}} act of humanity to humour her. 'I will read it willingly,' said Henry, 'if you will go upstairs to bed. You shall hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it</b> to-morrow morning. Our heads will be clearer, we shall {{be better able to}} make the fourth act in the morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It pleased God {{to make me}} able to say {{all through}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was good for people to hear. All {{meetings}} and services (with a few, very few exceptions, from heavy rains, &c.) were crowded. I could not {{in a few minutes}} speak with any degree of completeness on subjects which for years had occupied my thoughts: I was generally {{about an hour and a}} half, occasionally longer--I tried to be shorter. But people were attentive and interested all through. At Melbourne, it was said that 1,500 children (at a meeting for them) were present, and 500 adults, including many of the most educated people. All, children included, were as still as mice for an hour and a half, except occasional cheers.|$|E
6000|$|... "P.S. I quite {{forgot to}} tell you, I sent out a servant some time ago to England to bring a couple of Horses. He will deliver some Packets to you; which I beg you will send, with Lord Marischal's compliments, to their {{respective}} Addresses. There is also a china cup for Mr. Macnamara, Lawyer, in the Temple or Lincoln's Inn, from the same person [lively old gentleman, age 91 gone; did die next year]. What does Eleanor mean about my Congratulatory Letter to Lord Suffolk [our Foreign Secretary, on his marriage lately]? I wished his Lordship, most sincerely, every happiness in his new state, as soon as I knew of it. I beg, however, Eleanor will do the like;--and {{although it is not}} my system to 'congratulate' anybody upon marriage, yet I never fail to wish them <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> is always two to one they do not obtain."

6000|$|... "DEAR MISS ANDERSON,--I {{have been}} acting on your parting advice {{to look out}} for that Mr. Lafflin of mine, and I have {{discovered}} that he is an unmitigated scamp. Consequently there is nothing more to keep me in Washington, and I should now like your advice about coming to Fortress Monroe. Do you find it malarial? On the boat your aunt asked me to come, but you said nothing about it, and I was left to suppose that you did not think it would agree with me. Do you still think so? or what do you think? I know you think it was uncalled for and in extremely bad taste for me to tell you what I did the other day; and I have thought so too. There is only one thing that could justify it--that is, I think it might justify it--if you thought so. But I do not feel sure {{that you would like to}} know it, or, if you knew it, would like it. I've been rather slow coming to the conclusion myself, and perhaps it's only the beginning of the end; and not the conclusion--if there is such a difference. But the question now is whether I may come and tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is--justify myself, or make things worse than they are now. I don't know that they can be worse, but I think I should like to try. I think your presence would inspire me.|$|E

6000|$|... "I like you, Miss Hannay," [...] she said, when, after {{a quarter}} of an hour's lively talk, the Major and his niece got up to go. [...] "I always say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>it</b> is very good natured of me to say so, for I don't {{disguise}} from myself that you will put my nose out of joint." ...|$|R
60|$|Something in her {{appearance}} troubled the hulking, blundering man. He {{could not have}} told <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was simply this--that Grizel no longer sat erect in her chair.|$|R
