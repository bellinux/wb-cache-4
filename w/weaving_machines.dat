In that time, along with modernized weaving factories which were established to meet demand for textiles on the domestic market, technological innovations {{in the field of}} weaving industry occurred in Korea. For instance, spinning and <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> were made for producing silk, so as to be substituted for high-cost machines from abroad.|$|E

25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with aramid in bulletproof vests.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLow-power {{humidity}} and temperature sensors fabricated on Kapton® polyimide sheets are successfully woven into textile using a conventional <b>weaving</b> <b>machine.</b> During <b>machine</b> <b>weaving</b> electronic devices undergo mechanical deformation, mostly due to bending, and shear forces. Bending radii in textiles {{can be as}} small as 165 μm during weaving, corresponding to a strain of about 15 %. This imposes stringent mechanical requirements on the textile integrated sensors. In this work, we present gas sensors on plastic foil with encapsulated active area for protection during stripes dicing, weaving, and operation.
