25|$|Drawing on Brunel's {{experience}} with the Thames Tunnel, the Great Western contained a series of impressive achievements—soaring viaducts {{such as the one}} in Ivybridge, specially designed stations, and vast tunnels including the Box Tunnel, which was the longest railway tunnel in the world at that time. There is an anecdote that the Box Tunnel may have been deliberately aligned so that the rising sun shines all the <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> on Brunel's birthday.|$|E
25|$|Two men, in {{the hope}} of {{finishing}} early, and contrary to established Leadhills custom, had entered the mine before 4AM; another two, presumably from the same partnership, entered soon after. Reaching their work level (at 25 fathoms) the first two encountered the bad air. They persisted, thinking they could force their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> began to feel dizzy, collapsed, and eventually suffocated. The next two encountered a similar fate. The accident was not discovered until some time after 6AM; by which time all of the four men were dead.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{important}} that the stirrup be the correct width for the boot. A stirrup that is too narrow will increase the chance that the boot will get caught in it (which would be very dangerous should the rider fall), and a too-wide stirrup makes it harder for a rider to keep it under the foot, and presents some risk that the foot might slip all the <b>way</b> <b>through.</b> <b>It</b> is generally suggested that the stirrup be no more than 1inch larger than the widest part of the sole of the rider's boots.|$|E

25|$|Combat {{between the}} two sides began, but the {{defenders}} were quickly overwhelmed when the Turks found a breach in the city wall and forced their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> The defenders tried to implement an orderly retreat, with the infantry being loaded onto boats and moved along the river while the cavalry covered their withdrawal, but the Turks continued to engage them and the commander of the reinforcements died in the chaos. With al-Mada'in now lost to them, the survivors made their way to Abu 'l-Saj's camp. Muhammad was angered by the result of the battle, and ordered several of those who had fought at al-Mada'in to be placed under house arrest.|$|E
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the <b>way</b> <b>through,</b> <b>it</b> does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E
500|$|In {{his writing}} Chatwin experimented with format. With In Patagonia, Clapp said Chatwin {{described}} the book's structure of 97 vignettes as [...] "Cubist." [...] "n other words," [...] she said, [...] "lots of small pictures tilting away and {{toward each other}} to create this strange original portrait of Patagonia." [...] The Songlines was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format. The book begins as a novel narrated {{by a man named}} Bruce but about two-thirds of the <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations, anecdotes, and summaries of others' research in an attempt to explore human restlessness. Some of Chatwin's critics did not think he succeeded in The Songlines with this approach, although others applauded his effort at trying an unconventional structure.|$|E

500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E
500|$|A further ECM album, Chants, led by Taborn {{and with}} bassist Thomas Morgan and drummer Gerald Cleaver, was {{released}} in 2013. This was the trio's first release after eight years together. At this point, Taborn's comments on composition and group performance were: [...] "I knew that if I created a context and then deferred, fully, to Gerald's and Thomas's sensibilities it would inherently be stimulating and would also challenge the context. [...] I'd much rather engage with the group, always, than have the format be 'piano adventures with supporting cast'." [...] This band began a tour of Europe in 2014, but Cleaver was replaced by J.T. Bates part of the <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> owing to illness. Earlier the same year, Taborn played in a small group led by guitarist Bill Frisell. Taborn played {{as part of the}} Ches Smith Trio late in 2014 and toured with the percussionist and Mat Maneri early in 2016. His sixth album as leader, , {{was released in}} 2016. The trio recording, with Christian McBride on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums, employed compositions by John Zorn. Taborn's next ECM album was the quartet Daylight Ghosts, which combined electronic and acoustic elements.|$|E

[...] "All the <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> was a fight with the admirals. Caltech's professor of physics, Dr. Charles Lauritsen, had developed a barrage rocket - ideal for landings to clean up the banks.

2500|$|During Nancy's {{relationship}} with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed {{due to her}} abuse {{at the hands of}} Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is [...] "very controlling" [...] towards Nancy and he takes away [...] "all the things that made Nancy Nancy – the way she was opinionated and outspoken". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake [...] "dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> all". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still [...] "keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake [...] "ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake [...] "plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened". The actor revealed that while Jake is in [...] "a desperate state" [...] he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual {{relationship with}} a pupil. Nancy is [...] "incensed", and Fox explained that this revelation is the [...] "final straw" [...] for Nancy who declares the marriage is over as this admission [...] "really shows Jake’s true colours" [...] to her. Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: [...] "We've tried really hard to make sure that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her. That's something that really annoys me in soap, when something really dramatic happens to a character and they forget about it a couple of weeks later".|$|E

Historically, in the Australian case, it was a system that covered its own tracks and left few marks apart from those it left on the lives of its victims.
