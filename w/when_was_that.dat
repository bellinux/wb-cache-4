[...] Norah's secret misgivings on her sister's account {{rendered}} her more than usually serious and uncommunicative, as the year advanced. Even Mr. Vanstone, when July drew nearer, lost something of his elasticity of spirit. He kept up appearances in his wife's presence--but on all other occasions there was now a perceptible shade of sadness in his look and manner. Magdalen was so changed since Frank's departure that she helped the general depression, instead of relieving it. All her movements had grown languid; all her usual occupations were pursued with the same weary indifference; she spent hours alone in her own room; she lost her interest in being brightly and prettily dressed; her eyes were heavy, her nerves were irritable, her complexion was altered visibly for the worse--in one word, she had become an oppression and a weariness to herself and to all about her. Stoutly as Miss Garth contended with these growing domestic difficulties, her own spirits suffered in the effort. Her memory reverted, oftener and oftener, to the March morning when the master and mistress of the house had departed for London, and then the first serious change, for many a year past, had stolen over the family atmosphere. <b>When</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> atmosphere to be clear again?

60|$|His {{striking}} out such a provision, {{if there was}} such a one in the bill, he argues, does not establish the proof that it was stricken out for the purpose of robbing the people of that right. I would say, in the first place, that that would be a most manifest reason for it. It is true, as Judge Douglas states, that many Territorial bills have passed without having such a provision in them. I believe it is true, though I am not certain, that in some instances constitutions framed under such bills have been submitted to a vote of the people with the law silent upon the subject; but it does not appear that they once had their enabling acts framed with an express provision for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people, then that they were stricken out when Congress did not mean to alter the effect of the law. That there have been bills which never had the provision in, I do not question; but <b>when</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> provision taken out of one that it was in? More especially does the evidence tend to prove the proposition that Trumbull advanced, when we remember that the provision was stricken out of the bill almost simultaneously with the time that Bigler says there was a conference among certain senators, and in which it was agreed that a bill should be passed leaving that out. Judge Douglas, in answering Trumbull, omits to attend to the testimony of Bigler, that there was a meeting in which it was agreed they should so frame the bill {{that there should be no}} submission of the constitution to a vote of the people. The Judge does not notice this part of it. If you take this as one piece of evidence, and then ascertain that simultaneously Judge Douglas struck out a provision that did require it to be submitted, and put the two together, I think it will make a pretty fair show of proof that Judge Douglas did, as Trumbull says, enter into a plot to put in force a constitution for Kansas, without giving the people any opportunity of voting upon it.|$|E
6000|$|Looking {{back from}} our standing-point of to-day, {{we know how}} great Rome was--infinitely greater, as far as power is concerned, than {{anything}} else which the world has produced. It came to pass that [...] "Urbis et orbis" [...] was not a false boast. Gradually growing from the little nest of robbers established {{on the banks of}} the Tiber, the people of Rome learned how to spread their arms over all the known world, and to conquer and rule, while they drew to themselves all that the ingenuity and industry of other people had produced. To do this, there must have been not only courage and persistence, but intelligence, patriotism, and superior excellence in that art of combination of which government consists. But yet, when we look back, it is hard to say when were the palmy days of Rome. When did those virtues shine by which her power was founded? <b>When</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> wisdom best exhibited from which came her capacity for ruling? Not in the time of her early kings, whose mythic virtues, if they existed, were concerned but in small matters; for the Rome of the kings claimed a jurisdiction extending as yet but a few miles from the city. And from the time of their expulsion, Rome, though she was rising in power, was rising slowly, and through such difficulties that the reader of history, did he not know the future, would think from time to time that the day of her destruction had come upon her. Not when Brennus was at Rome with his Gauls, a hundred and twenty-five years after the expulsion of the kings, could Rome be said to have been great; nor when, fifty or sixty years afterward, the Roman army--the only army which Rome then possessed--had to lay down its arms in the Caudine Forks and pass under the Samnite yoke. Then, when the Samnite wars were ended, and Rome was mistress in Italy--mistress, after all, of no more than Southern Italy--the Punic wars began. It could hardly have been during that long contest with Carthage, which was carried on for nearly fifty years, that the palmy days of Rome were at their best. Hannibal seems always to be the master. Trebia, Thrasymene and Cannæ, year after year, threaten complete destruction to the State. Then comes the great Scipio; and no doubt, if we must mark an era of Roman greatness, it would be that of the battle of Zama and the submission of Carthage, 201 years before Christ. But with Scipio there springs up the idea of personal ambition; and in the Macedonian and Greek wars that follow, though the arm of Rome is becoming stronger every day, and her shoulders broader, there is already the glamour of her decline in virtue. Her dealings with Antiochus, with Pyrrhus, and with the Achæans, though successful, were hardly glorious. Then came the two Gracchi, and the reader begins to doubt whether the glory of the Republic is not already over. They demanded impossible reforms, by means as illegal as they were impossible, and were both killed in popular riots. The war with Jugurtha followed, in which the Romans were for years unsuccessful, and during which German hordes from the north rushed into Gaul and destroyed an army of 80,000 Romans. This brings us to Marius and to Sulla, of whom we have already spoken, and to that period of Roman politics which the German historian describes as being open to no judgment [...] "save one of inexorable and remorseless condemnation." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maggie, {{all this}} time, moved about with a {{quiescence}} and even torpor of manner, so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor, that Lucy {{would have had}} to seek some other cause for such a change, if she had not been convinced that the position in which Maggie stood between Philip and her brother, and the prospect of her self-imposed wearisome banishment, were quite enough to account for a large amount of depression. But under this torpor there was a fierce battle of emotions, such as Maggie in all her life of struggle had never known or foreboded; it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in ambush till now, and had suddenly started up full-armed, with hideous, overpowering strength! There were moments in which a cruel selfishness seemed to be getting possession of her; why should not Lucy, why should not Philip, suffer? She had had to suffer through many years of her life; and who had renounced anything for her? And when something like that fulness of existence--love, wealth, ease, refinement, all that her nature craved--was brought within her reach, why was she to forego it, that another might have it,--another, who perhaps needed it less? But amidst all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making themselves heard with rising power, till, from time to time, the tumult seemed quelled. Was that existence which tempted her the full existence she dreamed? Where, then, would be all the memories of early striving; all the deep pity for another's pain, which had been nurtured in her through years of affection and hardship; all the divine presentiment of something higher than mere personal enjoyment, which had made the sacredness of life? She might as well hope to enjoy walking by maiming her feet, as hope to enjoy an existence in which she set out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs of her soul. And then, if pain were so hard to her, what was it to others? [...] "Ah, God! preserve me from inflicting--give me strength to bear it." [...] How had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she would once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate crime? <b>When</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, {{as if it had been}} a loathsome thing? And yet, since this strange, sweet, subduing influence did not, should not, conquer her,--since it was to remain simply her own suffering,--her mind was meeting Stephen's in that thought of his, that they might still snatch moments of mute confession before the parting came. For was not he suffering too? She saw it daily--saw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which, as soon as he was not compelled to exert himself, he relapsed into indifference toward everything but the possibility of watching her. Could she refuse sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her like a low murmur of love and pain? She refused it less and less, till at last the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment's mutual gaze; they thought of it till it came, and when it had come, they thought of nothing else.|$|E

6000|$|Poor Alvina, {{this was}} the only day in all her life when she was the centre of public attention. For once, every eye was upon her, every mind was {{thinking}} about her. Poor Alvina! said every member of the Woodhouse [...] "middle class": Poor Alvina Houghton, said every collier's wife. Poor thing, left alone--and hardly a penny to bless herself with. Lucky if she's not left with a pile of debts. James Houghton ran through some money in his day. Ay, if she had her rights she'd be a rich woman. Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her. Ay, but James sank it all in Throttle-Ha'penny and Klondyke and the Endeavour. Well, he was his own worst enemy. He paid his way. I'm not so sure about that. Look how he served his wife, and now Alvina. I'm not so sure he was his own worst enemy. He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood. Ah well, he'll spend no more money, anyhow. No, he went sudden, didn't he? But he was getting very frail, if you noticed. Oh yes, why he fair seemed to totter down to Lumley. Do you reckon as that place pays its way? What, the Endeavour?--they say it does. They say it makes a nice bit. Well, it's mostly pretty full. Ay, it is. Perhaps it won't be now Mr. Houghton's gone. Perhaps not. I wonder if he will leave much. I'm sure he won't. Everything he's got's mortgaged up to the hilt. He'll leave debts, you see if he doesn't. What is she going to do then? She'll have to go out of Manchester House--her and Miss Pinnegar. Wonder what she'll do. Perhaps she'll take up that nursing. She never made much of that, did she--and spent a sight of money on her training, they say. She's a bit like her father in the business line--all flukes. Pity some nice young man doesn't turn up and marry her. I don't know, she doesn't seem to hook on, does she? Why she's never had a proper boy. They make out she was engaged once. Ay, but nobody ever saw him, and it was off {{as soon as it was}} on. Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit. Did she? No, I never knew. <b>When</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> Why, when he was at Oxford, you know, learning for his head master's place. Why didn't she marry him then? Perhaps he never asked her. Ay, there's that to it. She'd have looked down her nose at him, times gone by. Ay, but that's all over, my boy. She'd snap at anybody now. Look how she carries on with that manager. Why, that's something awful. Haven't you ever watched her in the Cinema? She never lets him alone. And it's anybody alike. Oh, she doesn't respect herself. I don't consider. No girl who respected herself would go on as she does, throwing herself at every feller's head. Does she, though? Ay, any performer or anybody. She's a tidy age, though. She's not much chance of getting off. How old do you reckon she is? Must be well over thirty. You never say. Well, she looks it. She does beguy--a dragged old maid. Oh but she sprightles up a bit sometimes. Ay, when she thinks she's hooked on to somebody. I wonder why she never did take? It's funny. Oh, she was too high and mighty before, and now it's too late. Nobody wants her. And she's got no relations to go to either, has she? No, that's her father's cousin who she's walking with. Look, they're coming. He's a fine-looking man, isn't he? You'd have thought they'd have buried Miss Frost beside Mrs. Houghton. You would, wouldn't you? I should think Alvina will lie by Miss Frost. They say the grave was made for both of them. Ay, she was a lot more of a mother to her than her own mother. She was good to them, Miss Frost was. Alvina thought the world of her. That's her stone--look, down there. Not a very grand one, considering. No, it isn't. Look, there's room for Alvina's name underneath. Sh!-- ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this PhD {{research}} {{is the study of}} the underlying processes of evolutionary changes that lead to biological diversity. Such processes include those operating within and between populations (population divergence), as well as those operating among species (speciation), above the species level (e. g. genera and families) and the mechanisms that promote these divisions. Fundamental to these processes are the effects of genetic, demographic, geographical, ecological, behavioural and environmental factors on diversification. Rails (Aves: Rallidae) are used as an example to address central questions related to how these biological entities originated, <b>when</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> biological diversity generated, and why this biodiversity is distributed as it is. This thesis has been divided into four main chapters/papers for convenience to achieve this aim. In the first chapter, complete mitochondrial genomes and fossil data are used to provide a likely estimated time of rail ecology. I estimated that the origin and diversification of crown group Rallidae was during the Eocene about 40. 5 (49 – 33) Mya with evidence of intrafamiliar diversification from Late Eocene to Miocene time. This time is much older than currently available fossils assigned to Rallidae, but more direct evidence of fossils with reasonable taxonomy are likely to emerge. This estimated time implies that rail diversity originated deep in the avian tree supporting an inference of deep ancestry of terrestrial/walking habits among Neoaves. In addition, in the second chapter I used neutral molecular data (nuclear and mitochondrial gene fragments) to reveal the degree of historical biogeographic signal and net diversification in the current lineage distribution using the most complete species-level hypothesis for ralloids. This comprehensive intrafamiliar molecular phylogeny allowed to infer spatial and ecological diversification in Rallidae associated with morphological innovation (frontal shield, body size and flightlessness) and the global retention of diversity in several lineages caused by dispersal, adaptation and exploitation of ecological opportunities. In the third and fourth chapters I explored historical patterns of diversification in a biogeographic context (in spatial and temporal scales) within a clade (Porphyrio but focused on the type species Porphyrio porphyrio) and a highly polymorphic species (Gallirallus philippensis). In the third chapter, a dated phylogeny and the tools of population genetics were used to gain insights into the congeneric relationships, diversification, and the history of expansion {{of one of the most}} peculiar clades within Rallidae. I found that the Porphyrio clade arose during the Mid-Miocene, apparently in Africa, with a single Long-Distance Dispersal (LDD) event occurring into the Americas and several other LDD events to the North-East around 10 Mya. Porphyrio porphyrio was not found to be a natural group with P. melanotus appearing in Australasia during the Pleistocene (600 kya). Dispersal, isolation, adaptation and selective pressure accounted for most of the variation found within this clade. On a finer scale, the fourth chapter explored genetic changes within populations of the supertramp and great speciator Gallirallus philippensis using a mitochondrial DNA marker to recognise the genetic changes caused by founder events and provide important insights into the microevolutionary processes that drove the early stages of diversification. This study found that abrupt genetic changes of founder events are related to dispersal, colonisation, range expansion, gene flow, isolation and strong selection forces. The consequences of such processes for speciation and how they affected the population demography and evolutionary history of Gallirallus philippensis in the south western Pacific are discussed. These independent but linked studies within this thesis yield important clues to the evolutionary history that has shaped the diversity of rails. This research contributes to our understanding of Tertiary vertebrate evolution and establishes a bridge between macro– and micro–evolution.
