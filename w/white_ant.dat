5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the <b>White</b> <b>Ant</b> (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Stage 2 of {{the program}} began with the first {{building}} (a 180-seat lecture theatre) completed in early 2001. The Schofield block became part {{of the program}} in 2002 after the building was damaged by fires. During the next two years the old Technology Block and the Francis block were demolished due to a <b>white</b> <b>ant</b> infestation, with both blocks being rebuilt and refurnished in 2004. The final stage of the works were underway {{at the time of the}} departure of Principal Michael Quinlan, who retired in 2006 after having been Principal since 1992. These developments (including a new music block) continued with the guidance of the new principal, Ms Larissa Treskin.|$|E
25|$|These {{conditions}} are particularly {{characteristic of the}} northern regions; in the south the vegetation on the uplands is more luxuriant. Among the many varieties of trees and plants found are the date palm, mimosa, wild olive, giant sycamores, junipers and laurels, the myrrh and other gum trees (gnarled and stunted, these flourish most on the eastern foothills), a magnificent pine (the Natal yellow pine, which resists the attacks of the <b>white</b> <b>ant),</b> the fig, orange, lime, pomegranate, peach, apricot, banana, and other fruit trees; the grape vine (rare), blackberry, and raspberry; the cotton and indigo Plants, and occasionally the sugar cane. There are in the south large forests of valuable timber trees; and the coffee plant is indigenous in the Kaffa country, whence it takes its name.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the leader}} of the Second Afrikaans Language Movement, Marais {{preferred}} to write in Afrikaans, and his work was translated into various languages either late in his life or after his death. His book Die Siel van die Mier (The Soul of the Ant but usually given in English as the Soul of the <b>White</b> <b>Ant)</b> was plagiarised by Nobel laureate Maurice Maeterlinck, who published La Vie des Termites (translated into English as The Life of Termites or The Life of [...] White Ants), an entomological book, in what has been called [...] "a classic example of academic plagiarism" [...] by University of London's professor of biology, David Bignell.|$|E

2500|$|Marais accused Maeterlinck {{of having}} used {{his concept of}} the [...] "organic unity" [...] of the termitary in his book. Marais had {{published}} his ideas on the termitary in the South African Afrikaans-language press, both in Die Burger in January 1923 and in Huisgenoot, which featured {{a series of articles}} on termites under the title [...] "Die Siel van die Mier" [...] (The Soul of the (<b>White)</b> <b>Ant)</b> from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is alleged that Maeterlinck had come across Eugene Marais' series of articles, and {{that it would have been}} easy for Maeterlinck to translate from Afrikaans to French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French before. It was common at the time for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.|$|E

Indeed, when I told him that my spies {{said that you were}} to ride with the Boers, as I had requested that you should be their Tongue, he answered that unless I promised to give you to the vultures, he would warn them against coming. So, since I wanted them to come as I had arranged with him, I promised." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{think it}} was that unlucky joke of mine which first set Mameena thinking, [...] "like a <b>white</b> <b>ant</b> in its tunnel," [...] as Saduko said. At least, after it her manner towards me changed; she became very deferential; she listened to my words {{as though they were}} all wisdom; I caught her looking at me with her soft eyes as though I were quite an admirable object. She began to talk to me of her difficulties, her {{troubles}} and her ambitions. She asked me for my advice as to Saduko. On this point I replied to her that, if she loved him, and her father would allow it, presumably she had better marry him.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ah!' she said, and, my father, {{her eyes}} flashed. 'Ah! Chaka! There was a man! Be another Chaka, Saduko, and I will love you more--more {{than you can}} dream of--thus and thus,' and she flung her arms about me and kissed me as I was never kissed before, which, as you know, among us is a strange thing for a girl to do. Then she thrust me from her with a laugh, and added: 'As for the waiting, you must ask my father of that. Am I not his heifer, to be sold, and can I disobey my father?' And she was gone, leaving me empty, for {{it seemed as though}} she took my vitals with her. Nor will she talk thus any more, the <b>white</b> <b>ant</b> who has gone back into its tunnel." ...|$|E
60|$|Ascending again, {{the path}} strikes up the hill, through a thick forest of Sal (Vateria robusta) and other trees, spanned with cables of scandent Bauhinia stems. At about 3000 {{feet above the}} sea, the {{vegetation}} becomes more luxuriant, and by a little stream I collected five species of ferns and some mosses,--all in a dry state, however. Still higher, Clematis, Thalictrum, and an increased number of grasses are seen; with bushes of Verbenaceae and Compositae. The <b>white</b> <b>ant</b> apparently does not enter this cooler region. At 3500 feet the vegetation again changes, the trees all become gnarled and scattered; and as the dampness also increases, more mosses and ferns appear. We emerged from the forest {{at the foot of}} the great ridge of rocky peaks, stretching E. and W. three or four miles. Abundance of a species of berberry and an Osbeckia marked the change in the vegetation most decidedly, and were frequent over the whole summit, with coarse grasses, and various bushes.|$|E

60|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} {{that there should}} be no visitors to-day; only a nephew and a foreign consul-general, just to break the formality of the meeting. Mr. Neuchatel placed Myra next to himself at the round table, and treated her with marked consideration--cordial but courteous, and easy, with a certain degree of deference. His wife, who piqued herself on her perception of character, threw her brown velvet eyes on her neighbour, Mr. Penruddock, and cross-examined him in mystical whispers. She soon recognised his love of nature; and this allowed her to dissert on the subject, at once sublime and inexhaustible, with copiousness worthy of the theme. When she found he was an entomologist, and that it was not so much mountains as insects which interested him, she shifted her ground, but treated it with equal felicity. Strange, but nature is never so powerful as in insect life. The <b>white</b> <b>ant</b> can destroy fleets and cities, and the locusts erase a province. And then, how beneficent they are! Man would find it difficult to rival their exploits: the bee, that gives us honey; the worm, that gives us silk; the cochineal, that supplies our manufactures with their most brilliant dye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Standing thus, Solomon died; but the Jinns did {{not know}} it, and their toil and labor continued, by night and by day. Now, {{according}} to the tradition, a little <b>white</b> <b>ant,</b> one of the kind which devours wood, came {{up out of the}} earth on the very day on which Solomon died, and began to gnaw the inside of his staff. She gnawed a little every day, until at last the staff became hollow {{from one end to the}} other; and on the day when she finished her work, the work of the Jinns was also finished. Then the staff crumbled, and the dead Solomon fell, face foremost, to the earth. The Jinns, perceiving that they had been slaving day and night for a master who was dead, fled away with yells of rage and vexation. But the glorious temple was finished, and King Solomon's work was done. Tabari tells this story, and it is also found in the Koran; but the origin of it was nothing more than the well-known custom of Solomon to exercise personal supervision over those who were working for him.|$|E
6000|$|This {{by way of}} parenthesis. My {{next step}} was to request the {{pleasure}} of a visit from Messrs. Hogg and Kirkwood, who were in charge of the English factories at Glass Town and Olomi; they came down stream at once, and kindly acted as ciceroni around Le Plateau. The landing is good; a reef has been converted into a jetty and little breakwater; behind this segment of a circle we disembarked without any danger of being washed out of the boat, as at S'a Leone, Cape Coast Castle, and Accra. Unfortunately just above this pier there is a Dutch-like jardin d'été--beds of dirty weeds bordering a foul and stagnant swamp, while below the settlement appears a huge coal-shed: the expensive mineral is always dangerous when exposed in the tropics, and some thirty per cent. would be saved by sending out a hulk.
