40|$|Bali {{is a small}} {{beautiful}} tropical {{island of}} Indonesia archipelago lies betweens the continent of Asia and Australia {{as well as the}} Indian and Pacific Ocean. As a tropical archipelago, of course, many kinds of biodiversity can be found over there. In the island of Bali in particular, there are typical animal diversity that could not be investigated beyond such island, such as, Bali cattle, Bali dog, Bali <b>white</b> <b>starling</b> and others. As time goes on, the existance of such biodiversity decreases in both quality and quantity. Both global warming/climate change and land use change are the main factors affecting such phenomenon. This study has been conducted by employing field observation as well as literature study. It was found that, the quality of purebred Bali cattle species decreases genetically that could be notified of smaller bodysize for both male and female. Land use change of agriculture activity to the hotels, house of living, roads and other infrastructures are the main factors for Bali cattle existancy. For typical famous bird of <b>white</b> <b>starling,</b> the problem is because of deforestation which cause natural habitat loss, due to land use change for agricultural activity and house building by local people. In case of Bali dog, the mad dog of rabies is just introduce and spreading over Bali island, whichis formerly the island of Bali has been recognised as free zone area of the rabies. As consequency, suffering dogs must be eliminated by a mass killing cause decrease total number of such poor dog. Overall, it could be concluded that environmental degradations of land use change, deforestation and desease are the main causes of biodiversity decreasing number of the Bali cattle, Bali <b>white</b> <b>starling</b> and Bali dog respectively, beside global warming/climate change natural disaster...|$|E
5000|$|The mammals {{include several}} species of native bats, {{including}} the Samoa flying fox and insular flying fox. The avifauna includes 65 species of bird where the more unusual distinctive ones are the blue-crowned lorikeet, the spotless crake, the many-coloured fruit dove, the wattled honeyeater, tropical pigeons, the samoan <b>starling,</b> <b>white</b> tern, black noddy and the red-tailed tropicbird.|$|R
50|$|Roost sizes tend to {{fluctuate}} seasonally, with species like the <b>starling,</b> <b>white</b> wagtail, chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), brambling (Fringilla montifringilla), and the icterids (Icteridea family) forming large groups during the winter. This increased group size {{is believed to}} increase the ability to gain and distribute food knowledge {{as a result of}} an environmental situation that creates the greatest need for the members to search and share information. Similar to advertisement and synchronized breeding and to reiterate the role of ICH, this behavior also improves food searching capabilities and information exchange and may have been an advantageous behavior that evolved.|$|R
50|$|Three {{types of}} migratory birds are regular {{visitors}} to Punjab’s provincial metropolis. These are winter visitors, summer visitors and transit migrants. The winter visitors come in September and stay until May. They come from northern latitudes and higher altitudes and include yellow-browed warbler, common <b>starling,</b> <b>white</b> wagtail, yellow wagtail and white-browed wagtail {{in search of}} food. The wagtails eat small insects, spiders, mollusks and soft seeds from moist soil. They roost in tall Typha and reed growth {{on the banks of}} ponds and lakes. Summer visitors arrive from southern parts of the country; these include Asian koel, purple sunbird, golden oriole and cuckoos. They also come here in search of food and for breeding. They stay in urban Lahore from March until September.|$|R
40|$|In the nesting season 2015, the {{differences}} between abundances of 11 selected synanthropic species were monitored in village housing development and agricultural buildings {{on both sides of}} Czech-Austrian border in the area of Třeboň and in the Gmünd district. There were 20 municipalities chosen for this research, from whom half were in the Czech Republic and the other half in Austria. Two squares 100 x 100 m were demarcated in each village, of which one was situated mostly in the residential and the other in the agricultural area. The monitored species were house sparrow, Eurasian tree sparrow, Eurasian collared dove, European greenfinch, European serin, black redstart, European goldfinch, common linnet, common <b>starling,</b> <b>white</b> wagtail and common chaffinch. Other factors, such as poultry breeding, coverage of greenery (of herb layer, bushes and trees), the proportion of old and new housing development, etc. were monitored as well. The number of identified species in the square and also their total abundance were significantly higher in the Czech Republic. Regarding individual species, the most noticeable difference in abundance was observed with Eurasian tree sparrow (in the Czech Republic 151 individuals, in Austria 37 individuals), followed by house sparrow (in the Czech Republic 217 individuals, in Austria 123 individuals). Significant difference was also proved with Eurasian collared dove. The most numerous detected species were in general both kinds of sparrow. Furthermore, the abundance of detected species was compared also between residential building areas in the centre of a village and the agricultural buildings on its outskirts. Significant difference was observed only with house sparrow and Eurasian collared dove, both species preferred the centre of a village, {{on both sides of the}} border. For the house sparrow he was also a statistically significant difference in the density of development in the monitored squares on the numbers in the Czech Republic. In Austria, a significant difference in percentual representation of tree and shrub layer in the monitored squares on abundance...|$|R
40|$|Indian subcontinent plays host to {{a number}} of migratory birds in summers as well as winters. It is {{estimated}} that over hundred species of migratory birds fly to India, either in search of feeding grounds or to escape the severe winter of their native habitat. Sandi bird sanctuary was created in 1990 in order to protect and conserve the natural habitation and surroundings and also the marine vegetation for the migratory birds, {{as well as for the}} local people of the region. The term migration is used to describe movements of populations of birds or other animals. There are three types of migrants. One way to look at migration is to consider the distances traveled. The pattern of migration can vary within each category, but is most variable in short and medium distance migrants. The origin of migration is related to the distance traveled. The birds migrating through the area, take shelter on the river front before going to the Sandi Bird sanctuary. The birds generally migrate in the winter months of October-November-December. Bird sanctuary is a popular tourist location. Sandi particularly attracts ornithologists and bird watchers, as many rare migratory birds take refuge in the sanctuary. The bird watching camps arranged to observe the migratory birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary in the month of October and November 2012. The migratory birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary include great crested grebe, white storks, black lbis, glossy lbis, spoonbill, ruddy shelduck, pin tail, sholveller, spot bill duck, mallard, gadwall, wigeon, tufted pochard, gargancey teal, common teal, cotton teal, grey lag goose, coot, black tailed godwit, painted stock pin tail snipe, marsh sand piper, common tern, river tern, magpie robin, white wagtail, pied wagtail, common snipe, <b>starlings,</b> <b>white</b> lbis, red crested pochard, common pochard, painted stock, black lbis, curlew, Indian skimmer etc. The resident birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary include little grebe, darter, purple heron, grey heron, pond heron, night heron, large, medium and little egrets, painted stork, open billed stork, cattle egret, black necked stork(endangered), combduck, lesser whistling teal, common pariah kite, brahminy kite, shikra, sparrow, hawk, tawny eagle, greater spotted eagle, crested hawk eagle, lagger falcon rain quail, jungle bush quail, painted bush quail, black partridge, grey partridge, common peafowl, water hens, purple moor hens, jacanas, black winged stilt, lap wing, blue rock pigeon, dove spp., parakeets, crow pheasants, owl, swifts, kingfishers, blue jay, hoopoe, mynas, crow, drongo, bulbul, babblers, cormorants, sarus cranes, etc. There are 38195 local birds and 11378 migratory birds (total 49572) observed during period of study. The migratory birds represent the economic importance of that particular area and faunal biodiversity along with health of ecosystem...|$|R
