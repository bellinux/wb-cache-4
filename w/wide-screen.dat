5|$|Mr. Nobody was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on 21 July 2010, through Pathé, in two formats: a single-disc <b>wide-screen</b> version which special features include a trailer, making-of and a photo gallery; and a two-disc <b>wide-screen</b> special edition. The latter contains the director's cut of the film which has 1 re-cut, 23 extended scenes and 12 additional scenes integrated into the original footage, running about 16 minutes longer than the theatrical version. The Warner Home Video Dutch release includes new specials features: interactive menu, scene access, a making-of, a behind the scenes, deleted scenes and a photo gallery. On 11 January 2011, it {{was released}} in Canada through Entertainment One on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, with a making-of featurette, behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes. Optimum Home Entertainment released Mr. Nobody to the British market on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 12 September 2011, with few special features. It contains a making-of with Leto interview and a trailer of the film.|$|E
5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and <b>wide-screen</b> televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E

40|$|G-quadruplexes form in guanine-rich {{regions of}} DNA and the {{presence}} of these structures at telomeres prevents the activity of telomerase in vitro. Ligands such as the cationic porphyrin TMPyP 4 stabilise G-quadruplexes and are therefore under investigation for their potential use as anti-cancer drugs. In order to investigate the mechanism of action of TMPyP 4 in vivo, we carried out a genome-wide screen in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that deletion of key pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) genes increased the sensitivity of yeast to the presence of TMPyP 4. The PPP {{plays an important role in}} the oxidative stress response and sensitivity to TMPyP 4 also increased when genes involved in the oxidative stress response, CCS 1 and YAP 1, were deleted. For comparison we also report genome <b>wide-screens</b> using hydrogen peroxide, which causes oxidative stress, RHPS 4, another G-quadruplex binder and hydroxyurea, an S phase poison. We found that a number of TMPyP 4 -sensitive strains are also sensitive to hydrogen peroxide in a genome-wide screen. Overall our results suggest that treatment with TMPyP 4 results in light-dependent oxidative stress response in budding yeast, and that this, rather than G-quadruplex binding, is the major route to cytotoxicity. Our results have implications for the usefulness and mechanism of action of TMPyP 4...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{epidemiology}} {{has undergone}} marked development since the 1950 s. One {{of the most}} spectacular and specific contributions was the demonstration of the massive effect of smoking on the occurrence of lung, larynx, and bladder cancer. Major chemical, physical, and biological carcinogenic agents have been identified in the working environment and in the overall environment. The chain of events from environmental exposures to cancer requires hundreds of polymorphic genes coding for proteins involved in the transport and metabolism of xenobiotics, or in repair, or in an immune or inflammatory response. The multifactorial and multistage characteristics of cancer create the theoretical conditions for statistical interactions that have been exceptionally detected. Over the last two decades, a considerable mass of data has been generated, mostly addressing the interactions between smoking and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in smoking-related cancers. They were sometimes considered disappointing, but they actually brought a lot of information and raised many methodological issues. In parallel, the number of polymorphisms that can be considered candidate per function increased so much that multiple testing has become a major issue, and genome <b>wide-screening</b> approaches have more and more gained in interest. Facing the resulting complexity, some instruments are being set up: our studies are now equipped with carefully sampled biological collections, high-throughput genotyping systems are becoming available, work on statistical methodologies is ongoing, bioinformatics databases are growing larger and access to them is becoming simpler; international consortiums are being organized. The roles of environmental and genetic factors are being jointly elucidated. The basic rules of epidemiology, which are demanding with respect to sampling, with respect to the histological and molecular criteria for cancer classification, with respect to the evaluation of environmental exposures, their timeframes, quantification and covariables, with respect to study size and with respect to the rigor of multivariate analyses, are more pertinent than ever before.

25|$|Fair City's {{original}} opening sequence {{was designed}} by Carol Coffey. The second opening sequence was introduced in 1995 when the then executive producer John Lynch decided that the opening needed modernising. It {{was designed by}} John Hayes in collaboration with John Lynch. For 10 years, the opening remained unchanged, aside from the digital insertion of the Millennium Bridge. In order to be compatible with <b>wide-screen</b> format and show {{the changing face of}} Dublin, a new opening, designed by Michael McKeon, was introduced in 2005. The present opening, designed by Paul Gibney, was introduced in 2008.|$|E
25|$|A DVD was {{released}} by MGM Home Entertainment on December 2, 2003. The DVD contains a new restored <b>wide-screen</b> transfer, an audio commentary featuring director Friedkin where he relates stories about {{the making of the}} movie, a half-hour documentary featuring the main characters, a deleted scene showing a distraught Vukovich bothering his soon-to-be ex-wife at her apartment, and the alternate ending Friedkin refused to use, in which the two Secret Service partners survive but are transferred to Alaska while their supervisor Bateman is promoted and takes credit for stopping Masters. On February 2, 2010, the film {{was released}} on Blu-ray not containing all of the previous special features that were included on the DVD release.|$|E
25|$|Determining {{that its}} Evo {{platform}} lacked the horsepower to produce satisfying video games, Bally re-engineered its entire line of video and reel-spinning slot machines. Alpha, its new platform based on Sierra's operating system, dramatically improved Bally's entire portfolio of games, {{leading to the}} release of Hot Shot Progressives, a new series of video and reel machines. Overtaking the Blazing 7s line, Hot Shot Progressives quickly became the company's biggest seller and the most successful product launch in the company's history. Bally also introduced several new gaming platforms, including the V20 upright, the dual-screen V20/20 video slot, the S9E reel-spinner and the CineVision <b>wide-screen</b> video gaming device. As of July, 2009, more than 550 casinos worldwide utilize Bally systems products running on more than 400,000 slot machines.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, he also {{released}} his only short-form documentary: Made in Milan about fashion designer Giorgio Armani. The following year brought Cape Fear, {{a remake of}} a cult 1962 movie {{of the same name}} and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter (1955). Cape Fear received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting misogynistic violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until The Aviator (2004), and then The Departed (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used <b>wide-screen</b> Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.|$|E
500|$|V for Vendetta was {{released}} on DVD in the US on August 1, 2006, in three formats: a single-disc <b>wide-screen</b> version, a single-disc full-screen version, and a two-disc <b>wide-screen</b> special edition. DVD sales were successful, selling 1,412,865 DVD units {{in the first week}} of release which translated to $27,683,818 in revenue. By the end of 2006, 3,086,073 DVD units had been sold, bringing in slightly more than its production cost of $58,342,597. The single disc versions contain a short (15:56) behind-the-scenes featurette titled [...] "Freedom! Forever! Making V for Vendetta" [...] and the film's theatrical trailer, whereas the two-disc special edition contains three additional documentaries, and several extra features for collectors. On the second disc of the special edition, a short Easter egg clip of Natalie Portman on Saturday Night Live can be viewed by selecting the picture of wings on the second page of the menu. The film has also been released on the HD DVD high definition format, which features a unique 'in-film experience' created exclusively for the disc. Warner Bros. later released the video on Blu-Ray, on May 20, 2008. The film also saw release on Sony's PSP UMD format.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin {{remained}} a controversial figure throughout the 1950s, especially {{after he was}} awarded the International Peace Prize by the communist-led World Peace Council, and after his meetings with Zhou Enlai and Nikita Khrushchev. He began developing his first European film, A King in New York, in 1954. Casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States, Chaplin included several of his recent experiences in the screenplay. His son, Michael, was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI, while Chaplin's character faces accusations of communism. The political satire parodied HUAC and attacked elements of 1950s culture – including consumerism, plastic surgery, and <b>wide-screen</b> cinema. In a review, the playwright John Osborne called it Chaplin's [...] "most bitter" [...] and [...] "most openly personal" [...] film.|$|E
500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series". As Bond walks across the screen, he is viewed by the audience through {{the barrel of a}} gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the <b>wide-screen</b> Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the [...] "James Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, {{for a new}} experience in a Resident Evil game. Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued. The decision to retain <b>wide-screen</b> proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly {{on top of the}} second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely. Takeuchi cited the film Black Hawk Down as an influence on the setting of [...] Resident Evil 5 and his experience working on Lost Planet: Extreme Condition as an influence on its development. When questioned as to why the game was not being released on the Wii, which was the most popular gaming console at the time, Takeuchi responded that although that may have been a good decision [...] "from a business perspective", the Wii was not the best choice in terms of power and visual quality, concluding that he was happy with the console choices they had made.|$|E

Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "a thousand YouTube bedroom dancers flood the Internet with their own takes" [...] were {{to come in the}} near future. Rolling Stone praised Beyoncé's dance moves and wrote that it is the latest addition [...] "to the canon of dance pop videos with over-the-top apocalyptic imagery". Nick Neyland of Prefix Magazine wrote Beyoncé made the best music video of 2011, commending its [...] "big budget extravagance, full of preposterous costumes and ridiculously over the top dance routines". Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post wrote that Beyoncé uses [...] "the non-violent tactic of dance to fight off some bad guys in riot gear" [...] and that Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce [...] "is out in full force as she uses an army of swiveling and shimmying women, her middle finger and two hyenas on leashes to keep control of a post-apocalyptic society". Billboard magazine wrote that Beyoncé made a triumphant return in the elaborate music video for [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] after creating classic clips for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", [...] "Crazy in Love", and [...] "Ring the Alarm".|$|E

[...] Musically, he opined the singer is [...] "going for adult dystopian synth-pop realness." [...] For The Observer, Kitty Empire noted Halsey's [...] "generic guest spot {{on a massive}} 2016 hit by The Chainsmokers, 'Closer', was an omen" [...] as the album [...] "does succumb to post-hit syndrome.

All episodes were filmed in [...] <b>wide-screen,</b> although Stargate SG-1 was broadcast in [...] aspect ratio in its first years. The transition to the broadcast of episodes in the wider 16:9 ratio gave directors more freedom in frame composition. The first three seasons of Stargate SG-1 were filmed on 16mm film, notwithstanding scenes involving visual effects that had always been shot on 35mm film for various technical reasons. After a test run with the Season 3 finale, [...] "Nemesis", Stargate SG-1 switched to 35mm film for all purposes at the beginning of Season 4. Digital HD cameras were used for filming beginning with Season 8.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the release}} of 1958's Hercules, {{starring}} American bodybuilder Steve Reeves, the Italian film industry gained entree to the American film market. [...] These films, many with mythological or Bible themes, were low-budget costume/adventure dramas, and had immediate appeal with both European and American audiences. [...] Besides the many films starring a variety of muscle men as Hercules, heroes such as Samson and Italian fictional hero Maciste were common. Sometimes dismissed as low-quality escapist fare, the Peplums allowed newer directors such as Sergio Leone and Mario Bava a means of breaking into the film industry. Some, such as Mario Bava's Hercules in the Haunted World (Italian: Ercole Al Centro Della Terra) are considered seminal works in their own right. As the genre matured, budgets sometimes increased, as evidenced in 1962's I sette gladiatori (The Seven Gladiators in 1964 US release), a <b>wide-screen</b> epic with impressive sets and matte-painting work. Most Peplum films were in color, whereas previous Italian efforts had often been black and white.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{praised the}} filmmakers' technique, finding it [...] "superbly shot, with some deadpan, elegant compositions, and {{intentionally}} skewiff framings". Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun-Times) gave the film {{three out of}} four stars. He noted the director's [...] "complete command of visuals and performances. His cinematography is like a series of family photographs of a family with something wrong with it. His dialogue sounds composed entirely of sentences memorized from tourist phrase books." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said [...] "All of the film's purposeful weirdness is conveyed with an unaffected simplicity that recalls the dead-aim haphazard compositions of photographer William Eggleston." [...] He concluded that [...] "as a film, it's pure and singular, but it's not quite fully formed enough to be what one could call truly visionary." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "at times seems as much an exercise in perversity as an examination of it" [...] and [...] "The static <b>wide-screen</b> compositions are beautiful and strange, with the heads and limbs of the characters frequently cropped. The light is gauzy and diffuse, helping to produce an atmosphere that is insistently and not always unpleasantly dreamlike. You might think of paintings by Balthus or maybe Alex Katz, though the implied stories in those pictures are more genuinely evocative and haunting than the actual narrative of Dogtooth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Currents {{appeared}} on several critics' {{lists of the}} best albums of 2015. Q named Currents the year's top album, saying that [...] "Parker added dancefloor pop to their kaleidoscopic sound" [...] while calling it [...] "sonically advanced and filled with great songs". Spin ranked it as the year's fourth-best, calling it the group's [...] "best because its soul actually lies in Motown". The magazine said the album finds Parker [...] "coming to the epiphany {{that no amount of}} pitch- and time-shifting will screw with your perception of reality as much as a lyric that's as direct and true as 'They say people never change but that's bulls**t / They do.'" [...] Mojo also ranked the record as fourth-best of the year. Pitchfork ranked the album as the year's fifth-best, saying, [...] "There's still a bit of Parker's elegant guitar here, but he's mostly rerouted his perfectionistic craftsmanship to synthesizer tones and drum programming." [...] Paste ranked Currents at number eight on its list of the year's best albums, calling it a [...] "near-perfect album" [...] and [...] "a superb progression from their last efforts, a study in internal consistency." [...] Rolling Stone placed the album at number 13 on its list of the [...] "50 Best Albums of 2015", writing that Parker's [...] "musical rethink... is expansive, resulting in <b>wide-screen</b> adventures like 'Let It Happen'" [...] and that the record is [...] "full of weightless vocals and synthesized funk, for a set that's both blissed-out and mournful, like a set of diary entries from an astronaut floating off into oblivion". The album was also ranked fifth-best of the year by Consequence of Sound and NME, 15th-best by Stereogum, and 22nd-best by PopMatters, while Exclaim! named it the eighth-best pop/rock album of the year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{critically}} acclaimed, receiving an average rating of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on nine reviews. Q magazine regarded the album as [...] "a dramatic, <b>wide-screen,</b> expertly executed, even genuinely thrilling rock record worthy {{of an audience}} way beyond nu-prog's regular constituency." [...] AllMusic, which gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 score, assured that [...] "While there is no [...] "radio single" [...] on the disc most songs transcend their complex structure and feel as provocative as any traditional rock tune". David Fricke from Rolling Stone perceived Porcupine Tree had evolved into [...] "an aggressively modern merger of Rush’s arena art rock, U.K. prog classicism —especially Pink Floyd’s eulogies to madness and King Crimson’s angular majesty— and the post-grunge vengeance of Tool". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune defined the music in the album as [...] "stellar in its serpentine mood-shifting". Sound and Vision praised that [...] "Porcupine Tree is {{at the height of}} its powers" [...] and voted it #3 CD of 2007. Decibel lauded: [...] "Porcupine Tree prove they can play with the best of ’em". The Phoenix newspaper stated [...] "Fear of a Blank Planet is not only their most vintage-sounding album, it’s also their best.", Jim DeRogatis from the Chicago Sun-Times thinks the album is [...] "easily as strong as any of the band's previous eight releases, and the most timely" [...] and Revolver magazine proclaimed [...] "England’s prog princes return at their most limber and conceptually relevant". PopMatters placed it at #5 of [...] "The Best Metal Albums of 2007". Reason magazine chose it as one of the [...] "Best Albums of 2007" [...] though they were more severe than other critics about the lyrical content saying that [...] "Lyrically, it's ridiculous" [...] and [...] "if your grandma was theming a prog rock album, it'd come out something like this". Dan LeRoy from Alternative Press announced it [...] "as heavy as P-Tree have ever been" [...] but [...] "wistfully, sprawlingly melodic as well-sometimes in the same tune" [...] and concluded that [...] "if Wilson's vision of today's kids as overmedicated, overstimulated robots seems like a blatant appeal to the over-30 crowd, it's still worth setting the Xbox aside to listen".|$|E
