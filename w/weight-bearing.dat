5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in his ankle. An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major swelling in a <b>weight-bearing</b> bone in his ankle. Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E
5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing <b>weight-bearing</b> toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
5|$|Out of the {{hundreds}} of known Psittacosaurus specimens, only one has been described to possess any sort of pathology. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to P. mongoliensis, was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation. There is no sign of a bone fracture, but very clear signs of an infection can be seen near the midpoint of the right fibula. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of necrosis {{due to a lack of}} blood supply to the region. The pit is surrounded by a massive amount of swelling along the lower third of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a weight bearing bone in the leg would most likely have been fatal. Unlike the femur and tibia, the fibula is not a <b>weight-bearing</b> bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three <b>weight-bearing</b> toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three <b>weight-bearing</b> toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E
25|$|Body weight–supported {{treadmill}} training {{improves the}} ability of the lumbosacral spinal cord to generate <b>weight-bearing</b> stepping.|$|E
25|$|Injuries to the {{cruciate}} ligament or other ligaments may make post-operative <b>weight-bearing</b> exercise in dogs problematic. Obese dogs, while requiring exercise, may aggravate existing conditions or injure themselves {{due to the}} weight exerted on their joints if walked normally.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the pelvis}} shows the skinny regions {{function}} as arches, transferring {{the weight of}} the upright trunk from the sacrum to the hips. The symphysis pubis connects these two <b>weight-bearing</b> arches, and the ligaments that surround this pelvic region maintain the mechanical integrity.|$|E
25|$|Osteoporosis can be {{minimized}} by smoking cessation, adequate vitamin D intake and regular <b>weight-bearing</b> exercise. The bisphosphate drug alendronate may decrease {{the risk of}} a fracture, in women that have both bone loss and a previous fracture and less so for those with just osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Three of the {{anterior}} muscles are extensors. From its origin on the lateral {{surface of the}} tibia and the interosseus membrane, the three-sided belly of the tibialis anterior extends down below the superior and inferior extensor retinacula to its insertion on the plantar side of the medial cuneiform bone and the first metatarsal bone. In the non-weight-bearing leg, {{the anterior}} tibialis dorsal flexes the foot and lifts the medial edge of the foot. In the <b>weight-bearing</b> leg, it pulls the leg towards the foot. The extensor digitorum longus has a wide origin stretching from the lateral condyle of the tibia down along the anterior side of the fibula, and the interosseus membrane. At the ankle, the tendon divides into four that stretch across the foot to the dorsal aponeuroses of the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. In the non-weight-bearing leg, the muscle extends the digits and dorsiflexes the foot, and in the <b>weight-bearing</b> leg acts similar to the tibialis anterior. The extensor hallucis longus has its origin on the fibula and the interosseus membrane between the two other extensors and is, similarly to the extensor digitorum, is inserted on the last phalanx of big toe ("hallux"). The muscle dorsiflexes the hallux, and acts similar to the tibialis anterior in the <b>weight-bearing</b> leg.|$|E
25|$|Restoration of Euoplocephalus forelimbs {{demonstrate}} {{similarities to}} crocodilian forelimb musculature. The most well developed {{muscles in the}} pectoral region had more of a <b>weight-bearing</b> function than a rotational one. It has also been postulated that the carpals and metacarpals bear resemblance to those of tetrapods with fossorial (burrowing) habits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Weight-bearing</b> {{endurance}} exercise and/or {{exercises to}} strengthen muscles improve bone strength {{in those with}} osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications. There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically {{among those who are}} in care homes.|$|E
25|$|Osteoarthritis {{commonly}} {{affects the}} hands, feet, spine, {{and the large}} <b>weight-bearing</b> joints, such as the hips and knees, although in theory, any joint in the body can be affected. As osteoarthritis progresses, movement patterns (such as gait), are typically affected. Osteoarthritis {{is the most common}} cause of a joint effusion of the knee.|$|E
25|$|Several {{factors may}} help or hinder the bone healing process. For example, {{any form of}} {{nicotine}} hinders the process of bone healing, and adequate nutrition (including calcium intake) will help the bone healing process. <b>Weight-bearing</b> stress on bone, after the bone has healed sufficiently to bear the weight, also builds bone strength.|$|E
25|$|Belly {{dance is}} a non-impact, <b>weight-bearing</b> {{exercise}} {{and is thus}} suitable for all ages. Many of the moves involve isolations, which improves flexibility of the torso. Belly dance moves are beneficial to the spine, as the full-body undulation moves lengthens (decompress) and strengthens the entire column of spinal and abdominal muscles in a gentle way.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} one-story {{building was}} expanded {{in the nineteenth}} century. The present building is cross-vaulted with lunettes and nine fields. It is supported by four <b>weight-bearing</b> columns, which surround but do not form part of the bimah. The bimah is a 1936 reproduction of the bimah lost in a fire in 1934. The masonry columns survived the fire.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaurs {{exhibit a}} pattern of the {{reduction}} and loss of fingers on the lateral side of the hand (digits III, IV and V). The primitive function of the dinosaur hand is grasping with a partially opposable thumb, rather than <b>weight-bearing.</b> The reduction of digits {{is one of the}} defining features of tyrannosaurids, only having two functional digits on very short forelimbs.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the centre}} posts were omitted {{to form a}} triple-aisled longhouse (dreischiffigen Langhaus, often a dreischiffigen Wohnstallhaus) that {{could be found in}} almost all of {{northwest}} Europe in the Early Middle Ages. Its roof structure rested as before on posts set into the ground and was therefore not very durable or <b>weight-bearing.</b> As a result, these houses already had rafters, but no loft to store the harvest. The outer walls were only made of wattle and daub (Flechtwerk).|$|E
25|$|Arthroplasty is an {{orthopedic}} surgery where the articular {{surface of a}} musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis (rheumasurgery) or some other type of trauma. As well as the standard total knee replacement surgery, the uni-compartmental knee replacement, in which only one <b>weight-bearing</b> surface of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a popular alternative.|$|E
25|$|Knee replacement, {{also known}} as knee arthroplasty, is a {{surgical}} procedure to replace the <b>weight-bearing</b> surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. It is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and also for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In patients with severe deformity from advanced rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, or long-standing osteoarthritis, the surgery may be more complicated and carry higher risk. Osteoporosis does not typically cause knee pain, deformity, or inflammation {{and is not a}} reason to perform knee replacement.|$|E
25|$|When {{scoliosis}} is suspected, <b>weight-bearing</b> full-spine AP/coronal (front-back view) and lateral/sagittal (side view) X-rays {{are usually}} taken {{to assess the}} scoliosis curves and the kyphosis and lordosis, as these can also be affected in individuals with scoliosis. Full-length standing spine X-rays are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the scoliosis, and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at three- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, MRI investigation is warranted {{to look at the}} spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} or complement to <b>weight-bearing</b> exercise and medication, canine hydrotherapy may speed recovery after operations or slow {{the progression of}} degenerative conditions. It {{may be used as}} a pre-operative fitness regime to allow a dog to maintain condition before an operation if it can not exercise normally. When a congenital condition is identified in a puppy, it may be the case that surgery is not possible until the animal is physically mature; during the period preceding the surgery, hydrotherapy can be employed to maintain the dog's condition.|$|E
25|$|However, if the {{thyrotoxicosis}} {{is treated}} early, bone loss can be minimized. The level of calcium {{in the blood}} can be determined by a simple blood test, and a bone density scan can document the amount of bone loss. There are many medications that can help to rebuild bone mass and to prevent further bone loss. Risedronate treatment has been demonstrated to help restore bone mass in osteopenia/osteoporosis associated with Graves' disease. Nevertheless, <b>weight-bearing</b> exercises, a balanced diet, calcium intake of about 1500mg a day and enough vitamin D, are of course elementary foundations.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} feature of the farmhouse, albeit one which is not externally visible, is its internal, wooden, post-and-beam construction which supports the entire building. The frame was originally made of oak, which was very durable, but from the 18th century it was also made from cheaper pinewood. To protect it from damp, the wooden posts rest on a stone foundation about 50cm high, often made of fieldstone. The non <b>weight-bearing</b> external walls were built as timber frames, the panels of which were originally filled in with willow wickerwork and clay (wattle and daub) and, later, with brick.|$|E
25|$|Transient {{synovitis}} is {{a diagnosis}} of exclusion. The diagnosis {{can be made in}} the typical setting of pain or limp in a young child who is not generally unwell and has no recent trauma. There is a limited range of motion of the hip joint. Blood tests may show mild inflammation. An ultrasound scan of the hip joint can show a fluid collection (effusion). Treatment is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and limited <b>weight-bearing.</b> The condition usually clears by itself within seven to ten days, but a small group of patients will continue to have symptoms for several weeks. The recurrence rate is 4–17%, most of which is in the first six months.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} {{limits of}} <b>weight-bearing</b> masonry had imposed formal {{as well as}} structural constraints; suddenly, those constraints were gone. None of the historical precedents needed to be applied and this new freedom created a technical and stylistic crisis of sorts. Sullivan addressed it by embracing the changes {{that came with the}} steel frame, creating a grammar of form for the high rise (base, shaft, and cornice), simplifying the appearance of the building by breaking away from historical styles, using his own intricate floral designs, in vertical bands, to draw the eye upward and to emphasize the vertical form of the building, and relating the shape of the building to its specific purpose. All this was revolutionary, appealingly honest, and commercially successful.|$|E
25|$|Ornitholestes {{is often}} {{portrayed as a}} fast, long-legged theropod, but its lower limb bones were fairly short. Osborn (1917) {{calculated}} that the, missing, tibia (shin bone) was only about 70.6% {{as long as the}} femur (thigh bone). The metatarsals (foot bones) were spaced closely, but not fused together. As is typical of theropods, the feet were tridactyl (with three clawed <b>weight-bearing</b> toes). John H. Ostrom (1969) noted that the claw of digit II (the innermost toe) was larger than those of digits III and IV, and suggested that this digit may have borne a modified sickle claw similar to that of Deinonychus. However, as both Ostrom (1969) and Paul (1988) noted, the poor preservation of digit II makes this hypothesis difficult to confirm.|$|E
25|$|Bone is {{constantly}} being created and replaced {{in a process}} known as remodeling. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cells are stimulated by a variety of signals, and together referred to as a remodeling unit. Approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair microdamaged bones from everyday stress, and to shape the skeleton during growth.. Repeated stress, such as <b>weight-bearing</b> exercise or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress (Wolff's law). It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's piezoelectric properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} ingrown toenails to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. Ingrown toenails are caused by <b>weight-bearing</b> (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|E
25|$|The limbs {{were located}} {{underneath}} the body giving Postosuchus an upright stance. Historically, {{there has been}} debate {{over whether or not}} rauisuchids like Postosuchus were mainly bipedal or quadrupedal. Each one of Postosuchuss two forelimbs was slightly over half the size of the hindlimbs. This characteristic of short forelimbs can usually be seen in bipedal reptiles. Chatterjee suggested that Postosuchus could walk in an erect stance, since the short forelimbs were probably used only during slow locomotion. In 1995 Robert Long and Phillip A. Murry argued that Postosuchus was heavily built and quadrupedal. Peyer et al. 2008, argued that the thick pectoral girdle served for locomotion of the forelimbs. However, they noted that this does not detract from the theory that Postosuchus could also walk bipedally. In 2013, a major study of the skeletal structure concluded that Postosuchus may have been an obligate biped based on evidence from the anatomy of the digits, vertebrae, and pelvis. The proportions of the limbs and <b>weight-bearing</b> sections of the spine were very similar to many theropod dinosaurs, nearly all of which are thought to have been strictly bipedal.|$|E
25|$|The {{three main}} {{mechanisms}} by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to MSC biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. {{as a result of}} menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in <b>weight-bearing</b> bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears {{to be the most important}} in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.|$|E
500|$|Tiktaalik lived {{approximately}} 375 {{million years}} ago. Paleontologists {{suggest that it}} is representative of the transition between non-tetrapod vertebrates such as Panderichthys, known from fossils 380 million years old, and early tetrapods such as Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, known from fossils about 365 million years old. Its mixture of primitive fish and derived tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers, Neil Shubin, to characterize Tiktaalik as a [...] "fishapod." [...] Unlike many previous, more fish-like transitional fossils, the [...] "fins" [...] of Tiktaalik have basic wrist bones and simple rays reminiscent of fingers. They may have been <b>weight-bearing.</b> Like all modern tetrapods, it had rib bones, a mobile neck with a separate pectoral girdle, and lungs, though it had the gills, scales, and fins of a fish.|$|E
500|$|Polar bears, otters, and {{fur seals}} have fur, {{one of the}} {{defining}} mammalian features, that is long, oily, and waterproof in order to trap air to provide insulation. [...] In contrast, other marine mammals – such as whales, dolphins, porpoises, manatees, dugongs, and walruses – have lost long fur {{in favor of a}} thick, dense epidermis and a thickened fat layer (blubber) in response to hydrodynamic requirements. Wading and bottom-feeding animals (such as manatees) need to be heavier than water in order to keep contact with the floor or to stay submerged. Surface-living animals (such as sea otters) need the opposite, and free-swimming animals living in open waters (such as dolphins) need to be neutrally buoyant {{in order to be able}} to swim up and down the water column. Typically, thick and dense bone is found in bottom feeders and low bone density is associated with mammals living in deep water. Some marine mammals, such as polar bears and otters, have retained four <b>weight-bearing</b> limbs and can walk on land like fully terrestrial animals.|$|E
500|$|The CP/RA [...] Disney {{bombs were}} [...] long and weighed [...] The {{diameter}} {{of the body of}} the bomb was , while the diameter at the tail was [...] They were composed of three sections. The forward section was the warhead—an explosive charge of [...] of shellite, contained within an armour-piercing casing of thick steel and fitted with two British No.58 MK I tail Pistol fuzes [...] at the base (i.e. furthest from the nose). The second section was made up of nineteen rocket motors from the 3-inch Rocket Projectile - essentially metal tubes filled with cordite. In the third rear section, a tail cone contained the circuit that ignited the rockets. This was powered by a small generator with a vane spun by the airstream going past the falling bomb. Rocket ignition was controlled either by a time-delay switch, or a barometric switch. There were six small fins {{at the rear of the}} bomb for its stabilisation. The bomb was suspended from the aircraft by two <b>weight-bearing</b> lugs. Three arming wires also connected the bomb and the aircraft; as the bomb dropped, a brief tug from the wires would arm the warhead fuzes and the rocket-ignition circuit, and unlock the electrical generator, allowing it to spin freely.|$|E
500|$|The Carthusians bred powerful, <b>weight-bearing</b> {{horses in}} Andalusia for the Crown of Castile, using the finest Spanish Jennets as {{foundation}} bloodstock. These horses were {{a blend of}} Jennet and warmblood breeding, taller and more powerfully built than the original Jennet. By the 15th century, the Andalusian had become a distinct breed, and was being used to influence the development of other breeds. They were also noted for their use as cavalry horses. Even though in the 16th and 17th centuries Spanish horses had not reached the final form of the modern Andalusian, by 1667 William Cavendish, the Duke of Newcastle, called the Spanish horse of Andalusia the [...] "princes" [...] of the horse world, and {{reported that they were}} [...] "unnervingly intelligent". The Iberian horse became known as the [...] "royal horse of Europe" [...] and was seen at many royal courts and riding academies, including those in Austria, Italy, France and Germany. By the 16th century, during the reigns of Charles V (1500–1558) and Phillip II (1556–1581), Spanish horses were considered the finest in the world. Even in Spain, quality horses were owned mainly by the wealthy. During the 16th century, inflation and an increased demand for harness and cavalry horses drove the price of horses extremely high. The always expensive Andalusian became even more so, and it was often impossible to find a member of the breed to purchase at any price.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. Allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that Allosaurus had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than Albertosaurus, Ornithomimus or Archaeornithomimus. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones [...] "were distributed to the proximal phalanges" [...] and occurred across all three <b>weight-bearing</b> toes in [...] "statistically indistinguishable" [...] numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined Allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in Allosaurus provide evidence for [...] "very active" [...] predation-based rather than scavenging diets.|$|E
