30|$|At present, many provinces in China {{plan their}} <b>wind</b> power <b>and</b> PV power {{industry}} separately and normally ignore inherent complementary features between <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> solar power. The high penetration of <b>wind</b> power <b>and</b> PV power may greatly threaten the way power {{systems have been}} operated. If conventional power generation units fail to compensate fluctuating <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> PV power, a certain portion of <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> PV power output {{will have to be}} curtailed. Reports show that curtailments of <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> PV power in ‘Three North’ areas (Northeast, North China and Northwest) of China are very serious. Reasonable capacity planning of <b>wind</b> farms <b>and</b> PV stations is therefore crucial to reduce <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> PV power curtailments. In order to achieve the goal, the time-sequence production simulation (TSPS) technology which is based on space-time complementary advantages between <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> solar energy has been utilized in [6, 7, 8]. One major advantage of TSPS is the capability of incorporating some annual plan of power systems such as thermal unit maintenance schedule <b>and</b> actual <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> PV power plan [9].|$|R

40|$|The use of {{renewable}} energy (RE) sources, primarily <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> solar generation, is poised to grow significantly within the Indian power system.

India’s contribution to global efforts on climate mitigation extends this ambition to 40 % non-fossil-based generation capacity by 2030. Global experience demonstrates that power systems can integrate <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> solar at this scale; however, evidence-based planning is important to achieve <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> solar integration at least cost.
