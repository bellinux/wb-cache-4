25|$|A foundry facing mold wash is a <b>water-based</b> <b>paint</b> of {{amorphous}} or {{fine flake}} graphite. Painting {{the inside of}} a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It {{can be used as a}} dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) emitted from surface coating {{have been caused}} growing public concern for air quality, even low-emitted VOCs from <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> for indoor air quality in Taiwan urban areas. On a view of point on engineering application, the paper proposes a mathematical model to simulate the VOCs dynamic emission based on mass transfer and molecular diffusion theories. A series of field-analogous experiments were carried out to continuously measure VOCs emitted from two typical <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> using GC-FID monitor in an artificial wind tunnel system in this work. With these experimental data, a useful semi-empirical correlation was suggested to estimate VOC emission rates for the <b>water-based</b> <b>paints.</b> It {{was found that the}} dimensionless emission rate (M=m/DpδCo) can be correlated with three dimensionless groups, i. e. Biot number (Bio=hL/Dp), Fourier number (Fom=Dpt/δ 2), and dimensionless air exchange rate (Aer=Nδ 2 /Dp), which is valid in appropriate conditions suggested by this work with a statistical deviation of ± 7. 6 %.

40|$|<b>Water-based</b> {{pressure-sensitive}} <b>paints</b> (PSPs) {{have been}} invented as alternatives to conventional organic-solvent-based pressure-sensitive paints, {{which are used}} primarily for indicating distributions of air pressure on wind-tunnel models. Typically, PSPs are sprayed onto aerodynamic models {{after they have been}} mounted in wind tunnels. When conventional organic-solvent-based PSPs are used, this practice creates a problem of removing toxic fumes from inside the wind tunnels. The use of water-based PSPs eliminates this problem. The waterbased PSPs offer high performance as pressure indicators, plus all the advantages of common <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> (low toxicity, low concentrations of volatile organic compounds, and easy cleanup by use of water) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Water-based</b> acrylic <b>paints</b> were {{subsequently}} sold as latex house paints, as latex is the technical {{term for a}} suspension of polymer microparticles in water.

Exterior latex house paints may also be a co-polymer blend, but the best exterior <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors. Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and PVA (polyvinyl acetate) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.|$|R

50|$|Gouache is a <b>water-based</b> <b>paint</b> {{consisting}} of pigment {{and other materials}} designed {{to be used in}} an opaque painting method. Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher, and an additional, inert, white pigment such as chalk is also present. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective qualities. Like all watermedia, it is diluted with water.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, in {{particular}} after {{a trip to}} Italy, LeWitt started using gouache, an opaque <b>water-based</b> <b>paint,</b> to produce free-flowing abstract works in contrasting colors. These represented {{a significant departure from}} the rest of his practice, as he created these works with his own hands. LeWitt’s gouaches are often created in series based on a specific motif. Past series have included Irregular Forms, Parallel Curves, Squiggly Brushstrokes and Web-like Grids.|$|E
50|$|Early in De Forest's art {{career he}} used {{standard}} oil paint to make landscape paintings. Later, in a deliberate attempt {{to move away}} from abstract expressionism, De Forest stopped using oil paint and began using different mixtures of <b>water-based</b> <b>paint.</b> This does not allow the color of his paintings to blend as it would with oil paint. He sometimes used cheap oil paint as well to get his desired rough, scorched textures.|$|E
50|$|Solvent - this is {{the bulk}} of the paint, it is used to keep the paint {{workable}} when it is wet. After paint is applied to a surface the solvent evaporates, the pigment and binder will coalesce together to form a uniform coating. The solvent is water for <b>water-based</b> <b>paints,</b> and an oil for oil-based paints.|$|R
50|$|Paint {{consists}} of three main components: pigments, resins or binders, and water or solvents. Pigments are finely grounded materials that give out colors or block out the surface beneath it. They may contain other materials such as UV stabilizer, and fillers which bring out the color pigments to the required level. Resins or binders are the glue of the paint to bind pigment and glass beads together to the road surface. The resins for the <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> are polyvinyl acetate latex, methyl methacrylate or acrylic resin. The resins for solvent-based paints are linseed or soya oils and alkyd resins. The pigments and resins are mixed with water for <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> and solvents for solvent-based paints {{so that they can}} be applied onto the road surface. Solvents that are use can be naphtha, toluene, methanol, methylene chloride, and acetone. Due to environmental concerns, some jurisdictions has some restriction on the solvent-based paints.|$|R
50|$|More recent {{developments}} {{have been made}} in tack treatments that are water-soluble, allowing them to be washed from hands, tools or a surface to reduce the incidence of tack transfer from accumulated resins or to wash the tack from the cloths. They can be recycled like utility wipes. Water-soluble tack also improves antistatic performance, and offers potential for improved compatibility with <b>water-based</b> <b>paints.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{surfaces}} of veneer cross-plywood and {{laminated veneer lumber}} can be designed {{in many different ways}} by pressing the top layers of fine wood sliced veneers, such as oak, maple, cherry, ash, walnut and other woods. Further design possibilities offer colored melamine films; decorative films, digital prints and decorative laminates (HPL / CPL) and of course the pickling and painting, either transparent or opaque. Modern <b>water-based</b> <b>paint</b> systems are used for this.|$|E
50|$|Body {{corrosion}} - Most {{model year}} {{versions of the}} W210 displayed body rust, notably on European-sold cars. Rust would sometimes appear spontaneously on panels such as doors and roofs on cars {{less than a year}} old. In response to this problem, the manufacturer would normally change or repair the affected panels under warranty. Mercedes-Benz has been criticized in the European press for not officially acknowledging this problem. This was due to problems introducing <b>water-based</b> <b>paint</b> technology.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this project}} to test practice-oriented {{procedures}} that will allow for a broad application of electrostatic coating techniques for wood and wood com-posites. The underlying coating principle "Electric discharge across the wet paint film" has already been tested in the feasibility study for wood composites (Funding No. BW D 20002), and {{has been found to be}} suitable for practical use. For the testing of practice-proof procedures, three examples of application, namely - Finish painting of window frames, - Textured finishing of kitchen fronts, and - High-gloss painting of car interior parts were acquired, reset in the coating lab of Fraunhofer IPA (average value and dis-tribution of film thickness analog to practice examples), and finally the coating process was carried out with electrostatic high-speed rotational bells. In the present studies, considerable improvements compared to the current status of the practice examples could be obtained by using electrostatic high-speed rotational atomization for <b>water-based</b> <b>paints.</b> Both, average value and distribution of film thickness could be reproduced as on the original parts. Chemical and physical resistance of the <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> that were used in the electrostatic coating tests, however, differ from the values of the original paints. In the electrostatic application, the soiling tendency has been found to be non-critical, as long as plant dimensions, booth air flow, and atomizer control are operated in an adapted manner. The coating of wood and wood composites by electrostatic high-speed rotational bells offers high saving potentials. For a successful implementation, clearance tests are required for the <b>water-based</b> <b>paints</b> to be used...|$|R
