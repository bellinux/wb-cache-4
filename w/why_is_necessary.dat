Furthermore form changes of recess inside of the head measured on real samples will be considered. All these variances from nominal values are necessary to analyse in more details, because they can participate in destruction of ceramic heads. The stem system, ceramic head and load cone (DHK) will be simulated as a 2 D axisymetric task and 3 D quarter symetrical task.

Title of Thesis: Influence of benzoxazinedione {{derivatives}} {{on selected}} mycobacterial enzymes Tuberculosis is an insidious infectious disease {{with more and}} more increasing incidence in certain regions. It is difficult to treat by the available means because of increasing cases of multidrug resistance, which is defined as a resistance of M. tuberculosis at least to two primary antituberculotic drugs - rifampicin and isoniazid.

Organized crime acts now on a transnational and cross-border basis, exploits for its benefit globalization, the abolition of border controls within the European Union (EU) and the legislative differences between Member States (MS), in order to accrue more and larger profits. For this reason, should be combated with the same approach by the prosecuting authorities of the MS and on a unified basis. The consequences of this phenomenon, largely affect the obligations of the European Union (EU) versus its citizens and that is <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> one coherent political action of institutions for the fight against organized crime, which will have specific and important effects.

The software enables direct access to a database of historical prices and has an implemented a programming language that allows effective processing of statistical analyzes, which is required for development of investment strategies. The investment strategies are optimized and tested on a database of historical price movements from 1. 1. 2004 to 31. 12. 2012 for the major currency pairs EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY. The main assumption of entry to the market for proposed investment strategies is based on specific time intervals during the day, where is an increased probability of new short-term trends beginnings.

40|$|Visual Telepresence {{system which}} utilize virtual reality style helmet mounted {{displays}} {{have a number}} of limitations. The geometry of the camera positions and of the display is fixed and is most suitable only for viewing elements of a scene at a particular distance. In such a system, the operator's ability to gaze around without use of head movement is severely limited. A trade off must be made between a poor viewing resolution or a narrow width of viewing field. To address these limitations a prototype system where the geometry of the displays and cameras is dynamically controlled by the eye movement of the operator has been developed. This paper explores the reasons <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to actively adjust both the display system and the cameras and furthermore justifies the use of mechanical adjustment of the displays as an alternative to adjustment by electronic or image processing methods. The electronic and mechanical design is described including optical arrangements and control algorithms, An assessment of the performance of the system against a fixed camera/display system when operators are assigned basic tasks involving depth and distance/size perception.
