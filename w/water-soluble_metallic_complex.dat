One of the most stable clusters is Au 25 (SG) 18, which are negatively charged in solution and highly monodisperse making them ideal for characterization and analysis applications.

The effect appears over a range of PEG sizes and ionic strengths.

Cisplatin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{employed}} <b>metallic</b> <b>complexes</b> for cancer treatment. However, its effectiveness is hindered by toxic side effects and the occurrence of tumor resistance. Trying to overcome these drawbacks, a considerable interest in searching new <b>metallic</b> <b>complexes</b> to be used in the treatment of cancer has emerged. Among the new nonplatinum as potential anticancer drugs, gold derivatives have gained increasing attention due to their generally strong tumor cell growth inhibiting effects and the observation that many of the compounds inhibit the enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). In the design of a drug, a balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity is required to be water soluble and at the same time be able to pass through the phospholipid cell membrane. Accordingly, water solubility of the drugs could provide such balanced relationship. The use of water-soluble phosphanes can lead to the synthesis of water soluble or partially soluble complexes.
