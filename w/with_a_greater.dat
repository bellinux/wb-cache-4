5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> chance to escape.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake is associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In {{adults and children}} with no acute illness, {{a decrease in the}} intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> degree of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E
5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} exist and {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, Australia {{considered}} {{joining the}} MRCA programme {{to find a}} replacement for their ageing Dassault Mirage IIIs; ultimately the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet was selected to meet the requirement. Canada similarly opted for the F/A-18 after considering the Tornado. Japan considered the Tornado in the 1980s, along with the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and F/A-18; before selecting the Mitsubishi F-2, a domestically produced design based on the F-16. In the 1990s, both Taiwan and South Korea expressed interest in acquiring {{a small number of}} Tornado ECR aircraft. In 2001, EADS proposed a Tornado ECR variant <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> electronic warfare capability for Australia.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> degree of π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than {{is found in the}} analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing {{the letter to}} the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E

5|$|Liver {{dysfunction}} as {{a result}} of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> likelihood of complications and death.|$|E
5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E

5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by the pet trade, and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner. This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, the pet trade is inflated by replacements. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> purchasing power, the increasing human populations in the species' range could have an even more serious impact.|$|E
