A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R

Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale. They can be used to cook toast with toppings, like garlic bread or cheese, though they tend to produce drier toast since their heating elements are located farther from the toast (to allow larger items to be cooked). They take 4-6 minutes to make toast as compared to 2-3 minutes in pop-up toasters. Since the toast lies on bars in a toaster oven, the toast will have untoasted stripes on one side. The evidence from product testing does not indicate that convection oven toaster ovens perform better than regular toaster ovens. People wishing to make large amounts of toast in a toaster oven should check the size before purchase, as even seemingly large toaster ovens may not fit six standard-size pieces of bread.|$|R
50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung on a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> connected to tracks that are suspended from channels {{on the floor and}} ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Excessive {{environmental}} vibrations {{can have}} deleterious effects {{in a variety}} of animals. Despite the potentially detrimental effects vibrations may have on animal health and experimental results, they remain poorly understood in the animal laboratory setting. This study investigates the consequences of excessive train vibrations on the breeding success of laboratory mice. An instrumented cage, featuring a high sensitivity microphone and accelerometer, was used to characterize the vibrations and noise in a vivarium that is in close proximity to an active railroad. The passing trains cause vibrations of a magnitude that is three times larger than the ambient vibrations caused by the mice. The majority of the noise recorded within the laboratory facility was below the audible range of mice and was thus considered to not have a significant erect on them. Low breeding rates were observed and are hypothesized {{to be the result of}} the train vibrations. To verify the effect of the train vibrations, a controlled vibration study was conducted by using a custom-built electromagnetic shaker to simulate the train vibrations. Mice, which were unaccustomed to train vibrations, served as the test subjects and were vibrated in a facility far from the railroad tracks. The stress levels of the mice test groups, featuring both males and females, were compared to control groups in order to establish the signifcance of the results. It was determined that vibrations similar to those produced by a passing train can create large fluctuations in the stress levels of female mice. These fluctuations in stress levels warrant concern due to the negative effects that stress can have on mice and, consequently, on experimental outcomes. In order to alleviate further negative impacts on laboratory research, a vibration isolating caster system will be designed to replace the on currently being used on the <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> on which the mouse are housed...|$|R
40|$|A {{material}} can enhance or distract from the end-user experience {{and is an}} important decision for designers. As such, material libraries exist to provide designers with a hands-on resource to understanding materials beyond just data sheets. When we took 2. 009, a mechanical engineering capstone class, we {{found it difficult to}} decide which materials to use. Thus, in this work, we sought to create a materials library under an engineering context for student product designers to use. To understand how material libraries function and which materials would best suit the collection, we benchmarked three physical and one virtual material library. We also sought input from those involved in product design classes, such as past students, Professor Wallace who teaches 2. 009, and Pappalardo shop staff who support the students in their creations. We also looked at past receipts to supplement our knowledge as well as looked at distributors and what they offered to expand our selection. Our six main categories of materials were: woods, metals, composites, polymers, fabrics, and Smooth-On products. The material libraries key criteria were to be well organized, portable, and useful. We went through several design sketches before deciding on utilizing a modular <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> so we could place dividers and shelves as necessary. A coding system was also implemented that included main categories and subcategories with associated colors to help with the user experience of quickly locating, using, and returning. Each material comes attached with information and a more complete overview is located in an information packet. While this first version the materials library was met with excitement, {{it is by no means}} complete. As such, there are also a number of ways to improve the experience and the collection. by Patricia Das and Roget Mo. Thesis: S.
