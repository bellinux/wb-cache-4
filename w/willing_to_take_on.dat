He said that he had initially not been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the mission unless the mandate was expanded to cover all sides. Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|The large {{budget and}} notable talent {{for the project}} made it {{difficult}} for the production company to secure directors <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the series, causing 2009 to begin with a brief stir of media attention. Shortly thereafter, Taewon announced that the search was over and Kim Kyu-tae and Yang Yun-ho would be helming the series. Simultaneously, KBS was announced as the South Korean broadcaster. Later in the month, on February 19, Kim So-yeon was cast as a North Korean agent.|$|E
5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, {{causing her to}} lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which {{turns out to be a}} huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape.|$|E

5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E

25|$|Reviewing project {{costs in}} late 1973, the Syncrude {{consortium}} found that costs {{had more than}} doubled, from $1 billion to $2.3 billion. In December 1974, Atlantic Richfield (whose American parent needed cash to develop its Prudhoe Bay interests) withdrew its 30 per cent participation in the project. A few days later, the three remaining partners informed the Alberta government that the maximum risk they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the project was $1 billion. They would need to find another $1 billion of risk capital if the project were to go on. The alternative - shutting down the project - would have cost the four partners (Including Atlantic Richfield) an estimated $250 million.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1947 with Project Sign, {{which then}} became Project Grudge and finally Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force {{conducted}} formal studies of UFOs, {{a subject of}} considerable public and some governmental interest. Blue Book had come under increasing criticism in the 1960s. Growing numbers of critics—including U.S. politicians, newspaper writers, UFO researchers, scientists {{and some of the}} general public—were suggesting that Blue Book was conducting shoddy, unsupported research or perpetrating a cover up. The Air Force did not want to continue its studies but did not want a cessation of studies to provoke additional charges of a cover-up. UFOs had become such a controversial issue that no other government agency was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> further UFO studies.|$|E
25|$|His {{success in}} the United States brought Barnard to the {{attention}} of new McLaren team boss Ron Dennis, and in 1980 he joined the team and began working on the McLaren MP4 (MP4/1), the first Carbon-Fibre-Composite (CFC) chassis in Formula One, alongside the Lotus 88 designed by Colin Chapman. The chassis itself was built by one of the team's sponsors Hercules Aerospace in the US after former Hercules apprentice and then McLaren engineer Steve Nichols had advised Barnard, who along with Dennis had been unsuccessfully searching in England for a company <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the job, that the US based company might be their best choice, and quickly revolutionised car design in Formula One with new levels of rigidity and driver protection.|$|E
25|$|Nathan-Turner {{had thought}} that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other {{producer}} available or <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he {{had little choice but}} to either accept this or resign from the Corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he ever let on.|$|E

500|$|Piłsudski {{agreed to}} serve in the Regency Kingdom of Poland created by the Central Powers, and acted as {{minister}} of war in the newly formed Polish Regency government; as such he was responsible for the Polnische Wehrmacht. After the Russian Revolution in early 1917, and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men no longer be treated as [...] "German colonial troops" [...] and only be used to fight Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side. In the aftermath of a July 1917 [...] "Oath Crisis" [...] when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear an oath of loyalty to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at Magdeburg; the Polish units were disbanded, and the men were incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Army, while the Polish Military Organization began attacking German targets. Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> all the partitioning powers.|$|E
500|$|The Mercedes storyline was {{met with}} widely {{divergent}} reactions, though her musical numbers were generally given high marks. In addition to Urban, many reviewers were unhappy {{with the return of}} the Rachel versus Mercedes rivalry, including Bell, who lamented that it had [...] "been done every season". Nearly as many expressed the hope that Mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in the first [...] "booty camp" [...] scene, including Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger, BuddyTV John Kubicek, and West. Benigno felt Mercedes was acting [...] "wildly out of character" [...] in the episode. Michael Slezak of TVLine was also puzzled at her change, and asked, [...] "When has Mercedes ever been anything other than a team player and New Directions MVP? Seriously, nobody's going to cut her slack for a bad week?" [...] Canning agreed, and wrote: [...] "Schue's tough love with Mercedes came out of left field", and felt it added to the [...] "inconsistency of these characters", even though [...] "it ultimately made sense" [...] in the context of setup for [...] "It's All Over". Time James Poniewozik wrote that having the story [...] "turn on her resentment at being overlooked by the glee club is an apt meta-touch, since she's been overlooked by the show for some time now." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was the most enthusiastic about her storyline, and called it [...] "the best part of the episode": it was [...] "all about how she now feels appreciated—because she has a boyfriend, sigh—and so she's <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Rachel for the role of Maria (and, actually, beat her) and push for what she feels is rightfully hers, which involves more respect from New Directions." ...|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Besson {{envisioned the}} world of The Fifth Element {{in an attempt to}} {{alleviate}} boredom. He began writing the script when he was 16, though it was not released in cinemas until he was 38. The original storyline was set in the year 2300, and was about a [...] "nobody" [...] named Zaltman Bleros (later renamed Korben Dallas) who wins a trip to the Club Med resort on the planet Fhloston Paradise. There he meets Leeloo, a [...] "sand-girl" [...] who has the [...] "beauty of youth" [...] despite being over 2,000 years old. Besson continued to work on and modify the storyline for years; by the time his documentary film Atlantis was released in 1991 he had a 400-page script. Nicolas Seydoux and Patrice Ledoux from Gaumont were the first people to take on the project. In November 1991, while looking for actors for the film, Besson met French comics creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières and recruited them for the film's production design. Giraud and Mézières's comics were a major source of inspiration for Besson's futuristic New York City. Mézières wrote the book The Circles of Power, which contains a character named S'Traks, who drives a flying taxicab through the congested air traffic of the vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Mézières showed images of the flying taxi to Besson, who was inspired to change the background of Korben Dallas from a worker in a rocketship factory to that of a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York City. Five other artists were hired for the project, and Jean Paul Gaultier was hired to design the film's costumes. The team spent a year creating over 8,000 drawings, during which time Besson approached both Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson for the lead role. Willis expressed interest, though he was reluctant to take on the role as the film was considered risky after his previous two films, Hudson Hawk and Billy Bathgate, had been received poorly; Gibson eventually turned down the role. While the team impressed film companies with their designs, they struggled to find one <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the film's budget of almost $100 million. In December 1992 production of the film stopped without any prior warning, and the team disbanded.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{challenge}} facing labor and employment {{policy in the}} next decade is to reconstruct the social contract between the American workforce and employers in ways that address the needs and realities of a modern economy and society. To do so the country <b>will</b> need <b>to</b> modernize the labor and employment policies carried over from the New Deal era and foster innovations in labor unions, labor market institutions, corporations, and in their relationships. Unfortunately, the political <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> this task is absent at the national level of policy making and political discourse. Instead, the past two decades have been characterized by failed efforts at incremental reforms in labor policy, starting with the 1977 labor law reform debate and more recently illustrated by the failure of the Dunlop Commission to break the political impasse over labor and employment policy. The result is that analysis and debates over these issues have been marginalized as “special interest politics. ...|$|R
