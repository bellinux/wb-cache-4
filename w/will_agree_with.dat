500|$|Although Wollstonecraft argues against {{excessive}} sensibility, {{the rhetoric}} of the Rights of Woman is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at Rousseau. For example, after excerpting a long passage from [...] (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, [...] "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness." [...] A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes [...] "I must relieve myself by drawing another picture." [...] These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.|$|E

40|$|Seismic {{attenuation}} and dispersion can {{be caused}} by numerous distinct mechanisms. Observed or proposed mechanisms include mineral surface-fluid interaction, microscopic squirt between pores, macroscopic fluid motion between heterogeneous regions, and bulk loss within the fluid phase itself. The lack of an understanding of these various processes renders interpretation of attenuation-related attributes problematic at best. Direct measurement of seismic attenuation (1 /Q) and velocity dispersion in the laboratory help discriminate among these mechanisms and ascertain which dominate for particular lithologies or saturation conditions. Fluid motion is a primary mechanism in porous, permeable clastics. In shales, however, bulk fluid motion is inhibited and clay particle interaction with bound water may dominate. Heavy, viscous fluids themselves show bulk losses independent of a rock matrix. All these loss mechanisms are frequency dependent, so observations of 1 /Q made at seismic frequencies usually <b>will</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> sonic log measurements, which, in turn, <b>will</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> ultrasonic data...|$|R

2500|$|... "Omichund, his {{confidential}} servant, as he thought, {{told his}} master {{of an agreement}} made between the English and Monsieur Duprée [...] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding {{this to be the}} man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We therefore made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr. Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nawab; and that Mr. Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr. Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose we signed another treaty. The one was called the Red, the other the White treaty. This treaty was signed by every one, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, that, when the very existence of the Company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, {{it was a matter of}} true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Erika Raeder's {{campaign}} to free {{her husband was}} joined by German veterans, who bombarded the American, British and French governments with demands that Raeder, who they claimed was an innocent man wrongly convicted at Nuremberg, be freed. Admiral Gottfried Hanson, head of the Verband deutscher Soldaten veterans' group in a letter in support of Raeder sent to the three western high commissioners' for Germany declared: [...] "As a friend of many years' standing, and certain that all ex-members of the Navy <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, I venture to say that no military leader could have educated and influenced his subordinates from a higher moral and Christian level than did Raeder...both as {{a man and a}} Christian...How can genuine peace and real understanding among the nations of the occident be brought about...if true right and justice is not applied to the Germans that are still be kept prisoners?" [...] In an interview in November 1950, Admiral Hanson claimed that American and other United Nations commanders fighting in the Korean War would have been convicted of aggression if the same standards that were applied to Raeder applied to them. The French High Commissioner in Germany André François-Poncet replied that the admiral seemed ill-informed about history and the law, stating that North Korea had attacked South Korea, and that UN forces in Korea were fighting in response to South Korean appeals for help and under the authority of the UN Security Council, which did not correspond at all to the situation with Norway in 1940. In Britain, the {{campaign to}} free Raeder was headed by the historian Captain Basil Liddell Hart and Lord Hankey, both of whom repeatedly charged that the attack on Norway was a [...] "preventive war" [...] forced on Germany, and as such, not only was Raeder innocent, but that Winston Churchill should have been convicted of conspiracy to commit aggression against Norway in place of Raeder. Hankey used his seat in the House of Lords to express his support for Raeder while Liddell Hart in a series of widely publicised interviews claimed that Raeder was an innocent man. A good part of Hankey's 1950 book Politics, Trials, and Errors, in which Hankey argued for the innocence of all the German and Japanese war criminals convicted by Allied courts and strenuously attacked the legitimacy of war crimes trials was taken up with a defence of Raeder. Hankley claimed that even in 1940 it was clear that invasion of Norway had been a defensive move forced on Raeder by Britain. More recently, the American journalist Patrick Buchanan in his 2008 book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War defended Raeder, arguing that the real aggressor against Norway was Churchill, and Raeder should never been convicted at Nuremberg. The American historian Norman Goda wrote that Raeder's champions usually spoke if aggression against Norway {{was the only thing that}} Raeder had been convicted of, and that campaign to free Raeder rested upon [...] "...a quasi-legal argument mixed with moral equivalency and wilful ignorance". Goda charged that Erika Raeder and her friends had grossly quoted out of context certain passages from Churchill's 1948 book The Gathering Storm to support their claim that the invasion of Norway was a [...] "preventive war" [...] forced on the Third Reich while ignoring the evidence that had convicted Raeder at Nuremberg. Starting in 1950, the government of Konrad Adenauer started a quiet diplomatic offensive aimed at freeing Raeder and the rest of the men in Spandau. An American diplomat Richard Lynch reported back to Washington in 1954 that public opinion in West Germany was all for freeing Raeder and the rest of the men convicted in Nuremberg, and until the admirals in Spandau were freed, [...] "the feelings does exist and...until some way can be found to overcome it, a future German Navy will not have the support of its former officers". The retired Admiral Gerhard Wagner had told Lynch that many Kriegsmarine officers would liked to join the new Bundesmarine in order to fight the Soviets should World War Three break out, but refused to do so as long as Raeder and Dönitz were still prisoners. It was the position of the United States government in the 1950s that Raeder should be freed, ostensibly for reasons of health, but in fact because of the demands of the Cold War and the need to integrate West Germany into NATO.|$|E
