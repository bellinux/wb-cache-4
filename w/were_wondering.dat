25|$|During the attack, an Iraqi {{doctor who}} was {{next door to}} the police station was alerted to the fact of the six RMPs being under siege and drove to the edge of town in an {{ambulance}} where a Major from 1 Para had established an Incident Control Point (ICP). He informed the Paratroopers of the RMPs plight at about midday local time and conveyed to the Paratroopers that the RMPs were being held hostage. At 12:30pm, Dr. Fasal returned to the ICP and informed Major Kemp that three of the British were dead. By now, with all 1 Para troops accounted for, the staff in the Ops Room <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> who they could be and realized that they must be the six-man RMP section. By the time the doctor had returned to the police station, all of the RMPs were dead, and for a third time, he returned to the checkpoint with the bad news. Later, Dr. Fasal brought all of the bodies out to the checkpoint and handed them over to the British.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 the Feyenoord Supporters Vereniging <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> {{about whether}} or not it would be {{possible}} to create more atmosphere inside the stadium mainly during important matches. As a result, a few huge flags were produced and brought into the stadium prior to matches played by Feyenoord. The flags were a success, but people started asking for more activities and a meeting between fans and officials were arranged. In 2000 Harry Veth was given permission to establish a group of five Feyenoord fans called TIFO team Feyenoord Rotterdam. Besides creating more flags and small pieces of paper released from the second platform the team also started to organise bigger activities. The first big activity was held on 10 December 2000 when Feyenoord faced Ajax and 40 fog machines were activated when the players entered the pitch. In the following years many different and various activities were held to improve the atmosphere inside the stadium. Feyenoord's TIFO team became famous abroad as well and the Italian TIFO foundation awarded Feyenoord the Best of TIFO Award 2000/2001.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1910s, the Pennsylvania {{received}} the FF-1 but decided it was too slow for passenger trains and was relegated to heavy freight service. In the mid 1920s, they received the L5 electric which had third rail power supply at the time. When the Pennsylvania built the O1 and the P5, they chose the P5 over the O1 for its ability and power on the rails. After a grade cross accident with the P5, the cab {{was moved to the}} center and was designated P5a. Pennsylvania still searched for the ultimate electric since the P5 did not track well at high speeds and <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> if the P5a could be improved even further. Soon enough, the Pennsylvania was in luck and found two contacts as early as 1932. The mechanical design of the GG1 was based largely on the New Haven EP3, which had been borrowed earlier from the New Haven Railroad by the PRR to compare it to its current standard electric locomotive, the P5a. In 1933, the PRR decided to replace its P5a locomotives and told General Electric and Westinghouse to design prototype locomotives with the following specifications: a lighter axle load and more power than the P5a, a top speed of at least , a streamlined body design and a single (central) control cab.|$|E

After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them.

500|$|A {{contemporary}} review {{from the}} Tamil monthly magazine Kalaimanram praised AVM for novelty and called Andha Naal a daring venture. The Tamil weekly Kumudam (dated 1 May 1954) praised Meiyappan for recognising [...] "young talents" [...] like Balachander and Seetharaman. However, the reviewer criticised AVM for not publicising {{the film as}} a thriller; he asserted that had the film been publicised in such manner, the fans {{would not have been}} horrified by the absence of songs in the film. The reviewer's verdict was [...] "Success of art; failure of narrative". The same month, a meeting was organised by the Film Fans Association in Madras to congratulate Meiyappan, Balachander, the actors and the other crew members. V. C. Gopalaratnam, the president of the association, praised Meiyappan for his [...] "pioneering spirit" [...] in producing a film without songs or dances. The Tamil magazine Gundoosi said that, for fans who <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> whether there would be a day when a shorter film without songs and dance would be produced that had a narrative beyond the traditional love story, [...] "That Day has come. Such a cinema of renaissance is Andha Naal". The writer also appreciated Maruti Rao's cinematography and Meiyappan's courageous effort, and asked fans to support such a film if they [...] "really want Tamil cinema to progress". The Indian Express praised the script by Seetharaman, the performances of Ganesan, Pandari Bai and Sambandam, the absence of songs and dance, and concluded that the film was [...] "remarkable for some fine and original ideas in photography".|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vaughn had {{a little}} trouble {{adapting}} to film: the film had no studio. The big studios doubted the success of an adaptation as a violent superhero, which made the film be independently financed, but this gave him the freedom to make the film the way he imagined, without {{having to worry about}} high-censorship. Vaughn believed enough in the project to raise the money himself. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist) said that the creators of the film <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> whether a distributor would pick up the movie.

2500|$|In {{the words}} of {{historian}} M.L. Bruce, both Thomas and Elizabeth [...] "developed feelings of dislike" [...] for their daughter Mary. In later years, Mary's romantic involvements would only further strain this relationship. Around 1520, the Boleyns managed to arrange Mary's marriage to William Carey, a respected and popular man at court. It was sometime after the wedding that Mary became mistress to Henry VIII (the exact dates as to when the affair started and ended are unknown), although she never held the title of [...] "official royal mistress," [...] as the post {{did not exist in}} England. It has long been rumoured that one or both of Mary Boleyn's children were fathered by Henry and not Carey. Some historians, such as Alison Weir, now question whether Henry Carey was fathered by the King. Few of Henry's mistresses were ever publicly honoured, except Elizabeth Blount, who was mentioned in Parliament and whose son, Henry Fitzroy, was created Duke of Richmond and Somerset in an elaborate public ceremony in 1525. Henry's relationship with Mary was so discreet that within ten years, some observers <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> if it had ever taken place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{movie is}} based on Sully's {{autobiography}} , rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted the film to encompass [...] "that sense of our common humanity", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: [...] "People <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone {{a chance to have}} hope, {{at a time when we}} all needed it." [...] Komarnicki said the difficulty was not depicting the landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: [...] "It wasn't really a challenge of what to do with the event since that is the thing everyone knows about, it was more about how you parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with the investigators it was actually seemingly going the other way." ...|$|E

[...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong."
