40|$|The {{trend for}} a more {{sustainable}} style of living, the tightening legislation of waste treatment, depletion of natural resources, and the increasing amount of waste have created a good inducement for manufacturing <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composites</b> from different recycled materials. The main aim of this thesis was to study how different recycled raw materials affect the properties and profitability of <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composites.</b> Materials from construction and demolition industry and mining and packaging industry were used as fillers or as strengthening fibers. In another case, plastic materials from construction and demolition industry and from municipalities were used as the matrix. Some composites manufactured from different recycled materials were selected for comparing their costs to a composite manufactured from virgin materials. Mechanical and moisture resistance tests were carried out to evaluate {{the properties of the}} composites. The use of recycled material improved some properties and weakened some others. Construction and mining waste improved the moisture resistance, packaging waste improved the impact strength, and plastic waste decreased the price of the composite. There was no composite where all features were improved. The change of the properties was highly dependent on the materials used. The price of the composite decreased in all cases except one, when recycled raw materials were used, and even significantly when recycled plastic was used. The results of the study showed {{that it is possible to}} use recycled raw materials as a part of <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composites.</b> The lower price and some improved properties encourage using recycled materials, when the features of the composite are understood. Due to the tightening legislation, there will be more material available for <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composites</b> in the future.

50|$|Wood-plastic {{composites}} {{are still}} new materials {{relative to the}} long history of natural lumber as a building material. The most widespread use of WPCs in North America is in outdoor deck floors, but it is also used for railings, fences, landscaping timbers, cladding and siding, park benches, molding and trim, window and door frames, and indoor furniture. Wood-plastic composites were first introduced into the decking market in the early 1990s. Manufacturers claim that <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composite</b> is more environmentally friendly and requires less maintenance than the alternatives of solid wood treated with preservatives or solid wood of rot-resistant species. These materials can be molded with or without simulated wood grain details.|$|E
50|$|WPCs do not corrode and {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to rot, decay, and Marine Borer attack, {{though they do}} absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material. They have good workability and can be shaped using conventional woodworking tools. WPCs are often considered a sustainable material {{because they can be}} made using recycled plastics and the waste products of the wood industry. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composite</b> difficult to recycle again after use. They can however be recycled easily in a new <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composite,</b> much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves. Another major selling point of these materials is their lack of need for paint. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, but are widely available in grays and earth tones. Despite up to 70 percent cellulose content (although 50/50 is more common), the mechanical behavior of WPCs is most similar to neat polymers. Neat polymers are polymerized without added solvents. This means that WPCs have a lower strength and stiffness than wood, and they experience time and temperature-dependent behavior. The wood particles are susceptible to fungal attack, though not as much so as solid wood, and the polymer component is vulnerable to UV degradation. It is possible that the strength and stiffness may be reduced by moisture absorption and freeze-thaw cycling, though testing is still being conducted in this area. Some WPC formulations are sensitive to staining from a variety of agents.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a simulation study and experimental verification of a die design in extrusion processing <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composite</b> profile. Flow balancing at the die exit {{is a major}} challenge in the profile extrusion die design as an unbalanced flow causes imperfect profile output.

In the cases of similar processing parameters, although cutting temperature for massoniana wood is always higher than WPCs, the change trends of their cutting temperature are similar.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} and properties of wood fiber {{is one of}} many factors of critical importance to the performance of <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composites.</b> In commercial thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP) of wood chips to produce fibers, high temperatures (> 100 °C) are used to separate the fibers during TMP refining. These mechanical pressures and temperatures are usually modulated to achieve the desired fiber {{characteristics and}} properties. However, relatively high total electric energy is required to produce these TMP pulps. Recently, an oxalic-acid pretreatment of wood chips prior to TMP refining has been developed. Previous, experiments have found that the energy required in refining after such pretreatment can be dramatically reduced. In addition, other work with medium-density fiberboard made using TMP fiber from oxalic acid-pretreated chips was shown to have enhanced moisture resistance when compared to fiberboard made with non-treated fiber. In the experiments reported in this paper, wood chips were first pre-treated using either oxalic acid- or dialkyl ester oxalic acid-derivatives, then refined into fiber using traditional TMP refining processes. These variously treated fiber groupings were then compounded with high-density polyethylene and injected molded into flexural test specimens (ASTM D 790). <b>Wood-plastic</b> <b>composites</b> made using fibers from these oxalic acid- and diethyloxalate-pretreatments were shown to produce <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composites</b> with similar mechanical performance to that of composites made using untreated control fibers. With further work, oxalic acid- and diethyloxalate-pretreatments may result in a modified wood fiber that has potential to enhance physical properties such as dimensional stability, has virtually no effect on mechanical performance, but greatly diminishes the energy required to refine pine chips into fiber...|$|R

40|$|Engineered wood materials, {{also known}} as <b>wood-plastic</b> <b>composites</b> (WPCs), are being {{investigated}} by the U. S. Navy for waterfront construction applications primarily because of their superior durability characteristics compared to wood. Durability, however, reaches beyond structural integrity and biodeterioration effects. Fire performance requirements are also critical issues in the acceptance of new combustible construction materials. To address fire performance issues in waterfront construction test methods and protocols were investigated. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine Navy requirements for waterfront component fire resistance, to identify or develop test protocol requirements, and to initiate small sample fire testing based on those requirements. Currently the Navy’s criteria documents defer to NFPA 307, Construction and Fire Protection of Marine Terminals, Piers and Wharves, where component cross-sectional area is a determining factor. Because WPCs allow for hollow cross sections, these criteria will need to be modified.
