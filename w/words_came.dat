5|$|The {{original}} idea for The Garden of <b>Words</b> <b>came</b> from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.|$|E

25|$|Several more {{dictionaries}} followed: in Latin, English, French and Italian. Benjamin Martin's Lingua Britannica Reformata (1749) and Ainsworth's Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (1737) {{are both}} significant, {{in that they}} define entries in separate senses, or aspects, of the word. In English (among others), John Cowell's Interpreter, a law dictionary, was published in 1607, Edward Phillips' The new world of English <b>words</b> <b>came</b> out in 1658 and a dictionary of 40,000 words had been prepared in 1721 by Nathan Bailey, though none was as comprehensive in breadth or style as Johnson's.|$|E

500|$|The main {{response}} to Fielding's <b>words</b> <b>came</b> from John Hill, an English author, botanist, and literary critic {{who wrote a}} column called [...] "The Inspector" [...] in the London Daily Advertiser. Hill used this column approximately one week later to attack Fielding and criticise Amelia. Fielding replied {{in much the same}} fashion in the second issue of the Journal, while attempting to defend his novel. The two engaged in a sustained dispute, as each used their respective publication to joust with the other.|$|E
500|$|Because of Grossman's {{hostility to}} Hammond, Columbia paired Dylan with a young, African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson. Wilson recalled: [...] "I didn't even {{particularly}} like folk music. I'd been recording Sun Ra and Coltrane ... I thought folk music {{was for the}} dumb guys. [...] played like the dumb guys, but then these <b>words</b> <b>came</b> out. I was flabbergasted." [...] At a recording session on April 24, produced by Wilson, Dylan recorded five new compositions: [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Talkin' World War III Blues", [...] "Bob Dylan's Dream", and [...] "Walls of Red Wing". [...] "Walls of Red Wing" [...] was ultimately rejected, but the other four were included in a revised album sequence.|$|E
500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if the <b>words</b> <b>came</b> out like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, {{some of which were}} picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E

500|$|After leaving MacEwan University in Edmonton at 20, Powter {{moved to}} Vancouver, British Columbia {{where he played}} {{keyboards}} before he started composing songs. In 1997, he partnered with music producer Jeff Dawson; they recorded [...] "Bad Day" [...] in 2002. For two weeks, Powter had a melody that [...] "wouldn't go away" [...] from his mind. Thinking of a lyric that would fit the melody, he thought an [...] "up and poppy" [...] lyric would make it [...] "the cheesiest song of all time". He then thought [...] "bad day" [...] {{would be a good}} choice for the chorus, and wrote the lyrics partly based on his life as [...] "a struggling musician". It was the last song to be composed for his album, with Powter writing it in an hour during a ferry journey between Victoria and Vancouver. Powter said it was not a lyrically elaborate song, but that: [...] "mostly it's about phonics. It's about words that sing great. I was mumbling something, and those <b>words</b> <b>came</b> out." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sino-Japanese {{conflict}} (193145) {{gave the}} Great Wall {{a new lease}} {{of life in the}} eyes of the Chinese. During the 1933 defence of the Great Wall, inadequately-equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of Japanese troops for several months. Using the cover of the Great Wall, the Chinese – who were at times only armed with broadswords – were able to beat off a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment. With the Chinese forces eventually overrun, the subsequent Tanggu Truce stipulated that the Great Wall was to become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Even so, the determined defence of the Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness of the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked up this symbol in his poetry during his [...] "Long March" [...] escaping from Kuomintang prosecution. Near the end of the trek in 1935, Mao wrote the poem [...] "Mount Liupan" [...] that contains the well-known line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present day: [...] "Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men" [...] (...) [...] Another noteworthy reference to the Great Wall is in the song [...] "The March of the Volunteers", whose <b>words</b> <b>came</b> from a stanza in Tian Han's 1934 poem entitled [...] "The Great Wall". The song, originally from the anti-Japanese movie Children of Troubled Times, enjoyed continued popularity in China and was selected as the provisional national anthem of the People's Republic of China (PRC) at its establishment in 1949.|$|E

2500|$|The First Opium War, {{also known}} as the First Anglo-Chinese War, was ended in 1842 with the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, which forced the Qing {{government}} to open Fuzhou to all British traders and missionaries.

Consequently, some English <b>words</b> <b>came</b> into Fuzhou dialect, but without fixed written forms in Chinese characters. The most frequently used words are listed below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Louis Albert Bowman, an {{attorney}} from Illinois, {{was the first}} to suggest the addition of [...] "under God" [...] to the pledge. The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution gave him an Award of Merit as the originator of this idea. He spent his adult life in the Chicago area and was chaplain of the Illinois Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. At a meeting on February 12, 1948, he led the society in reciting the pledge with the two words [...] "under God" [...] added. He said that the <b>words</b> <b>came</b> from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Although not all manuscript versions of the Gettysburg Address contain the words [...] "under God", all the reporters' transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps Lincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he said [...] "that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom." [...] Bowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.|$|E

2500|$|Luckinbill's musical ability was {{utilized}} in J.T. and Colleen's storyline. He {{stated that the}} writers and producers felt {{like it would be}} a good idea. He added: [...] "They wanted me to sing a song by Alison Krauss called, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". I liked it, was sitting at home one night working on that song and this new song just came about." [...] The new song Luckinbill wrote was entitled [...] "Feel". In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If he were going to write her a song, what would he write? And these <b>words</b> <b>came</b> out. I ended up writing a song that night, which I took to our producers and said, 'I know you want me to sing this song, but how do you feel about this one? It's character driven.'" [...] Smith decided Luckinbill would sing both [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". Luckinbill sang Krauss' song on the episode dated December 26, 2002, where J.T. serenades Colleen on her sixteenth birthday. Smith wrote a scene specifically for the song Luckinbill wrote, featuring J.T. playing his guitar at Colleen's Valentine's Day dance where he performed [...] "Feel". After J.T. cheats on Colleen with Anita, Luckinbill wrote an untitled song in character for the show and performed it in character on the episode dated July 24, 2003.|$|E
