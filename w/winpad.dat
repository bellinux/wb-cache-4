500|$|Microsoft's work on {{handheld}} {{portable devices}} began with research projects in 1990, {{with the work}} on [...] Windows CE beginning in 1992. Initially, the OS and the user interface were developed separately. With Windows CE being based on Windows 95 code and a separate team handing the user interface which was codenamed <b>WinPad</b> (later Microsoft At Work for Handhelds). Windows 95 had strong pen support making porting easy; with some saying [...] "At this time, Windows 95 offers outstanding pen support. It is treating pens right for the first time." [...] <b>WinPad</b> was delayed due to price and performance issues, before being scrapped in early 1995 due to touchscreen driver problems relating to WriteTouch technology, made by NCR Microelectronic Products. Although <b>WinPad</b> was never released as a consumer product, Alpha builds were released showcasing many interface elements. During development of <b>WinPad</b> a separate team worked on a project called Pulsar; {{designed to be a}} mobile communications version of <b>WinPad,</b> described as a [...] "pager on Steroids". This project was also canceled around the same time as <b>WinPad.</b> The two disbanded groups would form the Pegasus project in 1995. Pegasus would work on the hardware side of the Windows CE OS, attempting to create a form factor similar to a PC-esque PDA like <b>WinPad,</b> with communications functionality like Pulsar. A hardware reference guide was created and devices began shipping in 1996, although most of these device bore little resemblance to the goal of a pen-based touchscreen handheld device.|$|E
