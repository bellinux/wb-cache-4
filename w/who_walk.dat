Inspectors <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> the track are {{the eyes and}} ears of the railway.

5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to restricting photography of public art, closing {{a public park}} for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, {{as one of the}} park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT Plaza from 6a.m. to 11p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> through the park were forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that the money would help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to {{what looks like a}} baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At {{the beginning of the}} video, noises from the city can be heard, a camera passes Lowe on the street, and focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E

25|$|The Van Wickle Gates, {{dedicated}} on June 18, 1901, have a pair {{of smaller}} side gates that are open year-round, and a large central gate that is opened two days a year for Convocation and Commencement. At Convocation the gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students. At Commencement the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates. A Brown superstition is that students <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backwards is said to cancel the hex.

500|$|In his {{biography}} of Stanley Kubrick, author John Baxter traces Kubrick's {{interest in science}} fiction films, which led to his , to the Japanese kaiju eiga films of the 1950s, including Warning from Space, with its [...] "nameless two-metre-tall black starfish with a single central eye, <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> en pointe like ballet dancers." [...] Baxter notes that despite their [...] "clumsy model sequences, the films were often well-photographed in colour ... and their dismal dialogue was delivered in well-designed and well-lit sets." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} {{violence}} and the abuse of power, {{as well as of}} coming of age. The protagonists have a recurring struggle to make choices they are comfortable with. Their moral development takes place within the harshness of the Upland culture, contrasted with examples of kindness and altruism. It has been described as sharing themes of dreamworlds and choices with a number of other works by Le Guin, such as the Earthsea cycle, The Beginning Place, and [...] "The Ones <b>Who</b> <b>Walk</b> Away from Omelas". It also shares similarities with Maurice Sendak's book Where the Wild Things Are, while Orrec's transformation in the novel has been compared to the biblical story of Jonah.|$|E

500|$|In her video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games (2013–2017), feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian criticises Resident Evil for sexualising its {{alternate}} costumes for women, citing as {{an example}} Valentine's pirate costume in the game Resident Evil: Revelations (2012). She also cites Valentine's movement in the game {{as an example}} of female characters <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> in an overly sexualised manner. Valentine's first appearance in the film Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) is of her legs in a miniskirt, and the camera frequently follows her from behind. Commentators have noted that her body shape is unrealistic and does not reflect her physical training, and she was the only member of her team in the original game not to wear a bulletproof vest. Video-game journalist Bob Mackey described her miniskirt outfit in Resident Evil 3 (1999) as an [...] "embarrassing relic" [...] from a period that catered to teenage boys.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitutional}} changes {{which occurred}} {{immediately after the}} revolution were probably not as extensive as the legends suggest, {{as the most important}} constitutional change probably concerned the chief executive. Before the revolution, a king (rex) was elected by the senators (patres or [...] "fathers") for a life term, but now two Praetores ("leaders") were elected by the citizens for an annual term. These magistrates were eventually called [...] "Consuls" [...] (Latin for those <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> together), and each Consul checked his colleague, while their limited term in office opened them up to prosecution if they abused the powers of their office. The chief executive was still vested with the same grade of imperium ("command") powers as was the old king, and the powers of each of the two Consuls, when exercised together, were no different than were those of the old king. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} revolution, the Roman Senate and the Roman assemblies were nearly as powerless as they had been under the monarchy.|$|E
500|$|The {{novels and}} other fictional works {{set in the}} Hainish {{universe}} recount the efforts to re-establish a galactic civilization.

[...] "Vaster than Empires" [...] is set soon after the formation of the League of All Worlds, {{at a time when the}} League is still sending out exploratory ships to investigate new planets. [...] "Vaster than Empires", like other works such as The Word for World Is Forest and [...] "The Ones <b>Who</b> <b>Walk</b> Away from Omelas" [...] explore worlds that have gone wrong in some way. The title of the story is taken from a poem by Andrew Marvell, titled [...] "To His Coy Mistress". The line from which the title is derived reads [...] "Our vegetable love should grow/Vaster than empires, and more slow." [...] In the internal chronology of the Hainish cycle, [...] "Vaster than Empires" [...] takes place after The Dispossessed and before The Word for World is Forest.|$|E
