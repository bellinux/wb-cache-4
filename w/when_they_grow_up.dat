2500|$|King Charles I Robert endeavoured the {{implementation}} of the ideas of chivalry; in 1318, he established the Order of Saint George whose membership was limited to 50 knights. He also set up the body of [...] "knights-at-the-court" [...] ( [...] , [...] ) who acted as his personal delegates on an ad hoc basis. Thenceforward, most of the [...] "barons of the realm" [...] were appointed among the knights-at-the court. Before being knighted, children of the upper nobility could serve as pages ( [...] , [...] ) in the Royal Households, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> they became [...] "juveniles-at-the court" [...] ( [...] , [...] ). King Charles I Robert was the first king of Hungary who granted crests to his followers; the Hungarian word for coat-of-arms (címer) derives from the French expression for the crest (cimier).|$|E

2500|$|In The Creation of Patriarchy by Gerda Lerner, {{the author}} states that Aristotle {{believed}} that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle {{believed to be}} perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that [...] "soul contributes the form and model of creation." [...] This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must {{be caused by a}} woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Jim Esch, {{the opener}} [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice" [...] inaugurates and suggests the album's pervasive theme: [...] "fragile lovers buckling {{under the pressure}} of external forces they can't control, self-imposed romantic expectations and personal limitations, while simultaneously trying to maintain faith in one other. It is a theme that keeps reverberating sweetly, and hauntingly, throughout Pet Sounds." [...] Carl said: [...] "The disappointment and the loss of innocence that everyone had to go through <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> and find everything's not Hollywood are the recurrent themes on that album." [...] Critics Richard Goldstein and Nik Cohn noted incongruity between the album's music and lyrics, where the latter suggested the work to be [...] "sad songs about happiness" [...] while also celebrating loneliness and heartache. In the opinion of Perone, it is the next track, [...] "You Still Believe in Me", which features the first expression of introspective themes that pervade the rest of the album.|$|E
2500|$|Susan Corrigan from I-D {{had said}} {{positively}} stated that [...] "Too Far" [...] "shimmer". Robin Bresnek from Melody Maker had discussed their parent review, {{and said that}} [...] "Too Far" [...] and [...] "Drunk" [...] were immediate highlights for Minogue showing her [...] "schizophrenic self-disgust" [...] nature that [...] "spins dizzily {{in the shadow of}} fluttering heartbeats and inspired rushes of sound." [...] Sam Upton from Select magazine was particularly positive towards the track, saying [...] "'Too Far' sets out the stall perfectly with beats that want to be jungle <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> and Kylie slipping between half-rap and the usual sensual breathing's." [...] Upton, however, gave the parent album an overall mixed review. Larry Flick from Billboard commented [...] "From the haunting, almost unsettling drum'n'bass undertow of the set's lead cut, [...] "Too Far," [...] it's clear that the days of kewpie-doll ditties like [...] "The Loco-Motion" [...] and [...] "Better the Devil You Know" [...] have dissolved into a gratefully distant memory." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{feeling of}} a FATHER to his child, again, you find is fainter still among beasts.

60|$|He {{reflected}} on {{it a good}} deal during the day, and, running across Sigsbee, a fellow Cape Pleasanter, after dinner {{that night at the}} Sybarites' Club, he spoke of the matter to him. It so happened that both had dined excellently, and were looking on the world with a sort of cosy benevolence. They were in the mood when men pat small boys on the head and ask them if they mean to be President <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

50|$|Children wore no {{clothing}} until 6 years old. Once {{they turned}} {{six years old}} {{they were allowed to}} wear clothing to protect them from the dry heat.

I don't really believe that the story is true; but if it is true, this is the very place where the basket, with the two babies in it, must have drifted along." ...|$|R

"While {{the organs}} {{are young and}} pliable," [...] the lady remarked, [...] "I regard it as of great {{importance}} to practice children {{in the art of}} reading aloud, with an agreeable variety of tone and correctness of emphasis.

All the way riding from the station back to the ranch, he kept pulling that decree {{out of his pocket and}} laying his finger on the back of it and reading off to me the sum and substance of it.

Another skit explored parential separation and divorce, featuring a young bird whose parents live in different trees; the song [...] "They Live in Different Places, But They Both Love Me" [...] was used to reinforce the moral.|$|R
60|$|How {{much more}} {{deceitful}} than her lover {{is the little}} nursery governess. The moment she comes into sight {{she looks at the}} post-office and sees him. Then she looks straight before her, and now she is observed, and he rushes across to her in a glory, and she starts--positively starts--as if he had taken her by surprise. Observe her hand rising suddenly to her wicked little heart. This is the moment when I stir my coffee violently. He gazes down at her in such rapture that he is in everybody's way, and as she takes his arm she gives it a little squeeze, and then away they strut, Mary doing nine-tenths of the talking. I fall to wondering what they will look like <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now {{though the}} Christian names which we give our {{children}} here in England, have no especial meaning to them, and {{have nothing to}} do with what we expect or wish the children to be <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> yet the names of people in most other countries in the world have. The Jewish names which we find in the Bible have almost all of them a meaning. So Simeon, I believe, means 'Obedient'; Jehoshaphat means, 'The Lord will judge'; Daniel, 'God is my judge'; Isaiah means, 'The Salvation of the Lord'; Isaac means, 'She laughs,' as a memorial of Sarah's laughing, when she heard that she was to have a child; Ishmael means, 'The Lord hears,' in remembrance of God's hearing Hagar's cry in the wilderness, when Ishmael was dying of thirst.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Hodder, I simply can't see {{any reason}} for resorting to a {{physical}} miracle in order to explain a spiritual mystery. I can see why the ancients demanded a sign of divinity as it were. But for us it has ceased even to be that. It can't be proved. You ask me, {{in the face of}} overwhelming evidence against it, to teach my children that the Incarnation depends on it, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> and go to college and find it discredited they run the risk of losing everything else with it. And for my part, I fail utterly to see why, if with God all things are possible, it isn't quite as believable, as we gather from St. Mark's Gospel, that he incarnated himself in one naturally born. If you reach the conclusion that Jesus was not a mere individual human person, you reach it through the contemplation of his life and death." ...|$|E
