40|$|This study {{examined}} aggressive behavior between the colonies in the ter-mite Reticulitermes chinensis from China. Strong aggression was observed among <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> soldiers. Intercolonial aggression was strong {{during the first}} 0. 5 h and then reduced gradually in all the treatments. After cut-ting the five terminal antennal segments of <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> soldiers, there was still strong intercolonial aggression among <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> soldiers. However, after removal of the ten terminal antennal segments of <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> soldiers, almost no intercolonial aggression happened among <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> soldiers. SEM results of antennae indicated that antennal sensillae mainly occurred on the ten terminal segments including four types of trichode sensilla, both in <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> soldiers of this species. Few antennal sensilla occurred on the basal segments {{except for a few}} sensilla chaetica and basiconic capitate peg sensilla. The above findings suggest that antennal sensillae {{may play a role in}} nestmate recognition in R. chinensis...|$|R

40|$|Job {{satisfaction}} {{reflects the}} on-the-job utility of <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> {{has been found}} to influence both the behavior of <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> the productivity of firms. Performance pay remains popular and widely used to increase <b>worker</b> productivity <b>and</b> more generally align the objectives of <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> firms. Yet, its impact on job satisfaction is ambiguous. Whereas the increased earnings increase job satisfaction, the increased effort and risk decreases job satisfaction. This paper finds empirical evidence that on net performance pay increases job satisfaction but does so largely among union <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> males in larger firms. Copyright 2008 The Author.
