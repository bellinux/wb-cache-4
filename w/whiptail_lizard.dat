25|$|Parthenogenesis {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} in the New Mexico whiptail in the genus Cnemidophorus (also known as Aspidoscelis) of which 15 species reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis. These lizards live in the dry and sometimes harsh climate of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. All these asexual species appear to have arisen through the hybridization {{of two or three}} of the sexual species in the genus leading to polyploid individuals. The mechanism by which the mixing of chromosomes from two or three species can lead to parthenogenetic reproduction is unknown. Recently, a hybrid parthenogenetic <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizard</b> was bred in the laboratory from a cross between an asexual and a sexual whiptail. Because multiple hybridization events can occur, individual parthenogenetic whiptail species can consist of multiple independent asexual lineages. Within lineages, there is very little genetic diversity, but different lineages may have quite different genotypes.|$|E

2500|$|... is a [...] {{wildlife}} sanctuary {{based on a}} [...] wetland built by the City of El Paso in 1969 as a stormwater-retention basin. Since 1976, the El Paso/Trans-Pecos Audubon Society has leased this land {{from the city and}} managed it for wildlife. Over 200 different species of birds, especially those associated with water, have been observed at the sanctuary. Fauna residing there include muskrats, spiny softshell turtles, pond sliders, and Trans-Pecos striped <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizards</b> are entirely female and no males are known. These all-female species {{reproduce}} by obligate parthenogenesis (obligate, because the lizards {{do not involve}} males and cannot reproduce sexually). Like all squamate obligate parthenogenetic lineages, parthenogenetic Teiids are hybrids. Two or more species rarely hybridize and the offspring are thought to occasionally be capable of reproduction without sperm. The meiotic mechanism for bypassing fertilization is an ongoing area of research.|$|R

5000|$|The desert {{grassland}} <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizard</b> (Aspidoscelis uniparens) is an all-female {{species of}} reptiles. It was formerly {{placed in the}} genus Cnemidophorus. A. uniparens have limited social stimuli, having only two basic needs: finding food and avoiding predators. A common predator of the <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizard</b> is the leopard lizard, that prey on A. uniparens by using ambush and stalk haunting tactics. These reptiles reproduce by parthenogenesis. In this process, eggs undergo a chromosome doubling after meiosis, developing into lizards without being fertilized. However, ovulation is enhanced by female-female courtship and [...] "mating" [...] (pseudo-copulation) rituals that resemble the behavior of closely related species that reproduce sexually.|$|E
50|$|Indigenous {{reptiles}} {{include the}} cascabel (Crotalus durissus unicolor), the santanero or (Aruban) Baker's cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira bakeri), and the kododo blauw or Aruban <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cnemidophorus arubensis).

5000|$|Thelytoky (from the Greek thÄ“lys [...] "female" [...] and tokos [...] "birth") {{is a type}} of {{parthenogenesis}} {{in which}} females are produced from unfertilized eggs, as for example in aphids. Thelytokous parthenogenesis is rare among animals and reported in about 1,500 species, about 1 in 1000 of described animal species, according to a 1984 study. It is more common in invertebrates, like arthropods, but it can occur in vertebrates, including salamanders, fish, and reptiles such as some <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Trans-Pecos {{spotted whiptail}} is gray or black in color, with {{six to eight}} yellow or white stripes which run along the body from head to tail. Unlike other species of <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizards,</b> they have no {{spotting}} between their stripes. Their undersides are white or pale blue in color, and often they have light blue {{on the sides of}} their heads and tails. They are thin-bodied, and have a tail that is typically almost three times the length of their bodies.|$|R
50|$|The insect's {{coloration}} {{was shown}} to be aposematic in an experiment of predation by little striped <b>whiptail</b> <b>lizards.</b> These brightly-colored grasshoppers were less attractive to the lizards as food than cryptically-colored Trimerotropis sp of similar size, even though the lizards were unfamiliar with the rainbow grasshopper, which was not present in their natural habitat. The lizards may previously have encountered other prey with warning colors such as stink bugs, seed bugs, or velvet ants. The rainbow grasshopper is also distasteful to birds.|$|R
