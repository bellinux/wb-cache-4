5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} progressively {{more critical of}} Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E

The total number of volunteer rescue personnel in Leninakan totalled 2,000, with teams from Austria, Canada, Switzerland, the United States and Yugoslavia.

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, Nazi Germany made {{increasingly}} aggressive territorial demands, threatening war {{if they were not}} met. It seized Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939. Hitler made a non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, or shot.|$|E

He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of Les Misérables, and was soon entrusted with larger parts including Banquo in Macbeth and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{reports that}} Xerxes sent his {{commander}} Hydarnes that evening, {{with the men}} under his command, the Immortals, to encircle the Greeks via the path. However, he does not say who those men were. The Immortals had been bloodied on the first day, so {{it is possible that}} Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the Immortals; according to Diodorus, Hydarnes had a force of 20,000 for the mission. The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Malian Gulf at Alpenus, the first town of Locris.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Fleetwood {{moved to}} London with Virginie {{and their son}} Louis. He rarely visited Lancashire again, and in 1847 he retired from politics. The family spent some time living in Virginie's home country, Spain. In 1861 Hesketh-Fleetwood {{expressed}} an intention to return to politics, but was prevented from doing so by his failing health. He died {{at his home in}} Piccadilly, London on 12 April 1866, following a lengthy illness. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His son Rev. Peter Louis Hesketh-Fleetwood (1838–1880) succeeded to the baronetcy, which became extinct on his death. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> Hesketh-Fleetwood's land in Lancashire was bought by the Fleetwood Estate Company in 1875.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the rest}} of Sikkim, not much {{is known about the}} early history of Gangtok. The {{earliest}} records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 2003 the {{pavilion}} at the pierhead caught fire. Fire crews {{were unable to}} save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. The cause of the fire remains unknown, since fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons, although it {{is thought to have}} been arson. A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March the {{division}} {{was ordered to}} proceed to the coast at Qui Nhơn for evacuation.

At 02:00 on 1 April, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the division was extracted by sea. Two regimental colonels, after being ordered to evacuate, refused to leave, preferring suicide rather than retreat or surrender. The division's third regiment, the 47th, ran into an ambush at Phu Cat and suffered heavy casualties, losing about half of its troops. When it later regrouped at Vũng Tàu, the 22nd numbered only slightly over 2,000 men, its commander also having chosen suicide over surrender.|$|E

In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, {{where most of the}} nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam’s territory, so the military had to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Kateri i Radës {{were transported}} to a {{concrete}} platform {{in the port}} of Otranto as {{a monument to the}} tragedy. The project cost €150 thousand and was entrusted to the Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos. Before the project, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the ship lay {{in a corner of the}} port of Brindisi. The project was titled L'Approdo. Opera all'Umanità Migrante (The Landing. A work dedicated to Migrating Humanity). Photographers Arta Ngucaj and Arben Beqiraj published photographs of the ship on the Albanian-Italian newspaper Shqiptari i Italisë. The families of the dead requested for the relics of Kateri i Radës to be placed in Albania after Italian media reported that it was to be used as a monument.|$|E
5|$|Plans were {{formulated}} on 6 September {{to transport}} the British 1st Airborne Division to Taranto from their base in North Africa.

5|$|That the Germans {{had used}} gas {{chambers}} was confirmed on 23 July 1944, when the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin, Poland, {{was captured by}} Soviet soldiers, with its gas chambers intact and 820,000 shoes. Auschwitz itself was liberated by the 28th and 106th corps of the 1st Ukrainian Front of the Red Army on 27 January 1945.

5|$|This dual rule {{eventually}} {{failed and}} the two waged a new civil war further diminishing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> Byzantium's integrity {{in the eyes of}} her troublesome neighbors. John VI Cantacuzenus emerged triumphant once again and replaced the now exiled John V Palaeologus with his son Matthew Cantacuzenus as junior co-emperor. However, the Turks, under Osman I's son, Orhan I, now came into play by capturing the fort of Kallipolis (Gallipoli) in 1354 and gaining access to the European mainland. The arrival of the seemingly unbeatable Ottoman soldiers surrounding Constantinople caused a panic in Constantinople, capitalized by John V who, {{with the assistance of the}} Genoese, staged a coup and ousted John VI Cantacuzenus in November 1354. As a result, John VI would later become a monk.|$|E
