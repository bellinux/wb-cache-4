40|$|In this study, the {{application}} of fresh-wood-wool without any pre-treatment to produce <b>wood-wool</b> cement boards (WWCB) is investigated. The {{aim of this study}} is to create a binder which is less affected by the inhibitory substances of the <b>wood-wool,</b> without reducing the flexural strength properties of the boards. Moreover, the carbon footprint of WWCB is addressed by not using any waterglass and partly replacing cement with limestone powder in the boards production. First, the hydration behavior of different binders is studied by means of an isothermal calorimeter, including e. g. different types of cement, addition of glucose as a retarder, reduced anhydrite content in OPC and the use of limestone powder as a partial cement replacement. Then, boards are produced with fresh <b>wood-wool</b> and a newly developed binder recipe that is resulted from the hydration behavior analysis. The results show that the retarding effect of glucose is highly dependent on the chemical composition of the cement. In general, high amounts of C 3 A and C 3 S in a binder are favorable. When available, glucose reacts first with C 3 A, hence, less glucose is available to retard the other cement compounds like C 3 S. In addition, when using the fresh <b>wood-wool</b> in boards, the strength of the produced boards is increased. Furthermore, the water absorption of the wood is significantly reduced (20 %), since it is already physically and chemically bound within the <b>wood-wool.</b> This enables a lower water demand that results in a denser packing of the binder and a reduced ion migration, leading to a mechanical strength increase. Furthermore, without the use of waterglass and the incorporation of limestone powder (36 %) as a partial cement replacement, the CO 2 footprint of the developed board fulfills the stated requirements, while possessing a reduced CO 2 footprint...|$|E

40|$|Behavioural and {{psychological}} needs of laboratory animals generally cannot adequately be met in standard laboratory cages. Environmental enrichment, {{which provides a}} more structured environment can enhance the well-being of laboratory animals.

Six different types of nesting materials were evaluated in a preference test with male and female animals of two strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J or BALB/c, n= 48).

Paper-derived materials were preferred over wood-derived materials, although the results also suggest that the nature (paper or wood) of the nesting material is less important than its structure, which determines the nestability of the material.

The daily behaviour of mice was video recorded and their body weight, food consumption, weights of some organs and serum corticosterone concentrations were measured. Aggressive interactions between cage mates and against a strange intruder {{as well as the}} number of wounds {{on the back of the}} animals was monitored in order to evaluate the effect of nesting material on intermale aggression. Nesting material did not affect the daily active/passive behaviour patterns of mice, although animals clearly preferred it as a resting place. BALB/c mice given nesting material showed less weight gain and smaller brown adipose tissue weights than animals without nesting material. The other characteristics measured were not affected by the presence of nesting material in either strain. The presence of nesting material had no effect on fighting in cages. CS 7 BL/ 6 J mice were more aggressive than BALB/c mice according to the number of wounded animals in a cage. Wounded BALB/c mice had enlarged spleens and decreased epididymal adipose tissue weights. In conclusion, the nesting material used in this study did not adversely affect the animals. On the other hand, the material was clearly preferred to conventional bedding as a resting place. These findings suggest that nesting material may improve the cage environment of laboratory mice. Furthermore, there was an indication of strain differences in aggressive behaviour. It could be suggested that C 57 BL/ 6 J mice are less tolerant towards intruders and housing six mice per cage is not suitable for this strain...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{investigation}} of the structural behavior of wallettes made from <b>wood-wool</b> cement composite panel (WWCP). Initially, a series of experimental test were carried out to investigate the mechanical properties of WWCP namely density, bending properties (MOR and MOE), compressive strength and tensile strength for two thicknesses of WWCP (50 mm and 100 mm). Then, the axial compression capacity of WWCP was investigated using wallettes. In the fabrication of wallettes, {{there are two types of}} panel arrangement considered and denoted as W 1 and W 2. For W 1, 100 mm thick WWCP was used and cut into size of 300 mm width and 600 mm length. The cut panels were then stacked vertically (two layer) in running bond pattern to form a 600 mm x 600 mm wallettes. The top and bottom panels were connected together with 10 mm thick mortar paste and three vertical steel bars were inserted between panels. In addition to this, an enhancement has been made by fixed two U-Nail at the connection area on each side of wallettes. For W 2, a new panel arrangement technique has been proposed by integrating two layers of 50 mm thickness of WWCP (cut into size of 300 mm width and 600 mm length) with different orientation of panel arrangement to form a 600 mm x 600 mm wallettes. The front side of the panels has been arranged in the longitudinal direction, whereas back side in transverse direction. The front and back side panels were bonded together using either adhesive or mortar mix with different thicknesses to form approximately 100 mm (± 15 mm) thick wall. For mechanical properties of WWCP, it was found that, the strength properties of the panel decreases with the increased in panel thickness. For the axial compression test of wallettes, the results showed that, a new proposed of panel arrangement technique with mortar mix significantly improved the stability as well as increased load carrying capacity of wallettes...|$|E
