40|$|The rate {{of second}} layer {{nucleation}} [...] {{the formation of}} a stable nucleus on top of a two-dimensional island [...] determines both the conditions for layer-by-layer growth, {{and the size of the}} top terrace of multilayer mounds in three-dimensional homoepitaxial growth. It was recently shown that conventional mean field nucleation theory overestimates the rate of second layer nucleation by a factor that is proportional to the number of times a given site is visited by an adatom during its residence time on the island. In the presence of strong step edge barriers this factor can be large, leading to a substantial error in previous attempts to experimentally determine barrier energies from the onset of second layer nucleation. In the first part of the paper simple analytic estimates of second layer nucleation rates based on a comparison of the relevant time scales will be reviewed. In the main part the theory of second layer nucleation is applied to the growth of multilayer mounds in the presence of strong but finite step edge barriers. The shape of the mounds is obtained by numerical integration of the deterministic evolution of island boundaries, supplemented by a rule for nucleation in the top layer. For thick films the shape converges to a simple scaling solution. The scaling function is parametrized by the coverage θ_c of the top layer, and takes the form of an inverse error function cut off at θ_c. The surface <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> of thickness d is √((1 - θ_c) d). Finally, we show that the scaling solution can be derived also from a continuum growth equation.

40|$|This work is {{specially}} {{contributes to}} the knowledge {{in the field of}} efficient removal of entrained micron size liquid drops from air mist in a centrifugal field using bimetallic and bi-surface (low and high energy) porous discs. The available equipment was suitably modified, commissioned and utilised in this investigation. The variables investigated include: different rotational speeds; various air and liquid flow-rates; three materials of construction and five porosities of the rotating porous discs. The average residence time of two-phase two-component flow of fine air mist through the rotating porous disc was in the range of 0. 7 ms to 3. 0 ms. A high-resolution and magnification optical method has been used to record, explain and understand the mechanism of wettability of the bi-metal and bi-surface energy porous discs. Navier-Stokes equations of momentum have been used to develop a mathematical model to predict the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liquid <b>film</b> formed on top of the rotating porous disc. The predictions of the model compared very favorably with the experimental data. The final empirical equations that represents the separation efficiency, (45 to near 100...|$|R

40|$|Two {{dimensional}} film system bears many exotic thermodynamics behaviors. We {{proposed a}} mathematical physics model {{to explore how}} the melting temperature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two dimensional mathematical dimer film depends on the odd-eveness <b>of</b> the finite <b>width</b> <b>of</b> dimer <b>film.</b> <b>A</b> weak external bond between dimers is introduced into the classical dimer model in this dimer <b>film.</b> We derived <b>a</b> general equation <b>of</b> melting temperature and applied it for computing the melting temperature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dimer <b>film</b> covering <b>a</b> finite square lattice. The melting temperature {{is proportional to the}} external bonding energy that we assume it binds neighboring dimers together and proportional to the inverse of entropy per site. Further more, it shows fusing two small rectangular dimer film with odd number of length into one big rectangular film gains more entropy than fusing two small rectangles with even number of length into the same big rectangle. Fusing two small toruses with even number of length into one big torus reduces entropy. Fusing two small toruses with odd number of length increases the entropy. Thus two dimer films with even number of length repel each other, two dimer films with odd length attract each other. The odd-even effect is also reflected on the correlation function of two topologically distinguishable loops in a torus surface. The entropy of finite system dominates odd-even effect. This model has straightforward extension to longer polymers and three dimensional systems. Comment: 10 pages in two column, 15 figures in Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 201...|$|R
