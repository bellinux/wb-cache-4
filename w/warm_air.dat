5|$|<b>Warm</b> <b>air</b> : Exposition {{of seeds}} to <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> (50 to 70°C, {{depending}} duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into the seeds {{at the same}} time it lowers water content. However, warmth can decrease germination rates of the seeds and degrade the visual aspect and the protein content of the seeds, which would be problematic for the seed market.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E

50|$|A {{warm front}} is also {{defined as the}} {{transition}} zone where a <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> mass is replacing a cooler <b>air</b> mass. <b>Warm</b> fronts generally move from southwest to northeast. If the <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> originates over the ocean, {{it is not only}} warmer but also more moist than the air ahead of it.|$|R

5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> and rapidly lifts the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E

50|$|When {{masses of}} air with {{different}} density (moisture and temperature characteristics) meet, less dense <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> overrides colder <b>air.</b> The <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> {{is forced to}} rise and if conditions are right becomes saturated, causing precipitation. In turn, precipitation can enhance the temperature and moisture contrast along a frontal boundary. Passing weather fronts cause sudden changes in general temperature, and in the humidity and pressure {{in the air at}} ground level.|$|R

5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> from the tropics.|$|E

500|$|The {{dry line}} is the {{boundary}} between dry and moist air masses east of mountain ranges with similar orientation to the Rockies, depicted {{at the leading edge}} of the dew point, or moisture, gradient. Near the surface, <b>warm</b> moist <b>air</b> that is denser than <b>warmer,</b> dryer <b>air</b> wedges under the drier air in a manner similar to that of a cold front wedging under <b>warmer</b> <b>air.</b> When the <b>warm</b> moist <b>air</b> wedged under the drier mass heats up, it becomes less dense and rises and sometimes forms thunderstorms. [...] At higher altitudes, the <b>warm</b> moist <b>air</b> is less dense than the cooler, drier air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.|$|R
50|$|An {{aircraft}} can {{most easily}} evade freezing rain by moving into <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> — under most conditions, this would require aircraft to descend, {{which it can}} usually do safely and easily even with a moderate accumulation of structural ice. However, freezing rain {{is accompanied by a}} temperature inversion aloft, meaning that aircraft actually need to climb to move into <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> — a potentially difficult and dangerous task with even a small amount of ice accumulation.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below <b>warm</b> <b>air,</b> preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E
5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
50|$|These ice {{crystals}} usually form when a temperature inversion is {{present at the}} surface and the <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> above the ground mixes with the colder air near the surface. Since <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> frequently contains more water vapor than colder air, this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air near the surface, causing the relative humidity of the near-surface air to increase. If the relative humidity increase near the surface is large enough then {{ice crystals}} may form.|$|R

5|$|The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on {{the terrace}} {{overlooking}} the Great Bath are particularly susceptible {{to the effect of}} acid rain and are being protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years. Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|Bertha's broad {{circulation}} produced high waves {{which were}} reported along the southeastern {{coast of the}} United States, in North Carolina, the storm produced waves of 25–50ft (7.6-15.2m). The waves caused minor beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline including the Outer Banks. In Florida, rip currents from Bertha caused two drowning fatalities. 200other swimmers were rescued from the rough seas. The vortex of Bertha forced <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> and blocked sea breezes from South Florida. As a result, record high temperatures were reported in West Palm Beach, Miami, Hollywood, and Miami Beach; temperatures also tied records in Fort Lauderdale. The extreme heat also shattered numerous sliding glass doors and exhausted several air conditioners.|$|E

5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. <b>Warm</b> <b>air</b> containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key to the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> would do.|$|E
