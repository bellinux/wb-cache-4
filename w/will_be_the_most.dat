Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed flying fox is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> beneficial at the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient is defined at a specified temperature and, if applicable, pH of the aqueous phase. Partition coefficients {{are very important}} in pharmacology because they {{determine the extent to}} which a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which is like an organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E

As part of negotiations with the City of Windsor (who threatened legal action in pursuit of more tunneling and green space of the route), the province agreed to additional funding to infrastructure projects in Windsor-Essex; this includes money for the improvement to the plaza of the Canadian side of the Windsor-Detroit tunnel, the widening and other improvements of Walker Rd between Division Rd and E.C.
