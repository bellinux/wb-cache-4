30|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} and its related principles were recently re-analysed and {{incorporated into the}} new phrase “corporate sustainability management” (Schuler et al., 2017). Corporate sustainability management considers the demands and expectations of consumers, employees and partners of organizations, and establishes a correlation between these stakeholders’ activities and aspects influencing the environment. “Corporate sustainability management” has proven quite difficult to embrace, because of decision-makers’ reluctance to make changes, {{and the need to}} identify appropriate <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> into practice (Mulder, 2017). Employees must be trained regarding sustainability and social responsibility and how these principles can be correlated with the expectations of communities and society at large where retailers operate. Marketing-oriented organizations are willing to better satisfy customers’ needs (Green et al., 2015) because they have the know-how and the capacity to collect information about target segments; they also have the resources to identify swiftly and effectively the changes in customer behaviour and make the needed adjustments accordingly. Acting in line with the principles of the new “corporate sustainability management”, companies seek to redefine and restructure their offering by including green and environmentally friendly products and services (Baumgartner and Rauter, 2016).|$|R

40|$|This is {{the last}} in a three-part series of posts on the {{problematic}} aspects of the Government’s plan for local TV in the UK. Unlike the previous posts, which pointed out the lack of network support and overly ambitious expectations for content, no Dickensian literary reference was appropriate to title this one. The proposal, to use the digital terrestrial television (DTT) platform and create linear television stations across the UK, is already old fashioned enough. It is admirable to invest in local media, but new technology allows more innovative and more sustainable <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> doing <b>it.</b> <b>Putting</b> local TV onto DTT multiplexes (MUXs), even in a first stage as the Government proposes, is an unnecessary investment, and one that sets local television {{off on the wrong}} foot in terms of both sustainability and purpose...|$|R

He had this <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> things together; <b>it</b> was just his sound and it influenced a lot of people. I’ve even gone to the Black Ark with Eric Gale for that Negril (album) album; I remember myself and Val Douglas, we laid some tracks there, Eric Gale overdubbed stuff on there, but I honestly don’t remember what happened to it.” Lee Perry and his studio were also formative in creating the highly innovative reggae subgenre called dub, in which the producer/engineer becomes {{the focus of the}} music, manipulating a pre-recorded track and creating something entirely new using the mixing console as nothing less than an instrument. Perry worked with The Clash and Paul McCartney and his band Wings had recorded there between 1972 and 1979.|$|R
40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for a treatment of rights to be treatment against power with some concession to the responsibilities that a tutelary of rights enjoys. We owe it to legal philosophers of the Scholastic persuasion who recognized rights as the entitlements that allow a person to fulfill duties—whether these arise from nature or from contract. In this sense rights were subordinate to and enjoyed for the sake of duties that one had. One may debate this <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> things, but <b>it</b> had the marked advantage of clarity and showed the internal connection between rights and duties. Also in the scholastic anatomy of rights, there was such a thing as the “term” of the right—he against whom the right could be claimed, and therefore he or she upon whom a duty was incumbent to desist from transgressing the right of the tutelary. In this sense a “right to” was concomitantly “power against,” but power, in the sense of claim or entitlement. For the power to enforce, one had to look to what scholastic philosophers called the “title” of the right—and this could be natural law, positive law that, of course, included contracts...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Perry built {{a studio}} in his back yard, the Black Ark, to have more control over his {{productions}} and continued to produce notable musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Junior Byles, Junior Murvin, the Heptones, the Congos and Max Romeo. He also started the Black Art label, on which many of the productions from the studio appeared. With his own studio at his disposal, Perry's productions became more lavish, as the energetic producer was able {{to spend as much}} time as he wanted on the music he produced. Virtually everything Perry recorded in The Black Ark was done using basic recording equipment; through sonic sleight-of-hand, Perry made it sound unique.

40|$|International audienceEnglish for Specific Purposes (ESP) is a {{specialist}} area of language teaching research that should benefit from corpus linguistics. Theory from corpus linguistics, {{such as the}} idiom principle (Sinclair 1987) can provide a powerful challenge to the intuitive areas of language use that have traditionally been of concern in the ESP syllabus (Sager et al. 1990). This paper marries a major theoretical backbone of ESP, the ethnographic approach of genre analysis (Swales 1990) to the large scale computational analysis of phraseology in a representative corpus. The hypothesis explored in this paper is that written science is founded on a system of preferred expressions, and that collocation is a fundamental mechanism that allows for new formulations to take place throughout the text. On the basis of Johns and King's (1990) and Barlow's' (forthcoming) work on corpus-driven learning, I argue here that ESP is enhanced by an increased awareness of prototypical patterns and {{from the fact that}} deviation from the pattern is a key dynamic mechanism for the genre. Science is increasingly no longer seen as a body of facts transmitted via language, but as a special linguistic construct, mediated by the mechanisms of textual reformulation and phraseological innovation. Students of science should be aware of this process, and should be able to exploit the computational characterisation of normal expressions, that is: prototypes or 'preferred <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> saying things'. <b>Putting</b> <b>it</b> simply, new collocations are new scientific ideas, and knowing what constitutes a new collocation is a fundamental process in the acquisition of an ESP...|$|R
