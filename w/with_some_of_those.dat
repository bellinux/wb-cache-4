25|$|The Oxus {{treasure}} (Persian: گنجینه آمودریا) is {{a collection}} of about 180 surviving pieces of metalwork in gold and silver, the majority rather small, plus perhaps about 200 coins, from the Achaemenid Persian period which were found by the Oxus river about 1877-1880. The exact place and date of the find remain unclear, and it is likely that many other pieces from the hoard were melted down for bullion; early reports suggest there were originally some 1500 coins, and mention types of metalwork that are not among the surviving pieces. The metalwork is believed to date from the sixth to fourth centuries BC, but the coins show a greater range, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> believed to belong to the treasure coming from around 200 BC. The most likely origin for the treasure is that it belonged to a temple, where votive offerings were deposited over a long period. How it came to be deposited is unknown.|$|E

25|$|There were {{conditions}} to who the CIA wanted to enlist, {{and they had}} specific uses that they wanted out of the Cubans that they brought aboard to the Cuban Opposition Front. They were supposed to restore the Cuban constitution that was made in 1940, they must be pro-Western and anti-Communist, they must be relatively politically neutral, {{and be able to}} gather other Cuban's support. Their purpose was summarized to three points, a beacon to attract other anti-Castro groups, a scapegoat in case covert operations were discovered, and to act as a potential replacement to Castro after his fall. As early as June 1960, there were 500 Cuban exiles being trained as paramilitary members in order to execute the Bay of Pigs, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> exiles being trained in Panama. This was due, partially, to the Soviet Union and its increasing amount of weaponry, along with a much larger influence of the Communist Party in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and {{were added to the}} local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while the women would spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), sour dock (Rumex arcticus), wild celery (Angelica lucida), wild lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), wild parsnip (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (Ranunculus pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|E
25|$|Opposition to the Chávez {{government}} was then particularly strong, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who were previously {{in the government}} before the election of Chávez. The independent media became the primary check on Chávez after he had taken control {{of most of the}} Venezuelan government, with the Venezuelan media acting like other forms of media in Latin America at the time that demanded accountability for governmental abuses and exposing corruption. The opposition was worried with Chávez because they believed his rewriting Venezuela's constitution were signs that Chávez was trying to maintain power through authoritarianism. In early 2002, there were also increasing signs of discontent in the military; in February four military officials, including a general and a rear admiral, publicly called on Chávez to resign. On 7 February 2002 Venezuela Air Force Colonel Pedro Vicente Soto and National Reserve Captain Pedro Flores Rivero led a rally protesting the Chávez government's allegedly undemocratic and authoritarian practices. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina Tamayo said on television that if Chávez did not resign, he should be impeached. Besides the opposition accusations that Chávez was undermining democracy and free speech, the military's complaints included Plan Bolívar 2000's use of the armed forces for poverty reduction activities instead of national defense. They also said Chávez was alienating the United States through a foreign policy involving negotiations with Colombian rebels and strengthening links with OPEC countries considered enemies of the United States, including Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Chávez and his allies suggested other motives, including Soto's being passed over for promotion, and pointed to a report in The Washington Post alleging that Soto and Tamayo had received $100,000 each from Miami bank accounts in return for denouncing Chávez.|$|E
