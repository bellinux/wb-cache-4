5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the <b>whole</b> <b>region</b> with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements in the area are thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
5|$|The city, which {{suffered}} from fires {{caused by the}} Pecheneg siege, surrendered upon seeing the main Polish army on August 14. The entering forces, led by Bolesław, were ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and Vladimir's family: On 14 August, the city received Boleslav and Sventipolk , its long-absent lord. Thereafter, through his favour, and from fear of us, the <b>whole</b> <b>region</b> was brought into submission. When they arrived, the archbishop of that city received them, at the church of St Sophia, with relics of the saints {{and other kinds of}} ceremonial apparatus.|$|E

Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord had vanished. By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins.|$|E

5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The <b>whole</b> <b>region</b> south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E
5|$|Within the Southern Hemisphere {{tropical}} cyclones generally form on {{a regular}} basis between the African coast and the middle of the South Pacific. Tropical and Subtropical Cyclones have also been noted occurring in the Southern Atlantic Ocean at times. For various reasons including where tropical cyclones form, there are several different ways to split the area between the American and African coasts. For instance the World Meteorological Organization define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones. These are the South-West Indian Ocean between the African Coast and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and the South Pacific between 160°E and 120°W. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the <b>whole</b> <b>region,</b> but splits it at 135°E into the South Pacific and the Southern Indian Ocean.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the issue of the {{governance}} of migratory phenomena and the desertification processes of <b>whole</b> <b>regions</b> or macroareas. In particular, it studies the effects of immigration on income inequality, attempting to demonstrate, through a critical review of the most recent research on the relationship between migration and inequality and an empirical investigation related to the effects of new internal migration in the Italian case, how out-migration can increase income inequalities, thus hindering economic growth and exacerbating regional disparities, while immigration can reduce income inequalities and mitigate economic imbalances, according to the hypothesis of skilled immigration equalising, formulated in 2008 by Kahanec and Zimmermann. From the analysis of the Italian case emerge, moreover, some useful suggestions to help policy makers and lawgivers in the management of internal migratory phenomena and counteract the human and industrial desertification of <b>whole</b> <b>regions</b> or macroareas...|$|R
