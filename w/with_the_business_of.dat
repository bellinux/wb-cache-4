5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the {{background}} not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune {{on the back of}} Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E

The involvement of the Swiss company and the transfer of the trademark to it in 2012 have been seen by Corporate Watch as part of a scheme by the firm designed to avoid tax. According to Accountancy Age, in 2012, a net amount of £35 million was paid to WDFC SA, the profit on which will only be taxed in Switzerland.

25|$|In 1841, he {{was made}} surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary, but this {{appointment}} did not give him any experience in the graver operations of surgery. He was appointed lecturer on general anatomy (microscopic anatomy) and physiology at the hospital in 1843, and warden of the hospital college then founded. For the next eight years, he lived {{within the walls of}} the hospital, in charge of about 30 students resident in the little college. Besides his lectures and his superintendence of the resident students, he had to enter all new students, to advise them how to work, and to manage the finances and the general affairs of the school. Thus, he was constantly occupied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> the school, and often passed a week, or more, without going outside the hospital gates.|$|E
25|$|A crucial {{reason why}} {{governmental}} powers are separated among three {{branches of government}} – the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary – is so that the exercise of power by one branch may be checked by the other two branches. In addition to approving the Government's expenditure of public funds, Parliament exercises a check over the Cabinet through the power of MPs to question the Prime Minister and other Ministers regarding the Government's policies and decisions. MPs may put questions to Ministers relating to affairs within their official functions, or bills, motions or other public matters connected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> Parliament for which they are responsible. Questions may also be put to other MPs relating to matters that they are responsible for. However, this is a weak check when most of the MPs are members of the political party in power, as they are constrained by party discipline to adhere to the policies it espouses.|$|E

500|$|Hosseini {{disclosed}} {{that in some}} ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly because when he penned The Kite Runner, [...] "no one was waiting for it." [...] He also found his second novel to be more [...] "ambitious" [...] than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, [...] "As I began to write, as the story picked up pace and I found myself immersed {{in the world of}} Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and enabled me to tune out the background noise and get on <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> inhabiting the world I was creating."

500|$|Henry {{controlled}} more of France {{than any}} ruler since the Carolingians; these lands, combined with his possessions in England, Wales, Scotland {{and much of}} Ireland, produced a vast domain often referred to by historians as the Angevin empire. The empire lacked a coherent structure or central control; instead, it consisted of a loose, flexible network of family connections and lands. Different local customs applied within each of Henry's different territories, although common principles underpinned some of these local variations. Henry travelled constantly across the empire, producing what the historian John Jolliffe describes as a [...] "government of the roads and roadsides". His travels coincided with regional governmental reforms and other local administrative business, although messengers connected him to his possession wherever he went. In his absence the lands were ruled by seneschals and justiciars, and beneath them local officials {{in each of the}} regions carried on <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> government. Nonetheless, many of the functions of government centred on Henry himself and he was often surrounded by petitioners requesting decisions or favours.|$|E

500|$|Promoted to air marshal, Newham became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) on 21 May 1985, {{succeeding}} Air Marshal David Evans. [...] Newham initially {{endorsed the}} Federal government's 1986 Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, {{otherwise known as}} the Dibb Report, but shortly afterwards publicly criticised its [...] "understanding of the application of air power" [...] and [...] "debatable judgments", especially its lukewarm attitude to the employment of the F-111s for strategic strike. At a conference the same year, he reiterated the RAAF's position that [...] "defensive action may prevent defeat, but wars can be won only by offensive action". On 9 June, he was raised to Companion of the Order of Australia for service to the RAAF, [...] "particularly as Chief of the Air Staff". Newham's term as CAS was also marked by the Federal government's decision to transfer the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army, against the recommendation of an independent committee. According to Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, [...] "Newham protected {{the best interests of}} the Australian Defence Force by getting on <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> effecting the transfer, notwithstanding the deep disappointment within his own service. In February 1987, OPCOM (subsequently Air Command) was restructured into Force Element Groups (FEGs), large functional organisations that supplanted the earlier concept of all-powerful air base commands, to which every unit on a base reported. Initially established on a one-year trial basis, the FEGs have remained in place.|$|E
500|$|On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah's behalf to {{recommend}} to the British king, George VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan's first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who {{had hoped to}} have that position in both dominions—he would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten {{would be likely to}} favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, as well as sectarian violence. [...] Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten's plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, [...] "That's the end of that." [...] On 11 August, he presided over the new constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, [...] "You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> the State ... I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State." [...] On 14 August, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, [...] "here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam." ...|$|E
