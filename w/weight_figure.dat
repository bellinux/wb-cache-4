40|$|Subjects rated 12 {{female body}} shapes {{with respect to}} their {{physical}} attractiveness, {{and the extent to which}} they would be expected to possess various personality characteristics. The shapes were varied using 3 levels of overall weight and 4 levels of body shapeliness. The sample was modified to control for socioeconomic factors and results are based on 297 undergraduates from Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic racial backgrounds. Loglinear analyses revealed that men and women, regardless of racial background, rated shapely underweight females as most physically attractive, sexy, and ideal for a woman, followed by normal <b>weight</b> <b>figures</b> of similar proportion. African Americans, women in particular, judged the shapely normal <b>weight</b> <b>figures</b> more favorably than the other subjects. Multidimensional scaling and subsequent frequency analyses showed that those figures judged as most attractive, sexy, and ideal were also expected to be fairly emotionally stable, and most successful and interpersonally competitive, but least faithful, kind, and family-oriented. Overweight female shapes, while rated as least physically attractive, sexy, and emotionally stable, were expected to be most family-oriented, kind, and faithful. Shapely normal <b>weight</b> <b>figures</b> were judged to be attractive and sexy, and were assumed to possess a moderate amount of the personality traits in question. The results suggest that Caucasian and Hispanic subjects prefer shapely underweight women, while African Americans, particularly women, find shapely underweight and shapely normal weight women to be physically appealing. African American women also rate shapely normal weight women favorably with respect to personality traits. This perceptual difference may help inoculate them from developing eating disturbances and account for the low prevalence rate of eating disorders in African Americans compared to women of other racial backgrounds. It is suggested that future research identify those beliefs, values or behaviors that seem to inoculate African American women from developing eating disorders. Once identified, mental health professionals may facilitate their development in those women who are likely to have eating problems...|$|R

40|$|Background: Since the {{commencement}} of the European colonisation of Australia in 1788, the lives and worlds of Australian Aboriginal peoples have changed dramatically. Following separation from land, family, culture, and a rapid change in diet and lifestyle, Aboriginal peoples now encounter a range of health concerns, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, poorer mental health, and lower life expectancy, {{that did not exist}} prior to colonisation. Body image has previously been a White, middle class, female concern, with other populations such as Black and Indigenous populations, considered immune. In contemporary Western society, the sociocultural messages surrounding body ideals, particularly the thin female ideal are considered to be so pervasive that they are thought to have infiltrated minority cultures. Methodology: The present study examined the perceptions of body weight, shape, obesity, body image, body satisfaction and body ideals of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women (N= 625) from rural and urban locations within NSW. The participants completed the quantitative “Body Image for Women” questionnaire that was designed specifically for this study in consultation with the University of Sydney Koori Centre using validated scales. The participants’ ages ranged from 11 - 90 years. Results: Results indicated similarities with other studies of Australian women. The Aboriginal women in the present study had poorer body image, greater body dissatisfaction, were {{more likely to engage in}} strategies to modify weight and increase muscles, compared to the non-Aboriginal women. The Aboriginal women also had an acceptance of larger body ideals, and were more likely to be underweight, or obese. BMI was shown to be the largest predictor of desired body <b>weight,</b> <b>figure</b> rating scale selections, and body appearance ratings in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women. The majority of women in the normal weight category desired weight loss, although the Aboriginal women in the normal weight category were more likely than their non-Aboriginal counterparts to desire weight gain. Discussion: A close inspection of the results reveals that any differences in the perceptions and attitudes of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women may not reflect differences borne of cultural background, but rather a difference in body weight, which in turn impacts on perceptions. Despite the fact that the present study may not indicate higher body esteem or more positive body image among Aboriginal women as has been previously suggested, the greater propensity toward obesity among Aboriginal women is worthy of concern. Considering the health implications of obesity and a greater acceptance of larger body sizes, the present findings suggest the need for urgent further investigation so these concerns can be addressed through the design and implementation of culturally appropriate and relevant health education and disease prevention programs...|$|E

40|$|Characterization of Cu in Methanol Steam Reforming Catalysts by CO Adsorption and IR Spectroscopy J. Kröhnert, F. C. Jentoft, A. Szizybalski, T. Ressler, R. Schlögl Dept. Inorg. Chem., Fritz-Haber-Institut, MPG, Faradayweg 4 - 6, 14195 Berlin Introduction Supported Cu {{systems are}} {{suitable}} catalysts for methanol synthesis and methanol steam reforming. Cu/ZrO 2 {{is emerging as}} a highly selective material for the steam reforming reaction [1, 2]. Little {{is known about the}} surface state of Cu on zirconia and the interaction of Cu with this support, particularly in comparison to conventional Cu/ZnO systems. Goal of this work was to identify the nature of Cu surface sites on Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts, and to compare to the Cu/ZnO system. Different preparative methods ensure a variety of zirconia morphologies and a range of Cu particle sizes and microstructures. The conditions at start-up and intermittent oxidizing treatments are known to affect the catalytic performance. Hence, the samples were subjected to oxidizing or reducing treatments prior to analysis. To probe the sites, CO was adsorbed at 298 K and the carbonyl species were analyzed by IR spectroscopy. Experimental Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts were prepared in three different ways: Cu/ZrO 2 nanopowders by precipitation of Cu(NO 3) 2, mesoporous CuO/ZrO 2 by using copper acetate and a block copolymer as templating agent, and macroporous CuO/ZrO 2 by using a polymer gel templating technique and copper acetylacetonate. Zirconium propylate was employed as zirconia precursor. The materials were calcined at 723 – 773 K. Copper contents were 6 to 15 at % [3]. Transmission IR spectra, with the samples pressed into self-supporting wafers, were recorded using a PerkinElmer S 2000. After treatments, the cell was evacuated and CO was dosed. For diffuse reflectance IR spectroscopy, a Graseby Specac "Selector" attachment with environmental chamber was placed in a Bruker IFS 66. CO was diluted with He to achieve the desired partial pressure and then admitted to the cell for 15 min. Spectra were recorded after purging gas phase CO species from the cell. All treatments were performed in flow, with either 2 % or 15 % H 2, or 20 % O 2 (balance of He). Results and Discussion For some samples, {{it was not possible to}} observe adsorption of CO due to lack in transmittance. These samples were investigated in diffuse reflection. A test sample was selected for analysis in both, transmission and reflection, modes. Satisfactory agreement between the data was achieved. The spectra taken of the various samples after first activation in H 2 differed in the OH-group and carbonate vibrations. Several CO species could be distinguished (Figs. 1 & 2). A band at  2185 cm 1 was occasionally observed and is assigned to CO adsorption on coordinatively unsaturated Zr 4 + ions. The species belonging to a band at  2112 cm- 1 were fairly stable after removal of CO from the gas phase and thus according to the literature classify as CO attached to Cu+. A distinct band at  2094 cm- 1 was detected, and after the initial reduction this band always showed an extended shoulder towards lower wavenumbers. The Cu/ZnO sample exhibited a conspicuously narrow band at 2097 cm- 1 and a pronounced band at 2065 cm- 1. The species generating bands below  2100 cm- 1 are weakly adsorbed and most likely arise from adsorption on reduced Cu in different environments. After oxidation these species disappear (Fig. 1). Bulk methods indicate CuO after oxidation, but Cu 2 + cannot be probed by CO at 298 K. Figure 1 : Adsorption of 95 hPa CO at RT on Cu/ZrO 2 after different treatments. Spectra normalized to wafer area <b>weight.</b> <b>Figure</b> 2 : Adsorption of 95 hPa CO at RT on Cu/ZrO 2 series with different Cu dispersions after pretreatment in H 2 at 523 K. Spectra normalized to wafer area weight. The investigations demonstrate that a number of different surface sites are available on supported Cu catalysts. The results show that a tuning of the electronic nature of the Cu species can be achieved through variation of the support, preparation procedure, post-calcination treatments (Fig. 1), or copper content (Fig. 2).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to report on a study that {{examined}} the effect of working memory training (using the n-back task) on fluid intelligence (Gf). Recent research by Jaeggi and colleagues (2008; 2010) found that training in a visualspatial n-back task resulted in gains on two different matrix reasoning tests of fluid intelligence (compared to participants who did no task). The present study replicated and extended these results by testing the fluid intelligence construct using {{a different type of}} fluid intelligence test, and employing an ‘active’ rather than ‘no-contact’ control group to account for motivational effects on intelligence test performance. Fifty eight participants were involved and their fluid intelligence was assessed pre-training using the <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (experimental or active control), and both groups did a training task on their home computer for 20 days, for 20 minutes a day.

After training, participants were retested using the <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> subtest. Participants’ <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> scores were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results of this analysis revealed {{no significant difference between the}} training groups in terms of performance on the <b>Figure</b> <b>Weights</b> subtest, suggesting that the n-back task was not effective in increasing fluid reasoning ability. These findings were in contrast to those of Jaeggi et al. (2008) and Jaeggi et al.
