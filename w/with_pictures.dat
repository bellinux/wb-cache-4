5|$|In September, President Arthur carried Irish {{republicans}} Muriel MacSwiney, {{widow of}} the recently deceased Lord Mayor of Cork Terence MacSwiney, and Linda Mary Kearns, who had been jailed for murder under the Black and Tans, to New York.

5|$|Not in Front of the Children {{explores the}} {{development}} of U.S. case law with different standards of censorship for children and adults. The author describes a 1968 Supreme Court of the United States case, Ginsberg v. New York, where the court upheld a law preventing minors from viewing sexually explicit media. Sam Ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in Bellmore, New York. A mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner, creating a situation where Ginsberg would be prosecuted. Ginsberg was convicted of violating a New York State law which forbade selling magazines <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> of nude women to minors.|$|E

He {{proceeds}} to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E

5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} commemorating Corkhill's {{efforts in}} the war was erected in Tilba, and she was presented with the medal by Governor-General Lord Foster. Following the war, Corkhill went on to pursue a nursing career. After serving as a nurse in various hospitals both in Australia and overseas, Corkhill became the senior sister at the District Hospital in Bega, New South Wales in 1951. In 1975, she donated a large collection of her father's photographs to the National Library of Australia. Amongst the one thousand piece collection were personal photographs along <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> of the Tilba area, which were later {{used to create a}} book, Taken at Tilba, and an engagement calendar. Corkhill was a skilled horsewoman, and was the lead in the centenary Cooma Show. A supper cloth made by Corkhill while on duty has been used as an example of decorative crafts of the era, and a number of photographs she had taken while on duty were donated to the Australian War Memorial. Corkhill died on 4 December 1985 in Dalmeny, New South Wales. She was unmarried.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Abdullah leaves Afghanistan and Mr. Wahdati suffers a stroke, {{prompting}} Nila to take Pari {{and move to}} Paris, France. Nabi, while assuming the role of Wahdati's primary caregiver, finds a number of sketchbooks in Wahdati's closet filled <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> of him drawn before the stroke. Unnerved by the discovery that Mr. Wahdati loves him, he resolves to leave but decides against it after {{he is unable to}} find someone suitable to take over for him. Nabi subsequently spends the next 50 years working for Mr. Wahdati. He develops a deep bond with his employer, and Nabi comes to the realization that his purpose is to take care of Mr. Wahdati. Later Mr. Wahdati's health deteriorates further, and Nabi helps him commit assisted suicide by kissing him on the lips and pressing a pillow over his face.|$|E

5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> and descriptions, many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E
5|$|On Edward's {{death in}} 1648, Anthony Hungerford, his half-brother, {{inherited}} the castle. The north chapel was extensively renovated {{during this period}} by Edward's widow, Margaret Hungerford, who covered the walls <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> of saints, cherubs, clouds, ribbons, crowns and heraldry, {{as part of an}} elaborate tomb for her and Edward which cost £1,100 (£136,000 in 2009 terms). The renovation effectively blocked most of the access into the north chapel, making the new tomb the focus of attention for any visitor or religious activity. A number of lead, anthropomorphic coffins, some with moulded faces or death masks, were laid down in the crypt in the mid- to late-17th century. Four men, two women and two children were embalmed in the castle in this way, probably including Edward and Margaret, as well as the final Sir Edward Hungerford, his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Such lead coffins were extremely expensive during the period and reserved for the wealthiest in society. Originally the lead coffins would have been encased in wood, but this outer casing has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> {{on the left and}} dialog and {{descriptions}} on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E

5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back <b>with</b> <b>pictures</b> of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
