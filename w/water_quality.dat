5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E

The study was conducted by dividing of each estuary into 10 stations. Community structure and physical chemical waters parameters was analyzed descriptively. The relationship of physical and chemical <b>waters</b> <b>quality</b> parameters with macrozoobenthos diversity indices was analyzed by regression. The results showed that 8 species found in the estuary of Berenyok, 11 species in the estuary of Ancar and 12 species in the estuary of Jangkok.

30|$|Knowledge of {{infiltration}} {{process is}} essential for agriculture, hydrologic study, watershed management, irrigation system design and drainage design. In this investigation, three soft computing techniques (SVR, GP and M 5 P tree) and two empirical models (MLR and Kostiakov model) were used to estimate the infiltration rate of the soil with different <b>water</b> <b>qualities.</b> The obtained results concluded that the M 5 P tree model is the most efficient model to predict the infiltration rate of the soil with different <b>water</b> <b>qualities</b> than the SVR, GP, MLR and Kostiakov model, whereas the results of SVM were more suitable {{as compared to the}} GP and MLR and also gave better prediction than Kostiakov model. Thus, M 5 P tree model was the most suitable model for predicting the infiltration rate of the soil. Finally, SA suggests that cumulative time is an essential parameter which affects the infiltration rate of the soil with different <b>water</b> <b>qualities</b> using M 5 P model tree for this data set.|$|R
