[...] "Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play for their kids and say, 'This is what I was listening to <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> age. Check it out, it’s still fucking cool.' We {{wanted to make a}} record you could pass down. There’s a lot of music out now that doesn’t feel like that." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Bump {{turned down an}} offer to play {{professional}} football for the Detroit Lions, saying {{he said he had}} obtained a job in Chicago outside of football. [...] Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching. [...] He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach. [...] In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under Kip Taylor at Oregon State, where he remained for three seasons, from 1949–1951. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I was only 24 when Kip Taylor hired me as backfield coach at Oregon State, and it bothered me a little because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was." [...] It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends. [...] Bump recalled: [...] "After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a cigaret. [...] One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't smoke, coach; I didn't do it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> age." [...] Oregon State had an overall record of 14–15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} the album, Mars said: [...] "I'm never singing another ballad again," [...] but {{that came from the}} gut – it's the most honest, real thing I've ever sung," [...] he says. [...] "When there are no safe bets, that's when I feel my blood move." [...] He also shared how {{important}} the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukeboxs artwork via his Twitter account. [...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Your</b> Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

"Not {{what you}} meant, perhaps; {{but what it}} did {{convince}} me was, that you--as you are, my Ermine--are ten thousand times {{more to me than}} even as the beautiful girl, and that there never can be a happier pair than we shall <b>be</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>your</b> hands and feet." ...|$|R
500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to do right by his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> age I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
