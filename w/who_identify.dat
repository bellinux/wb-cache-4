5|$|Women <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as lesbian report feeling {{significantly}} different and isolated during adolescence. These emotions {{have been cited}} as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as bisexual. On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.|$|E
5|$|A small {{minority}} of the population practise ancient Pagan religions. Neopaganism in the United Kingdom is primarily represented by Wicca and Witchcraft religions, Druidry, and Heathenry. According to the 2011 UK Census, there are roughly 53,172 people <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as Pagan in England, and 3,448 in Wales, including 11,026 Wiccans in England and 740 in Wales.|$|E
5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center found that women <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as lesbian or bisexual {{are less likely to}} abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E

5000|$|In the 2001 census, {{the amount}} of people <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as [...] "White (British)" [...] was 297, of the 303 {{people who lived in}} the village. This works out to be 98% of the {{population}} that identifies as a white British person. The rest of the town, which was only 6 people, identified as [...] "white (Other)" [...] This changed in the 2011 census, where, of the 263 people who lived in the village at the time, 253 identified as white British, which is a decrease down to 96% of the population of Parham. There were 10 people <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as something other than white British, these were 1 person <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as Irish, 5 people <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as other white, 1 <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as [...] "mixed/multiple ethnic groups, White and Black Caribbean, and 3 <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as mixed/multiple ethnic groups; White and Asian. this shows that the village is becoming more diverse.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, they {{examined}} how those <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> solely as Māori versus those <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> partially differed {{in terms of}} a range of psychological and economic outcomes. They found that those <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as having mixed Māori and European ancestry reported significantly higher satisfaction with their standard of living, personal health, future security, and the economic situation in New Zealand. Identifying with a mixed ancestry was also associated with having political views closer to those of white New Zealanders, such as supporting the New Zealand National Party. Those <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> solely as Māori showed increased support for the Māori Party, and were more supportive of bicultural policies.|$|R
5|$|Other critics, {{especially}} women <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as feminists but sharply differ with Dworkin's style or positions, have offered nuanced views, suggesting that Dworkin {{called attention to}} real and important problems, but that her legacy as a whole had been destructive to the women's movement. Her work and activism on pornography—especially {{in the form of}} the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance—drew heavy criticism from groups such as the Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force (FACT) and even some fellow anti-pornography feminists, who criticized the Dworkin–MacKinnon legal approach as undermining civil rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{religion of}} the Māori population was animistic, but {{with the arrival of}} missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Māori population converted to Christianity. In the 2013 census, 2,595 Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs. The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rātana church has adherents among Māori. Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E
5|$|The initialism, LGBT, is {{intended}} to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It {{may be used to}} refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ or LGBTQI. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum of gender and sexuality.|$|E

5|$|In Gampaha District, Tamils have {{historically}} inhabited the coastal region. In the Puttalam District, {{there was a}} substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century. Most of those <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as Udappu and Maradankulam. There are also Tamil Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics, who have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam, and also in villages such as Mampuri. Some residents of these two districts, especially the traditional fishermen, are bilingual, ensuring that the Tamil language survives as a lingua franca among migrating fishing communities across the island. Negombo Tamil dialect is spoken by about 50,000 people. This number does not include others, outside of Negombo city, who speak local varieties of the Tamil language.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated how an individual’s self-reported smoking status {{between the}} ages of 15 and 25 relates to an individual’s current attitude on recreational drug use. Participants responded to an online survey asking about their opinions of the wrongness of drug use in six categories. The group of participants <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as a smoker {{between the ages}} of 15 and 25 has a significantly higher score than the group of participants <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as a non-smoker during the same ages. The mean score for those <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as a smoker (n= 65) was 14. 27. The mean score for those <b>who</b> <b>identified</b> as a non-smoker (n= 67) was 10. 57. There was {{a significant difference between the}} smokers and non-smokers, t(130) = 3. 46, p 3 ̆c. 05. This difference indicates smokers have a more accepting attitude regarding drug use than non-smokers...|$|R
5|$|Skeptics <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> {{issues with}} the traditionalist view point to {{possible}} anachronisms in The Art of War including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows and the unmentioned cavalry), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that {{should not have been}} available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when The Art of War was actually written. The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active {{in the last years of}} the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places The Art of War during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at Yin-ch’ueh-shan in 1972 AD.|$|E

However, people endorsing fundamentalist religious beliefs are more likely to be low on Openness. Similarly, people <b>who</b> <b>identify</b> as spiritual are more likely to be high on Extroversion and Openness, although this varied based on the type of spirituality endorsed.|$|E
