Recent advances in GDAL/OGR and QGIS will allow easier handling of appschema data. A consortium of titellus, Spatialys, Camptocamp, Oslandia and BRGM has taken this task in the scope of the European Union's Earth observation programme Copernicus, as part of the tasks delegated to the European Environment Agency. The functionality will become available from the upcoming 3. 0 version of QGIS. In this workshop we will guide you through the world of application schema in GDAL/OGR and QGIS. Since its introduction the GML Application Schema (GMLAS) driver has received quite some positive feedback, being for example able to address national schemas used in Finland or Japan, beyond the initial use cases it was developed for (Inspire, GeoSciML, GroundWaterML) We will start the workshop with a section on dataset discovery from within QGIS, by querying a spatial catalogue. We will from there connect to a WFS endpoint to retrieve appschema features. We’ll explain how GMLAS is able to automatically set up a relational datamodel in PostGIS by analysing the application schema and load the GML into the database. QGIS will then be able to visualise the data in a map view. <b>You</b> are <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> modify the data and finally export the data from QGIS as application schema GML. <b>We</b> also <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> bring some of your personal data to load as and/or transform to an application schema of your choice.
