Many docks are {{not designed}} to <b>withstand</b> the weight of several resting sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better <b>withstand</b> them.|$|E

5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The sutures between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able to <b>withstand</b> a high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to <b>withstand</b> tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E

30|$|The key product {{characteristic}} of {{concern is the}} <b>withstanding</b> pressure of the pipe. The process control parameters influencing the <b>withstanding</b> pressure of the pipes are: the feeding zone temperature, melting zone temperature, pushing zone temperature, dimmer speed and die head temperature. These are the factors which mainly govern the <b>withstanding</b> pressure to improve the pipe quality. Among the enlisted process control parameters, {{it is necessary to}} identify the dominant factors, reducing the variables and determining the optimal process control variable values to promote the efficiency of the extrusion manufacturing process.|$|R
5|$|At the East Gate, the {{situation}} also became serious, {{for a larger}} Byzantine force {{had been assigned to}} this sector. Rafay was unable to <b>withstand</b> their attacks. The timely arrival of Khalid with his reserve of 400 veteran cavalry and his subsequent attack on the Roman flank, marked the turning point in the sally at the Eastern Gate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to <b>withstand</b> low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to <b>withstand</b> a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} thick outer peridium, Mycenastrum corium puffballs can <b>withstand</b> hard blows without breaking, and {{children}} have used them as replacements for balls. The puffballs {{have also been}} used medicinally in Mexico as a hemostatic, as a throat and lung tonic, and for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E

Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this.

5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could <b>withstand</b> 120 pounds per square foot, a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified load could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could <b>withstand</b> the load without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum load. In 1992, over {{a decade after the}} mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim to be able to support the load without the use of a composite topping.|$|E
