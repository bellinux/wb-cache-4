500|$|The developers' {{theory is}} that the {{international}} attention gained through large developments and having the world's tallest building will incur gentrification of the country and even be a financial success in the long run. Rory Olcayto, deputy editor of The Architects’ Journal, said [...] "The race to build the highest skyscraper is quite futile – <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> stop? These buildings are a symbol of an old-fashioned way of thinking,” while architect Adrian Smith, the designer of the tower, states, [...] "...this tower symbolizes the Kingdom as an important global business and cultural leader, and demonstrates the strength and creative vision of its people. It represents new growth and high-performance technology fused into one powerful iconic form." [...] However, Bob Sinn, principal engineer at Thornton Tomasetti, stated that the practical challenges of building supertall buildings are greater than the structural challenges.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Mehldau also {{recorded}} Highway Rider, an album that combined his usual trio with guest musicians and a 28-piece orchestra. Again based compositionally {{on the theme}} of travel or a journey, the album was produced by Brion, and, in critic Mike Hobart's description, [...] "probes the confluence of the arbitrary and non-arbitrary in music, of balancing what is committed to the page with improvisation." [...] This was pursued further in the winter of 2010–11, in public performances of pieces from the album in the US and Europe. Mehldau's trio returned to the studio {{for the first time in}} several years in 2008 and again in 2011, resulting in Ode, an album of the pianist's originals, and <b>Where</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> Start, an album of covers. Down Beat reviewer Jim Macnie commented that, on the former album, [...] "More than ever, Mehldau uses his instrument as a drum, popping staccato notes into the maw of the rhythm section's formidable bustle." ...|$|E
500|$|Devil's Due {{released}} three-issue mini-series Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, {{the story}} bridges {{the gap between}} Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode {{in the aftermath of}} the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is [...] "trying to get better and trying to repair, but <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> even start after going through such horror? How do you even try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?" [...] Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the [...] "bloodline plot of the middle sequels", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that [...] "it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, [...] "it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it’s the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential." ...|$|E

500|$|A Kryptonian sent by {{his parents}} to Earth as an infant to escape the {{destruction}} of his homeworld, Krypton, and raised in Smallville, Kansas, under mental guidance of farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent until he is inspired by the holographic message from his late father to become Earth's greatest protector (Superman is depicted as being 33 years old, {{at least from the}} moment he is found, in the present timeline of the film). Cavill is the first British and non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in , which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns, but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, [...] "There's a very real story behind the Superman character." [...] He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, [...] "He's alone and there's no one like him," [...] referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. [...] "That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and {{trying to find out what}} makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> draw a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness." [...] In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent.|$|E
