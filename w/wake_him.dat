5|$|Within a dreamscape, hunter Bobby Singer (Beaver) {{searches}} {{around an}} old house and is suddenly attacked by a woman (Elizabeth Marleau). A maid tries to no avail to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> up in his motel room. Meanwhile, Dean Winchester (Ackles) finds his brother Sam (Padalecki) drinking at a bar {{in the middle of}} the afternoon. When Dean questions him about it, a drunken Sam admits that he is upset about not being able to save Dean from his demonic pact, which left him only a year to live. What bothers Sam even more is that Dean, who has little self-worth, is not even concerned about his fate. Their conversation is interrupted by a call from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the 716th Infantry Division, Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter, was informed at 01:20 of the parachute landings and that the bridges had been captured intact. One of his first actions was to contact Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division. Richter ordered the division to attack the landing areas. While Feuchtinger's tanks were delegated to support the 716th, it was {{also part of the}} German armoured reserve that could not move without orders from the German High Command. All German panzer formations could only be moved on the direct orders of Adolf Hitler, who was sleeping at the time and his staff refused to <b>wake</b> <b>him.</b> When the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment received news of the airborne landings at 01:30, Luck ordered the regiment to their assembly areas north and east of Caen and to wait for further orders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, during {{a night out}} with Dr. Whale (David Anders), Mary Margaret (Goodwin) tries {{to make a little}} {{conversation}} with him; however, he is busy ogling Ruby (Meghan Ory), prompting Mary Margaret to leave the cafe by herself. As she walks back to her apartment, she notices Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) in her car reading a newspaper and searching for a place to stay. Mary Margaret offers Emma a spare room at her apartment. The following day, Mary Margaret notices Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) looking at the comatose John Doe (Dallas) while they are setting up decorations at the hospital. Henry believes that John Doe is Prince Charming and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Henry asks her to read to Charming from the storybook, convinced that it will <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> up. Emma persuades Mary Margaret to go along with Henry's wishes so that they can prove the stories aren't real. At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the stories to the patient, until his hand grabs hers, shocking Mary Margaret. She tells Dr. Whale that Charming might be waking up, but the doctor does not believe her. After she leaves, Dr. Whale calls Regina (Parrilla), as he had been instructed to do should there be a change in John Doe's state, revealing that he had been lying to Mary Margaret.|$|E
60|$|And yet he slept. Riding on {{among those}} {{sentinels}} of God, he slept, {{and did not}} change the purpose of his journey. If he forgot it in his troubled dreams, it came up steadily, and <b>woke</b> <b>him.</b> But it never <b>woke</b> <b>him</b> to remorse, or to abandonment of his design.|$|R
60|$|What <b>woke</b> <b>him</b> {{from his}} dream? The cry of his {{starving}} people.|$|R

25|$|Reyat later {{visited a}} {{television}} repair shop with a partially disassembled car clock wired to a lantern battery. He needed help {{so that the}} buzzer stayed on rather than intermittently beeping, {{so that it would}} turn on a light in his camper to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> up. The repairman knew his friend did not own a camper, and it would even strike Justice J. Raymond Paris at Reyat's 1991 trial as an odd use for a timer.|$|E
25|$|Soon after 21:00 on December 14, 1989, Sakharov went to {{his study}} {{to take a nap}} before {{preparing}} an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress. His wife went to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> at 23:00 as he had requested but she found Sakharov dead on the floor. According to the notes of Yakov Rapoport, a senior pathologist present at the autopsy, it is most likely that Sakharov died of an arrhythmia consequent to dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 68. He was interred in the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|On the {{following}} day at 7:15a.m., Borel arrived {{at the home of}} his friend Alan Guillemette. When Guillemette's mother opened the door Eric asked her to <b>wake</b> <b>him.</b> The two had a lengthy discussion in the garden, and apparently Eric wanted something from Guillemette, but when he declined and turned {{to go back into the}} house, Eric shot him in the back, mortally wounding him. From 7:30a.m. onwards, Borel started shooting people at random. No one grew suspicious of his rifle until he started his rampage, since it was hunting season and the sight of rifles outside was to be expected.|$|E

25|$|Eugene {{returned}} to Vienna from the War of the Polish Succession in October 1735, weak and feeble; when Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen married in February 1736 Eugene was {{too ill to}} attend. After playing cards at Countess Batthyány's {{on the evening of}} 20 April he {{returned to}} his bed at the Stadtpalais. When his servants arrived to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> the next morning, 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after choking from phlegm in his throat, presumably after suffering from pneumonia. Eugene's heart was buried with those of others of his family in Turin. His remains were carried in a long procession to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where the body was interred in the Kreuzkapelle.|$|E
25|$|For Ben-Hur, Simonides bribes Sejanus {{to remove}} the prefect Valerius Gratus from his post; Valerius is succeeded by Pontius Pilate. Ben-Hur sets out for Jerusalem to find his mother and sister. Pilate's review of the prison records reveals great injustice, and he notes Gratus {{concealed}} a walled-up cell. Pilate's troops reopen the cell to find two women, Judah's long-lost mother and sister, suffering from leprosy. Pilate releases them, and {{they go to the}} old Hur house, which is vacant. Finding Judah asleep on the steps, they give thanks to God that he is alive, but do not <b>wake</b> <b>him.</b> As lepers, they are considered less than human. Banished from the city, they leave in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Arindal is hallucinating {{that he is}} hunting a doe. As it is killed, he realises it is his wife. He {{continues}} to experience visions (Ich seh' den Himmel) before falling asleep. The voice of the petrified but weeping Ada is heard calling for him. Then the voice of Groma calls to him too. A sword, shield and lyre appear which Groma says can win Arindal victory and a greater reward. Zemina and Farzana, enter. The former expresses her pity for Arindal while the latter says he deserves punishment for seeking to take Ada from them. They <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> and announce they will lead him to Ada to rescue her. He expresses his willingness to die for her. The two fairies hope this will actually happen.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} act Ariel briefly appears to stop a {{conspiracy}} to kill Alonso, King of Naples, whose brother (and heir to the dukedom), Sebastian, plots to kill him in his sleep. Ariel sings in the ear of Gonzalo, a councillor to Alonso, to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> and foils the plot. Ariel also appears in Act Three to foil Caliban's plot to turn the sailors against Prospero and murder him. Later in the same act, he appears with a clap of thunder and rebukes those {{who were involved in}} the plot to banish Prospero to the island, displaying his fearful power to the men. He is later called on to gather the spirits of the island before Miranda and Ferdinand, and to bring Trinculo, Stephano, and Caliban before Prospero for judgement.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in her yard. After thinking to herself {{he looks like a}} Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E
25|$|Daniel helps Paul {{to reunite}} with his estranged {{daughter}} Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). He also kisses Imogen, but she rejects him, fearing {{that he might}} be on the rebound. Daniel becomes jealous when she starts dating Caspar Smythe (Barton Welch) and his feelings for her clear. Imogen and Daniel begin a relationship and he supports her when her parents separate. Daniel moves in with the Brennan brothers at Number 24. He runs a suspended coffee scheme at Off Air, which leads to him being attacked by a homeless man who misinterprets Daniel's attempt to <b>wake</b> <b>him.</b> Daniel refuses to report the man, but he is clearly affected by the incident and displays unusual behaviour. He later takes his anger out on Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson). Off Air is closed when Daniel struggles {{to keep up with the}} payments, and Paul refuses to give him a loan. Daniel finds Aaron and Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt) searching through Paul's personal computer files, and they find Paul's plans for a housing estate surrounding Erinsborough High. Daniel sends all the files to the media.|$|E

25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to <b>wake</b> <b>him,</b> and that she would see him at home.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to <b>wake</b> <b>him.</b> They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become a better man.|$|E
