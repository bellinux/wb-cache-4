5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he became}} {{involved}} in a controversy known as the Business Plot, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> a congressional committee {{that a group of}} wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations. A final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.|$|E
5|$|The French Directory did as well. In mid April, {{suffering}} from an nephritic complaint, Jourdan handed over command to {{his chief of}} staff, general of division Jean Augustin Ernouf, and returned to Paris {{to complain about the}} lack of men, the inexperience of the men he had, their supplies, and the size, experience, and supply of the army he had to face. He found little sympathy there, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the Directory that he was ill, tendering his resignation, it was accepted.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused {{to talk about it}} until towards the end of his life, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> {{attends a}} college, he rooms with a lazy, often-masturbating, homosexual, draft-dodging, fellow student, who {{inadvertently}} adds to Kepesh's insecurity. At first, {{he seems to}} accept the odd facts about his colleague, but then <b>he's</b> shocked <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> by others that he deviated from so many social norms.|$|R

5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Smith the Cardinals {{would win the}} pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{went into}} the 1965 {{election}} confident that he would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings. The LCL lost power {{for the first time}} in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–74 season saw {{the arrival}} of a new player in Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an {{established}} player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season {{for the first time since}} 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu along the way. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.|$|E

50|$|No {{longer an}} enlisted soldier, Pullo becomes enraged <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> cannot march with the XIII Legion in the celebrations. He {{heads to the}} only home he has, the darkened {{drinking}} taverns, where a drunken Quintus, son of Pompey, is denouncing Caesar to anyone who will listen. When Quintus staggers his way to Brutus' villa to berate him for taking Caesar's mercy, he instead finds a kindred spirit in Servilia.|$|R
5|$|Later {{she goes}} on a night out to The Loft nightclub and threatens Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki). She says that she will kill Lau if she ever goes near Jake again, making viewers realise that Loretta had changed her {{personality}} and her behaviour since her absence. Loretta pretends she had Leukaemia but Jake finds out the truth and ends their relationship. She later convinces Steph that Jake lied <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Steph that Loretta had said she was ill and she makes Frankie and Steph believe Jake is losing his mind again. She send messages from Jake's mobile phone and plants defaced pictures of her and Jake in his coat {{to make it look}} real. Loretta reveals to Steph that she was sexually abused as a child. Jake gets back together with Loretta to stop her from getting him put back into a mental health clinic. Nancy finds out the truth about Loretta from Adam, she confronts Loretta who pushes her over and Nancy is badly hurt. Jake saves Nancy and she agrees not to go to the police. Loretta reveals she did not lie when she was sexually abused and Jake asks her to get help and will stand by her. Loretta is last seen admitting herself into the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Libby {{does not}} dispute that he {{initially}} heard about Mrs. Wilson from Cheney, but {{he claims that}} he had no recollection of that fact <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the FBI in October 2003 and the grand jury in March 2004 that he remembered first learning about Mrs. Wilson in a conversation with NBC’s Tim Russert on July 10, 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Skjöldunga saga {{was used}} by Snorri Sturluson as a source <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the story of Aðils (Eadgils) and Yrsa, in his Ynglinga saga, {{a part of the}} Heimskringla. What remains of the Skjöldunga saga is a Latin summary by Arngrímur Jónsson, and so the two {{versions}} are basically the same, the main difference being that Arngrímur's version is more terse.|$|E
25|$|David's case came to {{international}} attention in 1997 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> {{his story to}} Milton Diamond, an academic sexologist who persuaded Reimer {{to allow him to}} report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly. Soon after, Reimer went public with his story, and John Colapinto published a widely disseminated and influential account in Rolling Stone magazine in December 1997.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{eventually}} {{turned into}} a villain once more by betraying the fans.

Fernando Molinar, a Mexican immigrant, {{has not been seen}} or heard from since September 8, 2001, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his mother on the telephone that he was starting a new job at a pizzeria near the building. A similar petition to Surrogate's Court on his behalf also was rejected.|$|E
25|$|One player {{told his}} {{teammates}} {{that there were}} certain things contained in the contracts that needed clarification. He was summoned back into Bvute's office and warned {{that it was a}} take-it-or-leave-it offer: this player was later revealed to be Anthony Ireland. Another said that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Bvute he wanted to consult with friends, Bvute {{picked up the phone and}} called Kenyon Ziehl, the head of selection, and told him he wanted the player replaced in the squad. Unsurprisingly, the player backed down and signed.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{speaks to}} Jean and tells {{her that the}} {{conversation}} Nurse Harrison claimed to have overheard seemed psychologically unlikely as two possible conspirators would never had had such a conversation {{in a place where}} they could be easily listened to. He observed the nurse's positive reaction <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her of a possible exhumation and then had her followed by Georges who witnessed the buying of the compact and the laying of the trap for Jean. The motive was jealousy as Nurse Harrison was convinced by Oldfield's kind manner over several years that he intended her to be his bride.|$|E
