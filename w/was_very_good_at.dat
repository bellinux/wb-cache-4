The comeback <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> first few balls in the second T20I, where easy catch of Martin Guptill was dropped by Thisara Perera on Udana's bowling. Since then, Udana was brutally hit by New Zealanders and Udana gave 34 runs in his 3 overs, where New Zealand won the match by 9 wickets only in the 10th over.|$|E

In his spare time, he would lecture and teach at a county agricultural school to help other farmers learn advanced farming techniques and methods to get the greatest income from their crop sales, primarily through marketing timing and group negotiations. Mount became instrumental in the formation of several farming co-ops and became well known in the region.|$|E

Nevertheless, throughout her life Addams did have significant romantic relationships {{with a few of}} these women, including Mary Rozet Smith and Ellen Starr. Her relationships offered her the time and energy to pursue her social work while being supported emotionally and romantically. From her exclusively romantic relationships with women, she would most likely be described as a lesbian in contemporary terms, similar to many leading figures in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom of the time.|$|E
25|$|Daw Amar nudges up to Ba Zaw’s {{connection}} to both Saya Chone and Ba Ohn. She states that Ba Zaw <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> painting Traditional Burmese arabesque, {{one of the}} skills which Min Naing claims he learned from Saya Chone. She also mentions that Ba Ohn was the first Burmese painter to illustrate school textbooks, and that when Ba Ohn’s illustrations became outdated, Ba Zaw was hired by Macmillan to illustrate “Burmese Peacock” readers, but she stoutly emphasizes that Ba Zaw accomplished these illustrations on his own, without instruction. She goes on to say, however, that Ba Ohn learned painting techniques from B.H. Wiles (a European painter in Burma who also taught Maung Maung Gyi) and adds that Ba Zaw was also friendly with Wiles. One must wonder if these three painters sometimes kept company, and if Ba Zaw not only learned something from Ba Ohn but also Wiles.|$|E

500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you rarely see anymore [...] {{he was a man}} with a purpose; he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> one thing and made no apologies for it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E
500|$|In March 2000, John Morgan {{took over}} as CEO from Jeff Dahlberg. By a year after joining the company as CEO, Morgan rescued Winmark from the precipice of {{bankruptcy}} by introducing stringent review of franchisee finances, shuttering failing Play It Again Sports stores, and appointing his own people to executive and board positions. Morgan chose Steve Briggs, who had been at Valspar, as the company's president. He selected as board members Kirk MacKenzie, whom he had worked with at Winthrop Resources, and Paul Reyelts, {{the chief financial officer}} at Valspar. In June 2000, Winmark sold its corporate headquarters building to Koch Trucking. The company had lost $350,700 in 2000; in 2001, it had a net income of $3.2 million. Morgan said in a 2009 interview with the Star Tribune about the state of Winmark before he joined, [...] "The company <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> selling franchises, but it was still losing money." [...] Around 2002, Winmark sold the franchises Retool, Computer Renaissance and Disc-Go-Round.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the opening}} scenes were shot in a local Los Angeles backyard, however, finding {{suitable}} [...] "tree-lined elements" [...] proved difficult. Ultimately, a museum in Hollywood allowed the crew to film in a tree-filled section on its grounds. The episode ran into several snags during filming. Director Cliff Bole had trouble {{trying to get the}} crows to [...] "act on cue". Eventually, several ravens were brought in as doubles. Bole later noted, [...] "we got two ravens. One <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> cawing and one was good at hopping." [...] The ending sequence had to be re-shot several times. Producer Paul Rabwin explained, [...] "Originally, we wanted to show a mirror image of the woman being attacked by the monster, but it didn't really sell." [...] Eventually, the crew decided to glue candy glass onto a piece of plywood. In this manner, the camera was able to see the action through the shattered panes of glass.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary". Although Kneale {{was pleased with the}} high {{production}} values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills [...] "didn't have the authority for Quatermass". He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that". Executive producer Verity Lambert's opinion is that it [...] "didn't have the staying power of the originals, but then that's almost inevitable when you try to bring something back in a slightly different form".|$|E

2500|$|MacCorkindale played {{astronomer}} Joe Kapp in Nigel Kneale's TV serial Quatermass (1979), starring alongside John Mills. He {{had previously}} starred in {{an episode of}} Kneale's series Beasts and enjoyed appearing {{in the role of}} Kapp, finding it a change from the typecast romantic roles that he had become accustomed to playing, while noting that it was [...] "challenging" [...] conveying the character's strong Jewish faith. Kneale later expressed disappointment with MacCorkindale's performance, commenting, [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> that".|$|E

Spielberg embraced the idea. [...] "About 90% of the shots on the boat were handheld," [...] Butler says. [...] "Michael was intrigued by the idea and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it.

Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm.

2500|$|Seven {{unpublished}} {{drawings for}} the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, {{as well as a}} picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff. According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, [...] "he image evokes Saint-Exupéry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince." [...] Another reviewer noted that the author [...] "chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate." [...] Not a single drawing of the story's narrator–pilot survived the author's editing process; [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> excising what was not essential to his story".|$|E
2500|$|The University of Chicago {{developed}} the major sociologists at the time. It brought them together, and even {{gave them a}} hub and a network to link all the leading sociologists. In 1925, {{a third of all}} sociology graduate students attended the University of Chicago. Chicago <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> not isolating their students from other schools. They encouraged them to blend with other sociologists, and to not spend more time in the class room than studying the society around them. [...] This would teach them real life application of the classroom teachings. The first teachings at the University of Chicago were focused on the social problems that the world had been dealt. At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; especially not to the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to go into an entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individual’s relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small {{was the head of the}} sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the American Journal of Sociology. [...] Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the program’s methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend. The pair even wrote the sociology program’s textbook for a reference and get all students on the same page more effectively. Many remarkable sociologists such as George Hebert Mead, W.E. Du Bois, Robert Park, Charles S. Johnson, William Ogburn, Hebert Blumer and many others have significant ties to the University of Chicago.|$|E
