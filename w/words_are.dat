5|$|The Nahuatl {{languages}} are agglutinative, polysynthetic languages that make {{extensive use of}} compounding, incorporation and derivation. That is, they can add many different prefixes and suffixes to a root until very long <b>words</b> <b>are</b> formed, and a single word can constitute an entire sentence.|$|E
5|$|ASL signs have {{a number}} of phonemic components, {{including}} movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan <b>words</b> <b>are</b> often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.|$|E

5|$|German is the {{official}} and predominant spoken language in Germany. Standard German is a West Germanic language and {{is closely related to}} and classified alongside Low German, Dutch, Afrikaans, Frisian and English. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the North Germanic languages. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Significant minorities of <b>words</b> <b>are</b> derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch). German is written using the Latin alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of <b>words</b> <b>are</b> called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among those <b>words</b> <b>are</b> sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E

If the player chooses a word {{that does not make}} sense {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right <b>words</b> <b>are</b> chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary <b>words</b> <b>are</b> used to indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though {{not always so}} consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E
5|$|Kurt {{has been}} {{receiving}} valentines and gifts all week from a secret admirer {{that he believes}} to be Blaine (Darren Criss), who is still home recovering from eye surgery. He arrives at Sugar's party early to discover his admirer is actually former bully Karofsky (Max Adler), who declares his love for Kurt. Kurt lets him down gently, but their parting <b>words</b> <b>are</b> overheard by a classmate of Karofsky's, and Karofsky flees.|$|E
5000|$|In metaphor a <b>word</b> <b>is</b> objected {{on another}} one {{because of some}} similarity.

30|$|In this {{notation}} author(w) is {{the author}} who originally added the word w. This pointer is set at the revision when the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> added and is never changed afterward. The pointer deleter(w) gives the last user who deleted the word. It points to nil when the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> originally added (indicating that no one deleted it so far) and is updated whenever the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> deleted. The pointer restorer(w) identifies the last user who added or restored the <b>word.</b> It <b>is</b> set to the author when the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> originally added but, in contrast to author(w), the last restorer of a word can change over time when a <b>word</b> <b>is</b> restored after being deleted.|$|R
5|$|Nagavarma II, {{poet laureate}} (Katakacharya) of King Jagadhekamalla II made {{contributions}} to Kannada literature in various subjects. His works in poetry, prosody, grammar and vocabulary are standard authorities and their {{importance to the}} study of Kannada language is well acknowledged. Kavyavalokana in poetics, Karnataka-Bhashabhushana on grammar and Vastukosa a lexicon (with Kannada equivalents for Sanskrit <b>words)</b> <b>are</b> some of his comprehensive contributions. Several works on medicine were produced during this period. Notable among them were Jagaddala Somanatha's Karnataka Kalyana Karaka.|$|E
5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the <b>words</b> <b>are</b> as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between <b>words</b> <b>are</b> deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relevant}} <b>words</b> <b>are</b> of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first <b>words</b> <b>are</b> closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' <b>words</b> <b>are</b> recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted in psycholinguistics that (1) when {{the beginning of}} a <b>word</b> <b>is</b> heard, a set of words that share the same initial sound become activated in memory, (2) the <b>words</b> that <b>are</b> activated compete with each other while {{more and more of the}} <b>word</b> <b>is</b> heard, (3) at some point, due to both the auditory input and the lexical competition, one <b>word</b> <b>is</b> recognized.|$|R
