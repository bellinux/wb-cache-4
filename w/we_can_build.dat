Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war.

2500|$|The weaker {{form of the}} theorem can {{be proven}} from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows. Assume {{that we have a}} {{consistent}} and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>build</b> an algorithm that enumerates all these statements i.e. an algorithm N that, given a natural number n, computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers, such that for all the true statements {{there is at least one}} n such that N(n) is equal to that statement. Now suppose we want to decide whether the algorithm with representation a halts on input i. [...] By using Kleene's T predicate, we can express the statement [...] "a halts on input i" [...] as a statement H(a, i) in the language of arithmetic. Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N(n) = [...] H(a, i) or there is an n such that N(n) = ¬ H(a, i). [...] So if we iterate over all n until we either find H(a, i) or its negation, we will always halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since we know that there cannot be such an algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false.|$|E
