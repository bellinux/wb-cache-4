40|$|The {{regulation}} that applies the anti-trust {{provisions of the}} EC Treaty was adopted in 1962. Since then, it has been largely left unchanged. This regulation confers to the European Commission the exclusive right to exempt agreements between companies from the prohibition contained in the anti-trust rules. The regulation will soon be repealed. If member states agree, its place will be taken by a new {{regulation that}} will allow national competition authorities and national courts to exempt agreements between companies. Since this new system of competition enforcement has never before been tried in the EU, {{it is not clear}} how it will affect companies and their operations and how national authorities and courts will work together to ensure effective enforcement of competition rules. This article examines the main provisions of the proposed new regulation and considers their likely impact on the effectiveness of competition enforcement in an enlarged European Union. The significance of the proposed reform of competition policy 3 Consider the following questions: Which policy applies to all sectors of the economy? Which policy has extra-territorial application and may penalise companies based in countries far away from the European Union? In which policy can the European Commission enter and search the premises of any company anywhere in the EU and eventually impose fines on them of up to 10 % of their <b>world-wide</b> <b>turnover?</b> In which policy does the EC Treaty empower the Commission to issue decisions or directives to member states without prior approval of the Council or Parliament? In which policy must the member states ask for authorisation by the Commission before implementing national measures? In which policy does the Commission have to deal with more than 1, 300 cases per year? Which policy is enforced directly by the Commission? Which policy is enforced with an implementing regulation that dates back to the very early years of the Community and has not changed yet? The common answer to all these questions is “competition policy”. This policy, whose objectives and enforcement procedures have remained virtually unchanged since the inception of the European Community, is now being modernised and decentralised...|$|E
40|$|Actualmente en el mundo empresarial existe la {{necesidad}} prioritaria de cuidar a los clientes. Las organizaciones invierten mucho, a veces demasiado, en este propósito. Esa inversión no siempre está correctamente fundamentada y analizada, muchas veces prima más la copia a los competidores, que un cuidadoso análisis de las necesidades internas de la propia organización. La orientación de las organizaciones hacia el cliente, no es más que el buen trato y el conocimiento exhaustivo del cliente, con el fin de incrementar su rentabilidad a lo largo del tiempo. Una de las modas que proliferan es la inversión (muchas veces gasto) en tecnologías CRM (Acrónimo en inglés de Customer Relationship Management). CRM se percibe continuamente en el mundo empresarial como 'Tecnología" no como "Filosofía" empresarial. La cifra de negocio mundial por la venta de este tipo de aplicaciones (es decir "tecnología") es creciente, lo que sorprende si pensamos que, al mismo tiempo, más de la mitad de los proyectos de implantación fracasan, o si se quiere, no alcanzan el éxito deseado. El principal motivo de fracaso suele ser por la falta de concordancia o alineamiento entre la tecnología y la estrategia global corporativa. Esta alineación debe aplicarse y verse reflejada en la estructura, cultura y los procesos de la organización, así como en las políticas en cuanto a sistemas y tecnologías de la información. At the moment, in {{the business}} world, customer care {{is one of the}} most important organizational priorities. Organizations invest a lot, sometimes too much, in this purpose. That kind of investments are not always properly supported and analyzed by organizations, and often they are based on competitors' benchmark, instead of a careful analysis of the organizational internal needs. Customer orientation is just being kind with the client and trying to get as much information as possible out of the client, in order to increase its lifetime profitability. One of the trends that proliferate is the investment (most of the time, expenditure) in CRM (Customer Relationship Management) technologies. CRM is continuously perceived {{in the business}} world as "Technology" rather than "Corporate Philosophy". The <b>world-wide</b> business <b>turnover</b> of this type of applications (i. e. 'Technology") is increasing, which is surprising, given the fact that, at the same time, more than a half of the implementation projects are likely to fait, or simply do not meet the expectations. The main reason for this failure is usually the lack of concordance or alignment between technology and global corporate strategy. This alignment must be applied within the structure, culture and the organizational processes as well as in the Information systems practices...|$|R
