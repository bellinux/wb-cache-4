5|$|In 1743, Smart {{pushed his}} {{translation}} of Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day as Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum {{and paid for}} the publication himself. With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's Essay on Man, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's An Essay on Criticism (De Arte Critica) instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.|$|E
5|$|Carol Ann Duffy was {{appointed}} as Poet Laureate in May 2009, {{the first woman}} to be appointed to the post. She was asked by the BBC Radio 4 programme Today to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch. The poem was read by Duffy on Today on 30 July 2009, the day of Allingham's funeral. Allingham, who served with the Royal Naval Air Service before becoming a founder member of the Royal Air Force, died on 18 July 2009 at the age of 113; Patch, the last surviving man to have fought in the trenches in the war, died on 25 July 2009 at the age of 111. Their deaths left Claude Choules, who served in the Royal Navy during the war and who lived in Australia until his death in 2011, as the last surviving British veteran.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} Southey to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> about {{historical}} Spain, which {{would later become}} Roderick, originated in his writing a monodrama on Cava and her being raped by Rodrigo. In 1805, he {{decided to use the}} subject for his final epic.|$|E

25|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate, to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> to {{mark the}} deaths of Patch and Henry Allingham (who died one week before Patch, on 18 July 2009).

25|$|Gregarious, intelligent, educated, and world-wise, William Walton was {{considered}} {{the most popular of}} Kennedy's friends and confidants. He frequently escorted Jacqueline Kennedy to social functions and engagements when President Kennedy's duties kept him away. But since Walton had no official political role in the Kennedy administration, he remained unknown to most of the public. He was often confused with the British composer William Walton. Walton's obscurity prompted the poet Frank O'Hara to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> about that.|$|E
25|$|Ginsberg showed {{this poem}} to Kenneth Rexroth, who criticized it as too stilted and academic; Rexroth {{encouraged}} Ginsberg to free {{his voice and}} write from his heart. Ginsberg took this advice and attempted to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> with no restrictions. He was under the immense influence of William Carlos Williams and Jack Kerouac and attempted to speak with his own voice spontaneously. Ginsberg began the poem in the stepped triadic form he took from Williams but, {{in the middle of}} typing the poem, his style altered such that his own unique form (a long line based on breath organized by a fixed base) began to emerge.|$|E

25|$|Surviving the {{turbulent}} {{decades of the}} Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms era, Tang poetry was perhaps the major influence on the poetry of the Song dynasty, for example seeing such major poets as Su Shi creating new works based upon matching lines of Du Fu's. This matching style is known from the Late Tang. Pi Rixiu and Lu Guimeng, sometimes known as Pi-Lu, were well known for it: one would <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> with a certain style and rhyme scheme, then the other would reply with a different poem, but matching the style and with the same rhymes. This allows for subtleties {{which can only be}} grasped by matching the poems together.|$|E

500|$|In 1953, it was {{designated}} as a Grade I listed building. In February 2008, the poet laureate of the United Kingdom, Andrew Motion, was commissioned by the BBC West television programme Inside Out West to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> in Harry Patch's honour.

The result, Last Post, was read by Duffy on the BBC Radio 4 programme Today {{on the day of}} Allingham's funeral. [...] A tree was planted, and a commemorative plaque unveiled, at the Eastbourne Redoubt on 22 May 2010 to mark Allingham's residence in the town.|$|E
500|$|Hebel's admirers include Goethe, Gottfried Keller and Tolstoy. Goethe, {{who tried}} to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> (the [...] "Schweizerlied", Swiss song) in Alemannic himself, praised the Allemannische Gedichte highly. According to him, Hebel [...] "countrified the {{universe}} in the most naive, graceful fashion". But {{on the question of}} whether he would translate Hebel's works, Goethe said: [...] "Such a great poet should be only read in the original! One just needs to learn this language!" [...] The Brothers Grimm also admired Hebel, and he met Jacob Grimm in Karlsruhe in 1814.|$|E

500|$|Coleridge {{was living}} {{apart from his}} family in 1802 During this period he {{intended}} to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> for Sara Hutchinson, {{with whom he had}} fallen in love. He sent her the verse on 4 April 1802. The original draft was titled [...] "Letter to Sara Hutchinson", but renamed as Dejection when published. There are many differences between the versions. The original consisted of 340 lines; when published, 139 lines were cut to emphasise two moments in Coleridge's emotional struggle, while many personal elements were removed. The poem was published in The Morning Post on 4 October 1802. The date corresponds with Wordsworth's marriage to Mary Hutchinson.|$|E
500|$|Fundraising for {{the statue}} {{had begun in}} 1882. The {{committee}} organized {{a large number of}} money-raising events. As part of one such effort, an auction of art and manuscripts, poet Emma Lazarus was asked to donate an original work. She initially declined, stating she could not <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> about a statue. At the time, she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled anti-Semitic pogroms in eastern Europe. These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced. She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue. The resulting sonnet, [...] "The New Colossus", including the iconic lines [...] "Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free", is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty and is inscribed on a plaque in the museum in its base.|$|E
500|$|In 1893 at the World's Congress of Representative Women, {{held at the}} {{beginning}} of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Coolbrith was described by Ella Sterling Cummins (later Mighels) as [...] "the best known of California writers... who stands peerless at the head." [...] Coolbrith was commissioned to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> for the Exposition, and in October 1893 she brought with her to Chicago the poem [...] "Isabella of Spain" [...] to help dedicate Harriet Hosmer's sculpture Queen Isabella which stood before the Pampas Plume Palace within the California Pavilion. Listening to Coolbrith were well-known women such as suffragist Susan B. Anthony and journalist Lilian Whiting. During Coolbrith's visit, Charlotte Perkins Stetson, her friend from the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association (the two women served as president and vice-president, respectively), wrote to May Wright Sewall on her behalf; Stetson observed that Coolbrith could benefit from introductions to Chicago's best writers.|$|E

500|$|Whitman {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by deism. He denied any one faith {{was more important}} than another, and embraced all religions equally. In [...] "Song of Myself", he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them—a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem [...] "With Antecedents", affirming: [...] "I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception". In 1874, he was invited to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> about the Spiritualism movement, to which he responded, [...] "It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude [...]" [...] Whitman was a religious skeptic: though he accepted all churches, he believed in none. God, to Whitman, was both immanent and transcendent and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development. American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who [...] "took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world." ...|$|E
