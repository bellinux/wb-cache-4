5|$|Screensavers were {{designed}} {{to ensure that there}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> phosphor burn-in of images left on a CRT-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic interactivity with its series of screensaver products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia.|$|E
5000|$|At {{least one}} scholar {{has argued that}} Khomeini's [...] "decrees, sermons, interviews, and {{political}} pronouncements" [...] have outlasted his theological works {{because it is the}} former and not the latter that the Islamic Republic of Iran [...] "constantly reprints." [...] Without the decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements [...] "there <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>no</b> Khomeinism ideology. Without Khomeinism there <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>no</b> revolution.

5|$|An {{agreement}} {{exists between}} BAA and West Sussex County Council preventing {{the building of}} a second runway before 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the Department for Transport, at which proposals for additional facilities and runways were considered. It was agreed that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> further expansion at Gatwick unless it became impossible to meet growth targets at London Heathrow Airport within existing pollution limits.|$|E

Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from the USS Hancock then began to land to extract the ground security force.|$|E
5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005.

The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> alternate winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 Labour {{leadership}} election, Andy Burnham {{said that}} he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership. A graduate tax has been criticised because there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> way to recover the money from students who move to a different country, or foreign students who return home.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, the Museum Society raised $40,000 {{to mount}} the grand portal of the old church. It was {{installed}} in the de Young Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall. The rest of the stones were abandoned by the museum in May 1969 with the announcement that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reconstruction. After this, stones were occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status, with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 The Guardian {{published}} {{an open letter}} from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position. In July that year Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> prosecution because of the medical disagreement between the three pathologists. Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.|$|E

5|$|In this context, a {{dependency}} graph is a graph {{that has}} a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency, and is generally not allowed, because there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle.|$|E
5|$|James Richard Ellis {{has argued}} that the incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if she and her father were animals, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says {{the theory is}} an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E

5|$|Other ideas {{put forward}} and {{discounted}} before the consultation stage included a complete {{restoration of the}} pre-1974 Worcestershire county boundary. This option included Stourbridge and Halesowen, as they were {{under the jurisdiction of}} Worcestershire County Council until 1 April 1974. The LGBCE deemed that this Local Government review did not include metropolitan counties (except a one-off review of Sefton on Merseyside), so there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> change to the boundaries of Dudley Metropolitan Borough.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{revised and}} {{included}} in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared {{the kind of}} bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of Endymion, {{they were willing to}} publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> politically motivated reviews that could give the volume a bad reputation.|$|E
5|$|A gallery feature {{was also}} planned and would allow players to unlock bonus {{material}} {{depending on their}} progression in the game. Fan artwork and music would be unlockable through this feature, as well as minigames, including a card game similar to Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII. The remake {{was expected to be}} released on the Internet for free and played on console emulators, since there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, and the project was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including the accidental loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E
