40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{is widely}} used to determine milk composition. In this study, 1, 060 milk infrared <b>wavenumbers</b> ranging from 925 to 5, 008 cm - 1 of 1, 748 Holstein Friesian cows on 371 herds in the Netherlands were available. The extent to which infrared <b>wavenumbers</b> are affected by genetic and environmental factors was investigated. Inter-herd heritabilities of 1, 060 infrared <b>wavenumbers</b> ranged from 0 to 0. 63, indicating that the genetic background of infrared <b>wavenumbers</b> differs considerably. The majority of the <b>wavenumbers</b> have moderate to high inter-herd heritabilities ranging from 0. 20 to 0. 60. The diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT 1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD 1), κ-casein (CSN 3), and β-lactoglobulin (LGB) polymorphisms {{are known to have}} a large effect on milk composition, and therefore we studied the effects of these polymorphisms on infrared <b>wavenumbers.</b> The DGAT 1 polymorphism had highly significant effects on many <b>wavenumbers.</b> In contrast, the SCD 1 polymorphism did not significantly affect any of the <b>wavenumbers.</b> The SCD 1 is known to have a strong effect on the content of C 10 : 1, C 12 : 1, C 14 : 1, and C 16 : 1 fatty acids. Therefore, these results suggest that FTIR spectra contain little direct information on these monounsaturated fatty acids. The CSN 3 and LGB polymorphisms had significant effects on a few <b>wavenumbers.</b> Differences between herds explained 10 to 25 % of the total variance for most <b>wavenumbers.</b> This suggests that the <b>wavenumbers</b> of milk FTIR spectra are indicative for differences in feeding and management between herds. The <b>wavenumbers</b> between 1, 619 and 1, 674 cm - 1 and between 3, 073 and 3, 667 cm - 1 are strongly influenced by water absorption and usually excluded when setting up prediction equations. However, we found that some of the <b>wavenumbers</b> in the water absorption region are affected by the DGAT 1 polymorphism and lactation stage. This suggests that these <b>wavenumbers</b> contain useful information regarding milk composition. </p...|$|R
25|$|A quick {{heuristic}} way {{of studying}} the scaling {{is to cut}} off the H <b>wavenumbers</b> at a point λ. Fourier modes of H with <b>wavenumbers</b> larger than λ are not allowed to fluctuate. A rescaling of length that make the whole system smaller increases all <b>wavenumbers,</b> and moves some fluctuations above the cutoff.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} with 1 D toy models find significant distortions of the normative Kolmogorov spectrum. Convective instabilities feed in additional energy at intermediate <b>wavenumbers.</b> Furthermore, subtle differences in derivative couplings can spoil the usual intuitive {{picture of the}} Kolmogorov-Richardson cascade.

25|$|To {{restore the}} old cutoff, perform a partial {{integration}} {{over all the}} wavenumbers {{which used to be}} forbidden, but are now fluctuating. In Feynman diagrams, integrating over a fluctuating mode at <b>wavenumber</b> k links up lines carrying momentum k in a correlation function in pairs, with a factor of the inverse propagator.|$|E

25|$|This method {{treats the}} system locally {{as if it}} were uniform with the local properties; in particular, the local wave {{velocity}} associated with a frequency is the only thing needed to estimate the corresponding local <b>wavenumber</b> or wavelength. In addition, the method computes a slowly changing amplitude to satisfy other constraints of the equations or of the physical system, such as for conservation of energy in the wave.|$|E
25|$|These {{distributions}} {{represent the}} spectral radiance of blackbodies—the power emitted from the emitting surface, per unit projected area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per spectral unit (frequency, wavelength, <b>wavenumber</b> or their angular equivalents). Since the radiance is isotropic (i.e. independent of direction), the power emitted {{at an angle}} to the normal is proportional to the projected area, and therefore to the cosine of that angle as per Lambert's cosine law, and is unpolarized.|$|E
25|$|When {{measuring}} optical phonon {{energy by}} experiment, optical phonon frequencies are sometimes given in spectroscopic <b>wavenumber</b> notation, where the symbol ω represents ordinary frequency (not angular frequency), and {{is expressed in}} units of cm−1. The value is obtained by dividing the frequency by {{the speed of light}} in vacuum. In other words, the frequency in cm−1 units corresponds to the inverse of the wavelength of a photon in vacuum, that has the same frequency as the measured phonon. The cm−1 is a unit of energy used frequently in the dispersion relations of both acoustic and optical phonons, see units of energy for more details and uses.|$|E
5000|$|Raman shifts are {{typically}} reported in <b>wavenumbers,</b> which have units of inverse length, as this value {{is directly related}} to energy.

5000|$|The {{calculation}} of the transition <b>wavenumbers</b> {{is more complicated than}} for pure rotation because the rotational constant Bν is different in the ground and excited vibrational states.

30|$|One {{may also}} infer that strong {{multiple}} scattering among the cracks enhances the numerical errors. This {{effect would be}} significant for a high crack density and especially for high <b>wavenumbers,</b> even if the sampling criterion (Section 2) is satisfied. However, we confirmed that changing Δh {{by a factor of}} two does not effectively change the numerical results for Model 3 a for all the considered <b>wavenumbers</b> (figure omitted). This again verifies the accuracy of the present FDM simulations, even up to ϵ = 0.1 and the considered <b>wavenumbers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The result {{obtained}} for R depends {{only on the}} ratio E/V0. This seems superficially to violate the correspondence principle, since we obtain a finite probability of reflection regardless {{of the value of}} Planck's constant or the mass of the particle. For example, we seem to predict that when a marble rolls {{to the edge of a}} table, there can be a large probability that it is reflected back rather than falling off. Consistency with classical mechanics is restored by eliminating the unphysical assumption that the step potential is discontinuous. When the step function is replaced with a ramp that spans some finite distance w, the probability of reflection approaches zero in the limit , where k is the <b>wavenumber</b> of the particle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the table}} below, several flow {{quantities}} and parameters according to Airy wave theory are given. The given quantities {{are for a}} bit more general situation as for the solution given above. Firstly, the waves may propagate in an arbitrary horizontal direction in the x=(x,y) plane. The <b>wavenumber</b> vector is k, and is perpendicular to the cams of the wave crests. Secondly, allowance is made for a mean flow velocity U, in the horizontal direction and uniform over (independent of) depth z. This introduces a Doppler shift in the dispersion relations. At an Earth-fixed location, the observed angular frequency (or absolute angular frequency) is ω. On the other hand, in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity U (so the mean velocity as observed from this reference frame is zero), the angular frequency is different. It is called the intrinsic angular frequency (or relative angular frequency), denoted as σ. So in pure wave motion, with U=0, both frequencies ω and σ are equal. The wave number k (and wavelength λ) are independent of the frame of reference, and have no Doppler shift (for monochromatic waves).|$|E
