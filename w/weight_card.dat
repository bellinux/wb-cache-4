5000|$|The {{original}} United States {{release of}} the album was in a specially-produced clear plastic sleeve. The title Clear Spot was embossed on the front flap, with the record clearly visible inside without a liner. This reflected the title: a [...] "clear" [...] cover with the black vinyl disc as a visible [...] "spot." [...] The original concept was for the disc to be of clear vinyl, but this was abandoned due to financial constraints. The package also included a white card insert, with the band name and credits. For the UK this was a single <b>weight</b> <b>card,</b> but in the US issues this was back-to-back card with radius corners at the foot.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a typical}} New Order release—the sleeve of the CD has no printed {{information}} of its contents and the outer cover has two photographs, one {{on the front and}} one on the back. The front cover shows Peter at his drawing board, whereas the back shows a screen print frame for the Peter Saville Show exhibition poster. The inner sleeve (made of a slightly lighter <b>weight</b> <b>card)</b> shows two photographs (one on front and one on back) of the exhibition artwork in preparation. The disc itself states that The Peter Saville Show Soundtrack was written and produced by New Order and mixed by Merv De Peyer. It also states that the design and photography was by the Graphic Thought Facility. The only indication of a catalogue number is shown on the reverse (shiny) side of the disc. Around the centre hole clearly reads 'DISCTRONICS' and 'SAVILLE 1 01'.|$|E

30|$|There are {{at least}} two reasons why {{improving}} access to information may be insufficient to promote weight loss or improve diet. First, overeating often stems from self-control problems that occur despite full knowledge of consequences (O’Donoghue and Rabin 2000). Second, several informational interventions look at behaviors without evaluating whether the information is absorbed and understood. As our model describes, individuals lag in their knowledge behind best practice techniques. Therefore, there might be a gap between what is recommended and the techniques actually used by people. When people do not understand the underlying process and cannot easily infer the benefits of a particular behavior, the transmission of information might be ineffective. To understand the benefits of health inputs, people would have to understand the complex biological process that determines health risks and the role that using health inputs plays in altering those processes. For instance, Hawthorne at al. (2006) suggest that skills for using nutritional information must be built up before the information provided can be effectively used. In this vein, Prina and Royer (2013) measured the effect of delivering body <b>weight</b> report <b>cards</b> to parents of elementary school students on parental knowledge, obesity-related attitudes and behaviors, and BMI. In this experiment, children were randomized into a control group and three treatment groups. What distinguished the three treatment groups was the received level of information. The authors found that <b>weight</b> report <b>cards</b> are an effective means of transmitting obesity information to parents, since they became more informed. However, they found no changes in parents’ action and self-reported behaviors as a result of having that increased information. Nor did they find any detectable effects on BMI or weight. The authors suggest that to observe meaningful behavioral changes, it is necessary that parental concerns about obesity change. Overall, these results show that the provision of <b>weight</b> report <b>cards</b> is simply not enough to induce behavioral changes, despite the positive effects on parental information.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Composites and hybrid {{composites}} were manufactured from renewable materials {{based on}} jute fibers, regenerated cellulose fibers (Lyocell), and thermo-setting polymer from soybean oil. Three {{different types of}} jute fabrics with biaxial weave architecture but different surface <b>weights,</b> and <b>carded</b> Lyocell fiber were used as reinforcements. Hybrid composites were also manufac-tured by combining the jute reinforcements with the Lyo-cell. The Lyocell composite {{was found to have}} better mechanical properties than other composites. It has ten-sile strength and modulus of about 144 MPa and 18 GPa, respectively. The jute composites also have relatively good mechanical properties, as their tensile strengths and moduli were found to be between 65 and 84 MPa, and between 14 and 19 GPa, respectively. The Lyocell-rein-forced composite showed the highest flexural strength and modulus, of about 217 MPa and 13 GPa, respectively. In all cases, the hybrid composites in this study showed improved mechanical properties but lower storage modu-lus. The Lyocell fiber gave the highest impact strength of about 35 kJ/m 2, which could be a result of its mor-phology. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the Lyocell reinforced composite has the best viscoelasti...|$|R

Not to be outdone, the FAO Schwarz offerings contained two figures in each set (and for a more reasonable price of $89.99, than their usual $125+ range); the [...] "West Point & Annapolis Cadets" [...] and the [...] "Air Force Academy Cadet & American Cadet Alliance Marine". Then the late sixties [...] "Adventures of G.I.

The latter issues were [...] "adventure team" [...] -based sets such as [...] "Black Spider Rendezvous", [...] "Undercover Agent", [...] "Skydive to Danger", and [...] "Eight Ropes of Danger", and featured a fuzz-head, kung fu grip version of the TC figure. Some of the last releases such as Skydive contained a fuzz head, kung fu grip 40th Anniversary body (darker skin tone, head closer to original painted-head) instead of the TC version, and the packaging was of the lighter <b>weight</b> <b>card,</b> closer in design to that used for the Classic Collection-based Adventure Team figures, such as Search For The Yeti.|$|E
50|$|The {{structures}} created {{using this}} method rely on {{nothing more than}} balance and friction {{in order to stay}} upright. Ideally, adhesives or other external connecting methods are not used, and no damage or alterations are made to the cards themselves. The larger the structure, the higher number of balanced cards that could fail and compromise the integrity of the card building. Professional card stacker Bryan Berg claims, however, that the more cards placed on a tower the stronger it becomes, because the <b>weight</b> of the <b>cards</b> pushing down on the base (increasing friction) allows occasional cards to stumble without the entire structure collapsing. He also claims that proper stacking technique allows cards to function as shear walls, giving considerable stability to the structure.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effect of carcass fat on egg production in broiler breeder hens. Two groups of birds were brought into production {{at the same time}} (after a similar period of delay) but with widely different levels of carcass fat. This was accomplished by subjecting one group to restricted dietary energy and increasing daylength and the other to full feed but declining daylength. After reaching peak production the birds were subjected to a 0, 10 or 20 % reduction in energy intake for the remainder of a 36 week production period. Carcass samples taken at sexual maturity, at peak production and after 24 and 36 weeks of lay indicated that the level of carcass fat did not affect egg production adversely. A 20 % reduction in energy intake reduced production of total and settable eggs significantly during the cold winter months but had no effect on production during the summer months. There was a slight but non-significant improvement in egg production and feed efficiency when energy was restricted by 10 % in the summer. Egg size was not affected significantly by energy restriction in either experiment. Under the conditions of these experiments carcass fat had no significant effect on egg production. Egg production and carcass fat were roughly related to energy intake depending upon the season of the year. POULTRY SCIENCE 54 : 200 - 208, 1975 MOST attempts to restrict the feed or energy intake of laying strain hens while in production have resulted in lower egg production and egg <b>weights</b> (Burmester and <b>Card,</b> 1939; Heywang, 1940). It was tempting to explain the results of these early experi-ments by citing the use of high-fiber, low-en-ergy diets which made it difficult for the hens to overconsume energy. More recent studies in which modern laying diets were employed have yielded results similar to the earlier work. Walter and Aitken (1961) reported a reduction in egg production with White Leg-horns when feed was restricted to 80 % of ad libitum controls. McGinnis and Dronawat (1967) found that restricitng feed intake to 90 % of ad libitum controls reduced egg pro-duction and egg weights in most experiments. Similar results were reported by Polin an...|$|R
