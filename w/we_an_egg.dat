40|$|The {{parasitic}} nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis has a {{detrimental effect}} on red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) {{at the individual}} and population levels. Treatment using grit coated with the anthelmintic fenbendazole hydrochloride reduces parasite infection and increases grouse density.

T. longicornis is a free spawning species that releases eggs into the ambient seawater after mating. In contrast, E. herdmani carries <b>eggs</b> in <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> sac until they hatch. The proportion of fertilized eggs within E. herdmani egg sacs {{was significantly higher than}} the freely spawned clutches of T. longicornis. This may be a result of the asymmetrical costs associated with carrying vs. spawning unfertilized eggs. T. longicornis frequently laid both fertilized and unfertilized eggs within their clutch. T. longicornis fertilization was negatively associated with chlorophyll concentration and positively associated with population density in their local habitat. The fertilization status of E. herdmani egg sacs was high throughout the season, but the proportion of ovigerous females was negatively associated with an interaction between predators and the proportion of females in the population. This study emphasizes that, in addition to population level processes, community and ecosystem level processes strongly influence the fertilization success an...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT There {{have been}} studies of {{antihypertensive}} peptides derived from food proteins, {{but very few}} described the production of bioactive peptides from egg proteins. The first 2 antihypertensive peptides isolated in egg were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of ovalbumin.

Implementation of the egg sampling method in 8 of the 16 fields resulted in an average 35 percent seasonal reduction in insecticide use when compared to conventional methods.

40|$|The exosome complex plays {{a central}} and {{essential}} role in RNA metabolism. However, current research on functions of exosome subunit in plants is limited. Here, <b>we</b> used <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> cell-specific promoter-controlled CRISPR/Cas 9 system to knock out RRP 42 which encodes a core subunit of the Arabidopsis exosome and presented evidence that RRP 42 {{is essential for the}} development of female gametophytes. Next, we designed three different amiRNAs targeting RRP 42. The rrp 42 knock-down mutants mainly displayed variegated and serrated leaves, especially in cauline leaves. The internal anatomy of cauline leaves displayed irregularly shaped palisade cells and a reduced density of mesophyll cells. Interestingly, we detected highly accumulated mRNAs that encode xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) and expansins (EXPAs) during later growth stages in rrp 42 knock-down mutants. The mRNA decay kinetics analysis for XTH 19, EXPA 10, and EXPA 11 revealed that RRP 42 had a role in the decay of these mRNAs in the cytoplasm. RRP 42 is localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and RRP 42 is preferentially expressed in cauline leaves during later growth stages. Altogether, our results demonstrate that RRP 42 is essential for the development of female gametophytes and {{plays an important role in}} mesophyll cell morphogenesis...|$|R

60|$|There is another, more theoretical, {{ground for}} rejecting the view we are examining.

Now, it seems clear that, since believing and considering have different effects if one produces bodily movements while the other does not, there must be some intrinsic difference between believing and considering*; for if they were precisely similar, their effects also would be precisely similar. We have seen that the difference between believing a given proposition and merely considering it does not lie in the content; therefore there must be, in one case or in both, something additional to the content which distinguishes the occurrence of a belief from the occurrence of a mere consideration of the same content. So far as the theoretical argument goes, this additional element may exist only in belief, or only in consideration, or there may be one sort of additional element in the case of belief, and another in the case of consideration. This brings us to the second view which we have to examine.|$|R
40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{is challenging}} phenotypic plasticity {{of individuals and}} populations. Calanoid copepods (zooplankton) are shown to be fairly plastic against altered pH conditions, and laboratory studies indicate that transgenerational effects are one mechanism behind this plasticity. We studied phenotypic plasticity of the copepod Acartia  sp. {{in the course of}} a pelagic, large-volume mesocosm study that was conducted to investigate ecosystem and biogeochemical responses to ocean acidification. We measured copepod egg production rate, egg-hatching success, adult female size and adult female antioxidant capacity (ORAC) as a function of acidification (f CO 2  [*]∼[*]  365 – 1231  µatm) and as a function of quantity and quality of their diet. <b>We</b> used <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> transplant experiment to reveal whether transgenerational effects can alleviate the possible negative effects of ocean acidification on offspring development.

We did not find support for the hypothesis that insufficient food quantity (total particulate carbon <  55  µm) or quality (C : N) weakens the transgenerational effects. However, females with high-ORAC-produced eggs with high hatching success. Overall, these results indicate that Acartia sp. could be affected by projected near-future CO 2 levels...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of <b>a</b> nematode parasite <b>egg</b> (Nemata: Oxyurida) from a coprolite {{closely associated with the}} remains of several species of Cynodontia, dated to 240 million years old. This finding is particularly significant because this is the oldest record of an oxyurid nematode yet discovered, and because the cynodonts are considered a stem-group of the mammals. Methods: We extracted material from a fully mineralized coprolite by both scraping the surface, and removing fragments from its interior with clean dental instruments used a single time. A single drop of glycerol from a new vial was added as a clearing reagent. Each slide was sealed with wax and examined with an optical microscope at 100 × to 400 × magnification. Results: From one coprolite, 550 slides were examined; from 275 of these slides, sediment was examined that was scraped {{from the surface of the}} coprolite, and from the other 275 slides, material was examined that was extracted from the interior of the coprolite.
