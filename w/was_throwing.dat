5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local {{leadership}} in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating {{large sums of money}} in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Without {{the benefit}} of a full senior season to show himself off to scouts, Clippard {{proactively}} sent scouts a schedule of when he <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> and attended as many showcases as he could. He trained with Roy Silver, a retired professional baseball player, who worked with Clippard on his mechanics and his maturity. Clippard's father, Bob, teamed up with Tom Kotchman, father of Florida high school player Casey Kotchman, to form showcases with past teammates of Clippard.|$|E
5|$|Due to Nelsen's injury, Gault {{was given}} the start in next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, facing off against fellow rookie and first overall draft pick, Terry Bradshaw. In his only career start, he {{completed}} one pass for 44 yards in 16 attempts, threw two interceptions, and finished {{the game with a}} 0.0 passer rating. He also led the Browns to only three first downs during the first half, and as a result Phipps took over at quarterback; the Browns {{went on to win the}} game, 15-7. Nelsen recovered from the injury the following week and turn back over for the Browns at quarterback; Gault did not play another snap that season. Entering the 1971 season, Gault modified his throwing style after discussion with new head coach Nick Skorich, and <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> better in training camp as a result. After training camp ended, however, he was placed on the practice squad, where he remained throughout the season.|$|E

5|$|During the {{training}} expedition, Shaw's group came to Walla Brook at a crossing near Watern Tor in the north-east of Dartmoor. According to evidence given at Shaw's inquest in 2009, the group {{believed they had}} to cross because the alternative route would add at least four miles to the trek. Another {{member of the group}} got into difficulties crossing the stream, which, due to heavy rain, had swollen to approximately five times its normal size. The other group member removed her rucksack and passed it to Shaw. As Shaw, the last member of the group on her side of the stream, <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the rucksack across, she slipped and fell into the water.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{had three}} quarterbacks on their roster {{entering}} the 1970 season in Gault, Bill Nelsen, and Mike Phipps. As training camp began, Browns coach Blanton Collier {{planned to use}} Gault in exhibition games, as he <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the ball well in practice during the summer. By the end of preseason, Gault {{was named to the}} active roster as the Browns retained all three quarterbacks, an uncommon move at the time. During the Browns' second game against the San Francisco 49ers, starting quarterback Nelsen was injured, leading Gault to enter the game in the fourth quarter. He completed a pass to Gary Collins for 23 yards, threw an incompletion, and threw an interception to Dave Wilcox, allowing the 49ers to go on a game-winning drive in a 34-31 Browns loss.|$|E

25|$|The only {{recorded}} {{evidence of}} his pitching speed stems from 1958, when Dalkowski was sent by the Orioles to Aberdeen Proving Ground, a military installation. Here, using a radar machine, he was clocked at , a fast but not outstanding speed for a professional pitcher. However, several factors worked against Dalkowski: he had pitched a game the day before, he <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> from a flat surface instead of from a pitcher's mound, {{and he had to}} throw pitches for 40minutes at a small target before the machine could capture an accurate measurement. Further, the device measured speed from {{a few feet away from}} the plate, instead of 10 feet from release as in modern times. This cost Dalkowski approximately 9 MPH, not even considering the other factors.|$|E
25|$|Following the game, {{general manager}} Theo Epstein and manager Terry Francona each {{independently}} confirmed {{that they had}} spoken by phone {{to each other in}} the seventh and eighth innings concerning Buchholz' pitch count. He had not thrown more than 98 pitches in a game all year, and was threatening to significantly exceed that total if he finished the game. Epstein reported that in no way would Buchholz have been allowed to face a batter after reaching 120 pitches, expressing concern about excessive pitches potentially damaging such a young and inexperienced arm. Buchholz finished the game with 115 pitches, allowing Francona to escape what would have been an unpleasant decision to remove a pitcher from the game in which he <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> a no-hitter.|$|E

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick. The hips must be rotated more before the kicks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and the body tilts in the direction of the kicks, which can cause a person to lose their balance on the landing.|$|R

5000|$|A given juggling {{pattern is}} {{represented}} by a sequence of digits, like [...] "333", [...] "97531", or [...] "744".

The prop thrown next, the '3', will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'.

500|$|He learned {{baseball}} at {{an early}} age, his biggest rival being Juan González, whom he often played against in his youth.

Rodríguez attended Lino Padron Rivera High School, where he was discovered by scout Luis Rosa. Rosa reported that [...] "He showed leadership at 16 that I'd seen in few kids.
