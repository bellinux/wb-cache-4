The building remains a commercially successful rental office building, as it was when it was first built.|$|E
5|$|Flat Bastion Magazine {{had been}} {{abandoned}} for years when geology enthusiast Freddie Gomez undertook its restoration. Gomez, whose interests include both history and geology, converted the magazine to a geological research facility and exhibition centre. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contents of the large collection of rocks and minerals are from his collection, other specimens have been donated. The men of the 150 (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment also spent a day performing repairs at the magazine. Gomez aspires to open the site to the public.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the major}} {{architecture}} of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes. Some mounds were destroyed {{in order to build}} the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were robbed of stone that was reused in modern construction. There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty. This tension led to a series of succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} in these sites {{is consistent with}} common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what {{seems to have been}} a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{including}} a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried {{over from the}} convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E
5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of}} the Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} the sheep {{industry}} in Australia was explosive. In 1820, the continent held 100,000 sheep, a decade later it had one million. By 1840, New South Wales alone kept 4 million sheep; flock numbers grew to 13 million in a decade. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growth in both nations {{was due to the}} active support of Britain in its desire for wool, both worked independently to develop new high-production breeds: the Corriedale, Coolalee, Coopworth, Perendale, Polwarth, Booroola Merino, Peppin Merino, and Poll Merino were all created in New Zealand or Australia. Wool production was a fitting industry for colonies far from their home nations. Before the advent of fast air and maritime shipping, wool {{was one of the few}} viable products that was not subject to spoiling on the long passage back to British ports. The abundant new land and milder winter weather of the region also aided the {{growth of the}} Australian and New Zealand sheep industries.|$|E
5|$|Most of the storm's {{effects were}} felt in Florida where it made {{landfall}} {{on the morning}} of June 18, causing gales, heavy rains, flooding, beach erosion and tornadoes. The highest winds were recorded at 41mph (66km/h) and up to 48mph (77km/h) during a thunderstorm at Macdill Air Force Base in Tampa on June 18. Rainfall peaked at 10.72inches (272.28mm) in Desoto City, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the state reported between 15inches (25125inches) of precipitation. High tides and waves caused flooding and beach erosion from Naples to the Tampa Bay area. Some waterfront buildings suffered damage from undermining including widespread damage of marinas and some boats. Several bulkheads and rock revetments experienced minor damage in Naples and Marco Island. Several manâ€‘made dune structures seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line in Collier County received minor damage at Vanderbilt Beach and Marco Island. Three people were killed in Florida in association with the subtropical storm with a further thirteen people injured. A Brevard County woman died when a canoe overturned and an Orange County child was killed when he was swept into a drainage ditch. 130 families were evacuated {{a few days after the}} storm from the Arcadia River area because the Peace River crested above flood stage.|$|E
5|$|School House, 70The Close, was {{formerly}} {{part of the}} Carnary college but now contains classrooms and school offices. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building dates to around 1830, extensive 14th and 15th century features remain such as the stone entrance archway. The building, which is Grade I listed, adjoins the Erpingham Gate and is three storeys high and has eight bays. School End House, 69The Close, is a 17th-century timber-framed house built against {{the east end of}} the school chapel. Formerly a home, the Grade I listed building is now the senior common room for staff and a school office. The entrance is pilastered and is surrounded by lion-mask roundels. The Music School, 71The Close, was built in 1626â€“28 as a home for the prebendaries of the cathedral, funded by the chapter. Typical of the period, the Grade II* listed building was constructed from flint-rubble, brick, and reused materials from monastic buildings in the Close. It replaced an earlier house and incorporates the remains of a medieval free-standing bell tower originating in the 12th or 13th century, rebuilt around 1300 and largely demolished by 1580.|$|E

5|$|With the {{increased}} flood protection {{afforded by the}} Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California housing boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the Santa Ana River watershed began its third and final transitionâ€”from agricultural to urban. The population of the Santa Ana River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river's historic floodplainâ€”an area once occupied by farmsâ€”and the river became confined to a narrow channelâ€”a flood {{similar to the ones}} surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also heightened the runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known as urban runoff. In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Damâ€”probably saving Orange County from an even greater floodâ€”Santiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the Santa Ana Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.|$|E
