Detailed mapping of seismic reflectors in part of the basin, when compared with correlations of late Neogene stage boundaries between 11 <b>well</b> <b>sections,</b> has highlighted crossover between the datasets. To help resolve this issue, the biostratigraphy of the Pliocene-Pleistocene parts of each of four <b>well</b> <b>sections</b> (Arawa- 1, Ariki- 1, Kora- 1, and Wainui- 1) has been re-examined using a dense suite of samples. In addition, the biostratigraphy of seven other <b>well</b> <b>sections</b> (Awatea- 1, Kahawai- 1, Mangaa- 1, Taimana- 1, Tangaroa- 1, Te Kumi- 1, and Turi- 1) has been re-evaluated. The crossover is partly attributed to a combination of sampling resolution inherent in exploration <b>well</b> <b>sections,</b> the mixed nature of cuttings samples, and the general scarcity of age-diagnostic planktic foraminifera in the late Neogene formations. The achievement of seismic closure suggests that error in the mapping of the seismic reflectors is not a significant source of the uncertainty (crossover). We have developed a workable time-stratigraphic framework by qualitatively weighting the biostratigraphic data in each of the <b>well</b> <b>sections,</b> thereby identifying the parts of particular <b>well</b> <b>sections</b> with the highest resolution microfossil data and the optimal stratigraphic position of stage boundaries with respect to the mapped seismic horizons/seismic units. Hence, it is possible to assign the known numerical ages for these stage boundaries to reflection horizons/seismic units mapped within the basin. We have applied this information to produce a series of isopach maps for successive stage boundaries that help show the sedimentary evolution of the continental margin succession west of central North Island...|$|R

5000|$|Private {{security}} {{in the province of}} British Columbia is governed by two pieces of legislation: the Security Services Act and the Security Services Regulation. These laws are administered and enforced by the Security Programs and Police Technology Division of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General. The legislation requires that guards must be at least 19 years old, undergo a criminal background check, and successfully complete a training course. As far as weapons, British Columbia law severely restricts their use by security officers.
