25|$|The {{find was}} taken to the farm where Maggie (later Mrs Nicholl) washed the items in a sink. At that time they did not realise they were made from gold. The hoard was {{eventually}} sold to the British Museum for six hundred pounds. It consisted of a miniature ship, complete <b>with</b> <b>fittings</b> and oars; two necklets, a bowl and a torc (or hollow collar). The find was described as a lump of mud when initially shown. Moreover, the boat had been so badly damaged by the plough that it took a goldsmith to later work out its structure.|$|E
25|$|Two {{models that}} have been {{designed}} for military use {{from the ground up}} are the 101 Forward Control from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s. The latter was intended to be transported under a helicopter. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS) teams were early users in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and their convoys of Land Rovers and larger military trucks are a sight often seen in the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes. More recently, vehicles have been painted white, and are issued <b>with</b> <b>fittings</b> similar to civilian UK Mountain Rescue teams.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Merrick {{shut the}} door and called up Skeelty. Five minutes of {{bargaining}} settled the question and he then connected with Mr. Marvin again and directed him to have the presses and machinery equipped to run by electricity.

60|$|And in {{his heart}} of hearts Martin {{understood}} the situation only too well, as he leaned back and gloated at Von Schmidt's head, in fancy punching it well-nigh off of him, sending blow after blow home just right--the chuckle-headed Dutchman! One thing he did like about him, however. Poor as he was, and determined to rise as he was, he nevertheless hired one servant to take the heavy work off of Marian's hands. Martin talked with the superintendent of the Asa agencies, and after dinner he drew him aside with Hermann, whom he backed financially for the best bicycle store <b>with</b> <b>fittings</b> in Oakland. He went further, and in a private talk with Hermann told {{him to keep his}} eyes open for an automobile agency and garage, for there was no reason that he should not be able to run both establishments successfully.|$|E
