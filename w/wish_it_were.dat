It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Some {{felt the}} album was less {{innovative}} than Radiohead's prior albums. Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork called The King of Limbs [...] "well-worn terrain for Radiohead, and while it continues to yield rewarding results, the band's signature game-changing ambition is missed." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers wrote that the album [...] "can be heard from several different angles ... fans and critics have already been registering wildly divergent reactions: some think it's one of the band's best efforts; others find it too low-key or similar to previous work; a few consider it awfully doomy, {{and a few others}} <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> less abstract." [...] Luke Lewis of NME found its lyrics too vague, calling The King of Limbs [...] "a record to respect for its craft, rather than worship for its greatness." [...] In a retrospective 2015 article for Stereogum, Ryan Leas wrote that The King of Limbs is [...] "very good, occasionally great music by a pivotal band that nevertheless felt like something of a letdown because it wasn't, ultimately, some genius stroke none of us expected." ...|$|E

[...] She felt the film had enough surprises [...] "to make you <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> better." [...] Similarly, The New York Times {{reviewer}} A.O. Scott said, [...] " [...] film is smarter than you might expect, {{and at the same time}} dumber than it could be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Through her {{friendship}} with, {{and eventual}} engagement to Edward, at age 15 in June 1856, {{she was able}} to visit the studio where he worked with Rossetti and Morris. She was also introduced to John Ruskin. She said, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> possible to explain the impression made upon me as a young girl whose experience so far had been quite remote from art, by sudden and close intercourse with those to whom it was the breath of life... I felt {{in the presence of a}} new religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{explained}} in the novel as follows: [...] "To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief {{in the existence of}} the world around you {{and the nature of the}} things in it, to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy – to imagine something is real simply because you <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were.</b> A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon the most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burr made {{repeated}} {{trips on}} behalf of the United Service Organizations (USO). He toured both Korea and Vietnam during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of Greenland, Baffinland, Newfoundland and Labrador. Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, [...] "My only position on the war is that I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> over." [...] In October 1967, NBC aired Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam, a documentary of one of his visits. The reception was mixed. [...] "The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing", wrote the Chicago Tribune; the Los Angeles Times called Burr's questions [...] "intelligent and elicited some interesting replies".|$|E

2500|$|... “…Let the hours, {{the minutes}} and the seconds pass as they will, {{as long as}} they do so as quickly as {{possible}} so that I can slap that bocú... From today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to think that there are still so many days to go; I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
2500|$|Keith Uhlich from Slant Magazine was {{positive}} to both season {{one and three}} of Millennium, giving them both {{four out of five}} stars and calling season one: [...] "We are racing toward an apocalypse of our own creation. This is who we are." [...] Mike Drucker from IGN called the second season a combination of the [...] "X-Files and the violent paranoia of Se7en." [...] Variety reviewer Jeremy Gerard compared the show to Twin Peaks and was overall positive to the series, but said [...] "I just <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> a little more fun, that I didn't have this nagging feeling that it wants to hurt me the next time I come around." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B and said it had [...] "great visuals and a commanding performance by Henriksen." [...] Justine Elias from The New York Times was mostly positive to the series and said [...] "If The X-Files, with its offbeat humor and conspiracy theories, wonders about those things that go bump in the night, Millennium explores the darkness – and embraces it." [...] Daily Nebraskan said in their review that the show had [...] "a lot of potential: a good lead actor, a solid premise and a feel that will keep audiences glued to their televisions." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Peterhoff, Maria Pavlovna went to Grand Duchess Elisabeth’s rural estate, Ilinskoe, near Moscow, where Wilhelm {{joined them}} for a month before he left on a cruise to America. The young couple {{maintained}} their intimacy through letters. Maria imagined herself in love: “It’s lovely to have somebody, even far away, who love you more than anything and whom you love more than everybody on earth“, she wrote to him. In October, Wilhelm returned to Russia joining Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri who introduced the Swedish prince to their father, Grand Duke Paul, who was permitted {{to come back to}} Russia for his daughter's wedding set to take place after she turned eighteen the next April. At Wilhelm's departure, Maria wrote to him: [...] " [...] I love you, so much with every day, every hour more and more. I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> April now, how lovely it would be". [...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom". [...] As the wedding day approached, she began to have doubts and wished to break off the engagement, but Princess Irene of Hesse who was visiting her sister, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, persuaded her otherwise. Soon Maria Pavlovna was once again looking forward with enthusiasm to a new life. The wedding took place at Tsarskoye Selo on [...]|$|E
