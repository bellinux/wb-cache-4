5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E
25|$|The Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART), {{founded by}} Baroness Cox in 2003, works to provide lasting change through aid and {{advocacy}} for those suffering oppression and persecution, who are largely neglected {{by the international}} media. HART believe {{that in order to}} adequately meet the needs and requirements of the persecuted, oppressed and overlooked; <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> the local people for their priorities, giving them the dignity of choice and the responsibility of their own programmes. Lady Cox travels to HART funded aid and advocacy programmes in Nagorno Karabagh, East and West Burma, East Timor, India, Nigeria, southern Sudan and northern Uganda. An Australian branch of HART was established in 2009.|$|E
500|$|The goddess Freyja and her afterlife field Fólkvangr, {{where she}} {{receives}} {{half of the}} slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in Gylfaginning where it is said of Freyja [...] "whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain", and interprets Fólkvangr as [...] "the field of the Warriors". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as [...] "filled with many seats"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla.

500|$|The JAMs' promotional tactics were {{similarly}} unconventional, {{including the use}} of promotional graffiti, a guerrilla communication method employed repeatedly by Drummond and Cauty, beginning around the time of their first releases. [...] Some copies of the re-released single were supplied in a picture sleeve which showed The JAMs' [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] graffiti defacing a billboard (advertising the Today newspaper) that depicted police chief James Anderton. [...] Anderton, a self-declared Christian, had courted controversy when he said [...] "I see increasing evidence of people swirling about in a human cesspit of their own making… <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> why homosexuals freely engage in sodomy and other obnoxious practices, knowing the dangers involved" [...] As with much of The JAMs' graffiti, the potency of [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] was derived from the context it in which it was placed. [...] Further graffiti followed, [...] "JAMs" [...] and [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] slogans defacing billboards and Government-funded AIDS warnings in London. [...] The JAMs also made available [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] T-shirts which King Boy D told the NME were [...] "selling like hot cakes". The JAMs later revisited the word [...] "shag" [...] when they named their early career retrospective compilation album Shag Times.|$|E

"The {{power and}} {{prestige}} of America {{is in the}} hands of people who will not resist the temptation to invent new missions, lay down new embargoes, throw new bombs, and fabricate new courts.

2500|$|When {{the time}} came to groom a {{successor}} for the king, {{there seemed to be no}} suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: [...] "You are the rightful king and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> you to come with us to the palace." [...] Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, [...] "I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root." [...] The stick he carried, was of chopo or black poplar, which easily takes root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{controversy}} concerns persons (whether born Jews or {{converts to}} Judaism) who have converted to another religion. The traditional view is such persons remain Jewish. Reform Judaism regards such people as apostates, and states regarding Messianic Jews: [...] "'Messianic Jews' {{claim that they}} are Jews, but <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>asked</b> [...] ourselves whether we identify them as Jews. We can not do so as they consider Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah who has fulfilled the Messianic promises. In this way, they have clearly placed themselves within Christianity. They may be somewhat different from other Christians as they follow various Jewish rites and ceremonials, {{but that does not}} make them Jews." [...] Regardless, such people do not count as Jewish {{for the purposes of the}} Israeli citizenship laws.|$|R

2500|$|The {{facts of}} {{language}} {{in general and of}} speech in particular are, from this perspective, [...] "institutional" [...] rather than [...] "brute". The semantic meaning of a word, for example, is whatever its users imagine it to be. To [...] "do things with words" [...] is to operate in a virtual world which seems real because we share it in common. In this incorporeal world, the laws of physics, chemistry and biology do not apply. That explains why illocutionary force can be deployed without exerting muscular effort. Apes and monkeys inhabit the [...] "brute" [...] world. To make an impact, they must scream, bark, threaten, seduce or in other ways invest bodily effort. If they were invited to play chess, they would be unable to resist throwing their pieces at one another. Speech is not like that. A few movements of the tongue, under appropriate conditions, can be sufficient to open parliament, annul a marriage, confer a knighthood or declare war. To explain, on a Darwinian basis, how such apparent magic first began to work, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> how, when and why Homo sapiens succeeded in establishing the wider domain of institutional facts.|$|E
