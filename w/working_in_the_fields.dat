5|$|The IAPT's {{primary purpose}} is the {{promotion}} {{and understanding of}} biodiversity—the discovery, naming, classification, and systematics of plants—for both living and fossil plants. Additionally, it promotes the study and conservation of plant biodiversity, and works {{to raise awareness of}} the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of plant systematics, taxonomy, and nomenclature. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.|$|E

Letters described beatings Chen {{and his wife}} were subjected to, seizure of documents and communication devices, cutting off of electric power to their residence, and placing of metal sheets over the windows of their house. Harassment of Chen's family continued throughout his house arrest, and extended to Chen's six-year-old daughter, who was briefly banned from attending school and had her toys confiscated by guards, and to Chen's mother, who was harassed while <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> Authorities reportedly told Chen that they had spent 60 million yuan ($9.5 million) to keep him under house arrest.|$|E
5|$|The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre. Her {{estate was}} sold and Olga {{purchased}} Knudsminde, {{a farm in}} Ballerup about 15miles (24km) from Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds. They kept horses, in which Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, chickens, geese, dogs and cats. For transport they had a small car and a sledge. Tihon and Guri (age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they moved to Knudsminde) {{grew up on the}} farm. Olga ran the household {{with the help of her}} elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka"), who had come along with her from Russia. The Grand Duchess lived with simplicity <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> doing household chores and painting.|$|E

5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E

25|$|Like all Latrodectus species, L. tredecimguttatus has {{a painful}} bite that is fatal in rare cases.

25|$|As parish priest, Vianney {{realized}} that the Revolution's aftermath had resulted in religious ignorance and indifference, due to the devastation wrought on the Catholic Church in France. At the time, Sundays in rural areas were spent <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> or dancing and drinking in taverns. Vianney spent time in the confessional and gave homilies against blasphemy and paganic dancing. If his parishioners did not give up this dancing, he refused them absolution.|$|E
25|$|Hume {{was very}} {{interested}} in the development of agriculture. He believed that there was too much focus on obtaining revenue and no effort had been spent on improving the efficiency of agriculture.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of colonialism and Christianity, rigid ideals about gender perceptions were imposed on the African mind. Thereafter, the woman’s role {{has come to be}} limited to sexual and commercial labour; satisfying the sexual needs of men, <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> carrying loads, tending babies and preparing food. The disempowering colonial ‘ideology of domesticity’ as espoused by the practice of ‘housewification’ provided the springboard for women’s educational imbalance in parts of Africa. As such, the overall human development in Nigeria is being hindered by this unevenness in educational accessibility across gender categories.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{tower was}} {{certainly}} an effective protection against surprise attacks by smaller marauding gangs {{and the local}} population. Often a castle was vulnerable just through {{the absence of a}} few able-bodied men whilst they were out hunting or <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> Even without supplies the remaining castle residents could hold out in the bergfried until the return of their menfolk and were protected from abuse and rape. The safe refuge of the bergfried was certainly very welcome at a time when state and social structures were just beginning to take shape.|$|E
