5|$|Taxonomy in the Middle Ages {{was largely}} based on the Aristotelian system, with {{additions}} concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the Great chain {{of being in the}} Western scholastic tradition, again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, {{due to the lack of}} microscope at the time, as his ideas were based on arranging the complete <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single continuum, as per the scala naturae (the Natural Ladder). This, as well, was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being. Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius, Timotheos of Gaza, Demetrios Pepagomenos, and Thomas Aquinas. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} Ferelden, one {{of several}} {{countries}} in the fictional world of Thedas.

Every few hundred years, the Darkspawn swarm the surface <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> movement known as a Blight. Ever since the first Blight, Thedas has relied on the legendary order of warriors known as the Grey Wardens to drive the Darkspawn back. Dragon Age: Origins begins on the eve of Thedas's fifth Blight.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that other deities did not.|$|E

5|$|Verne {{began playing}} {{with the idea of}} {{bringing}} a mixed selection of Voyages Extraordinaires characters together on a new adventure in early 1875, when he considered writing a novel in which Samuel Fergusson from Five Weeks in a Balloon, Pierre Aronnax from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Phileas Fogg from Around the World in Eighty Days, Dr. Clawbonny from The Adventures of Captain Hatteras, and other characters would go around the world together in a heavier-than-air flying machine. Another novel featuring a similar trip around the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flying machine, Alphonse Brown's La Conquête de l'air, was published later that year, causing Verne to put the idea on hold. The idea, in highly modified form, finally reemerged five years later as Journey Through the Impossible.|$|E

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{games have}} an overall upbeat feeling. The typical Dragon Quest plot {{involves}} the player controlling {{a party of}} heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plot-line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters. This linear plot-line is intentional, to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them. The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when, and whether, to pursue certain storyline paths. To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and, to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether {{they are on the}} right path, the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced {{at the beginning of the}} game. While the player never starts the game in a wholly non-linear way, they usually allow players to explore an open <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-linear manner following an early linear section of the game. Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels, although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases.|$|E

5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen {{as a reaction to}} the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} days tourism was a {{relatively}} new concept, but grew slowly before exploding {{with the advent of}} air travel around 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations, and Kīlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more or less constant state of moderate eruption, is {{a major part of the}} island's tourist draw. Today, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offers the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access. In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in Kalapana on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.|$|E

5|$|Influenza spreads {{around the}} <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} {{in about three}} to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur {{at any time of}} the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E
5|$|Ron Springett was the goalkeeper for England as Banks rose to prominence, {{but after}} the 1962 World Cup in Chile, a new coach was {{appointed}} in former England right-back Alf Ramsey. Ramsey demanded sole control of the team and began looking towards the next World Cup. Banks won his first cap on 6 April 1963 against Scotland at Wembley, after Springett was dropped following a poor performance. England lost 2–1, though Banks was blameless as Scotland's goals came firstly from an error by Jimmy Armfield and then secondly from the penalty spot. He was picked for the next match against Brazil, which ended in a credible 1–1 draw after Bryan Douglas cancelled out Pepe's opener. Banks continued to play consistently to become established as England's first-choice goalkeeper. In 1963, he was picked to play against the Rest of the <b>World,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> celebration match to mark 100 years of The Football Association.|$|E
