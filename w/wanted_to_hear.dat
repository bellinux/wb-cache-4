5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what he would say, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, GMG radio {{conducted}} {{market research}} into the type of music that listeners in the north-west of England <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> on the radio. The study concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name Jazz, and as a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 1 March. In 2005, GMG rebranded the London station 102.2 Smooth FM. The two renamed stations played {{middle of the road}} music, soul and R during the day and as part of their licence requirements, jazz music at night.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, 2008, Dutch crime {{reporter}} Peter R. de Vries {{claimed that}} he had solved the Holloway case. De Vries stated that he would tell all on a special television program on Dutch television on February 3. On February 1, the Dutch media reported that Van der Sloot made a confession regarding the disappearance of Holloway. Later that day, Van der Sloot stated that {{he was telling the}} individual what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> and that he had no role in her disappearance. That same day, the Aruba prosecutor's office announced the reopening of the case.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> and they cloaked themselves {{under the cover of}} Chinese nationalism.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{feared that}} {{continued}} {{involvement in the}} war was a mistake that was endangering Johnson's presidency, but he felt too intimidated by the imposing Johnson to share his true feelings. Strauss immediately regretted withholding his true opinion from Johnson. He resolved that if any president ever sought his advice again, Strauss would tell him the truth regardless of what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E
25|$|With a new name, {{exactly the}} same sound they had before and several new songs written, Creed began playing locally. They {{initially}} struggled to get gigs in their hometown because no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> post-grunge bands, so they {{set up their own}} shows at family restaurants and got all their friends to hand out fliers so people would come to these restaurants to watch them play.|$|E

25|$|Jerome Hagen {{indicates}} that War Minister Anami's revised briefing was partly based on interrogating captured American pilot Marcus McDilda. Under torture, McDilda {{reported that the}} Americans had 100 atomic bombs, and that Tokyo and Kyoto {{would be the next}} atomic bomb targets. Both were lies; McDilda was not involved or briefed on the Manhattan Project and simply told the Japanese what he thought they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E

25|$|When McCarthy {{became a}} {{dominant}} voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed {{thousands of dollars}} to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In the Senate race of 1952, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the GOP ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, running for the Senate seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1989, James befriended Grant Wilson-Claridge {{when they}} were working {{alternate}} weeks as a DJ at the Bowgie pub near Newquay. Wilson-Claridge was intrigued by his sets, and when he discovered that James was playing tapes of his own music he suggested that they make records. At first, putting Aphex Twin’s recordings on vinyl {{was a way of}} making music the duo's friends wanted to hear; because of their geographic isolation they could not access the music they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> so they decided to create their own.|$|E

25|$|The pope still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Molay's {{side of the}} story, and {{dispatched}} two cardinals to Paris in December 1307. In {{front of}} the cardinals, Molay retracted his earlier confessions. A power struggle ensued between the king and the pope, which was settled in August 1308 when they agreed to split the convictions. Through the papal bull Faciens misericordiam, the procedure to prosecute the Templars was {{set out on a}} duality, whereby one commission would judge individuals of the Order and a different commission would judge the Order as a whole. Pope Clement called for an ecumenical council to meet in Vienne in 1310 to decide the future of the Templars. In the meantime, the Order's dignitaries, among them Molay, were to be judged by the pope.|$|E

25|$|At first, {{his return}} to Venice was a cordial one {{and he was a}} celebrity. Even the Inquisitors <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> how he had escaped from their prison. Of his three {{bachelor}} patrons, however, only Dandolo was still alive and Casanova was invited back to live with him. He received a small stipend from Dandolo and hoped to live from his writings, but that was not enough. He reluctantly became a spy again for Venice, paid by piece work, reporting on religion, morals, and commerce, most of it based on gossip and rumor he picked up from social contacts. He was disappointed. No financial opportunities of interest came about and few doors opened for him in society as in the past.|$|E
25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, there was a long silence. An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. Everyone <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E
25|$|To rebuild cross-strait ties {{after the}} Sunflower Movement protests, Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun arrived in Taiwan on June 25 for a four-day visit {{as part of}} the 2014 Wang-Zhang Meeting. Zhang met with his Taiwanese counterpart, Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi at the Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel, with groups of protesters held back by police cordons. Zhang and Wang agreed to {{establish}} a direct communication mechanism heralded as the first of its kind, which allows concerned officials from both sides to cut through the bureaucracy and make direct calls to discuss important matters. During the visit, Zhang mentioned he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> different voices from the ground, but no meetings had been scheduled with leaders of the Sunflower Movement. Instead, Zhang met with a pre-selected group of students.|$|E

25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
25|$|When Network Ten paid $15million for {{the first}} season of Australian Idol they {{anticipated}} {{it to be a}} critical and financial success like it had been in other countries such as the UK and the USA. When the show aired {{for the first}} time in August 2003 it was a ratings bonanza attracting diverse ranges of viewers, from people wanting the crazy auditions to people who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> great voices. The audition process went through several major cities in Australia including Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Darwin. Australian Idol became the most popular TV show in the country with more ratings than major events such as the AFL Grand Final. The Grand Final at the Sydney Opera House attracted more than 3million viewers. It was listed as the ninth highest rating TV show in Australia in the past century in 2007. The eventual winner of the competition was Guy Sebastian with Shannon Noll finished in 2nd place.|$|E
25|$|Chief of Staff of the United States Army Harold Keith Johnson, and {{subsequently}} historians such as Harry G. Summers, Jr. {{came to see}} US goals as having become mutually inconsistent, because defeating the Communists would require declaring a national emergency and fully mobilising {{the resources of the}} US. General Johnson was critical of Westmoreland's defused corporate style, considering him overattentive to what government officials <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> Nonetheless, Westmoreland was operating within longstanding army protocols of subordinating the military to civilian policymakers. The most important constraint was staying on the strategic defensive out of fear of Chinese intervention, {{but at the same time}} President Lyndon B. Johnson had made it clear that there was a higher commitment to defending Vietnam. Much of the thinking about defense was by academics turned government advisors who concentrated on nuclear weapons, seen as making conventional war obsolete. The fashion for counter-insurgency thinking also denigrated the role of conventional warfare. Despite the inconclusive outcome of the Korean War, Americans expected their wars to end with the unconditional surrender of the enemy.|$|E
