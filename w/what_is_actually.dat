5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing binary stars named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a triple star system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.|$|E

Already available in literature there are extensions that {{take into account the}} impact of NUMA organization of memory, of out-of-order execution, of memory latencies, and to model at a finer grain the cache hierarchy in order to better understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> limiting performance and drive the optimization process.|$|E

25|$|Levantine {{archaeology}} {{also includes}} the study of Phoenician culture, cosmopolitan in character and widespread in its distribution in the region. According to Benjamin Sass and Christoph Uehlinger, the questions of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> Phoenician and what is specifically Phoenician, in Phoenician iconography, constitute one well-known crux of Levantine archaeology. Without answers to these questions, the authors contend that research exploring {{the degree to which}} Phoenician art and symbolism penetrated into the different areas of Syria and Palestine will make little progress.|$|E
25|$|The naïve Roofline {{provides}} just {{an upper}} bound (the theoretical maximum) to performance. Although {{it can still}} give useful insights on the attainable performance, it {{does not provide a}} complete picture of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> limiting it. If for instance the considered kernel or application performs far below the Roofline, it might be useful to capture other performance ceilings, other than simple peak bandwidth and performance, to better guide the programmer on which optimization to implement, or even to assess the suitability of the architecture used with respect to the analyzed kernel or application. The added ceilings impose then a limit on the attainable performance that is below the actual Roofline, and indicate that the kernel or application cannot break through anyone of these celining without first performing the associated optimization.|$|E

25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E

500|$|Much of the comic's {{dark humor}} {{is derived from}} its {{contrasts}} with Half-Life 2: in a depressing, dark vision of a conquered humanity's future, Gordon Freeman becomes a hero and savior; the similarly named Gordon Frohman, on the other hand, is just an average person, improbably cheerful {{to the point of}} stupidity, and somewhat naïve as to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> going on around him. [...] For instance, Frohman fails to realize that his return-addressed letters to Doctor Breen reveal his location, and so result in that location being invaded, bombed, or otherwise compromised.|$|E

500|$|The episode's script parodied {{parents who}} voiced strong {{opposition}} to South Park, portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that {{they fail to}} pay attention to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> going on in their children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the Terrance and Phillip show. This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, [...] "I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E

The caption states the birds shown are from [...] "Ile Decrès", the French name for Kangaroo Island, but there is confusion over <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> depicted. The two adult birds are labelled as a male and female of the same species, surrounded by juveniles. The family-group shown is improbable, since breeding pairs of the mainland emu split up once the male begins incubating the eggs. Lesueur's preparatory sketches also indicate these may have been drawn after the captive birds in Jardin des Plantes, and not wild ones, {{which would have been}} harder to observe for extended periods.|$|E

The message, written by Simon before his mind was completely consumed by the magic of the crown, asks Marceline to forgive him for whatever he does under the crown's influence. The Ice King fails to understand the context, and believes that he has written not a note of apology but lyrics, and attempts to add music to his [...] "song". Overcome by emotion, Marceline cries and begins singing along while the Ice King plays drums, oblivious as to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> going on.|$|E
