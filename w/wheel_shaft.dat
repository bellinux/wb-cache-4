500|$|During {{the ferocious}} night {{fighting}} that occurred as the High Seas Fleet forced {{its way through}} the British rear, the IV Scouting Group encountered the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at close range in the darkness. As the two squadrons closed on each other, the Germans illuminated [...] and [...] and concentrated their fire on the two ships. The two ships were badly damaged and set on fire and forced to retreat, while the Germans also fell back in an attempt to bring the British closer to the battlecruisers [...] and [...] In the melee, the cruiser [...] was hit and sunk by a torpedo launched by Southampton, and München nearly collided with the sinking Frauenlob. She managed to evade the wreck, and she then fired a torpedo at Southampton, but it missed. München was hit another three times during this engagement; two of the hits exploded in the water, causing minor splinter damage. The third shell went through the second funnel and exploded on a funnel support on the other side; one of the shell splinters knocked out the starboard rangefinder. The erratic maneuvering bent a <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> in the , forcing her crew to steer the ship from the steering gear compartment for {{about two and a half}} hours.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} before September 1891, Hayward {{sustained}} a broken stern <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> in an accident while bound from Whatcom to Seattle. [...] At this time, the boat was owned by the Union Pacific and operated {{as part of the}} railroad’s steamship division. [...] After the accident, Hayward was towed to Tacoma, where Union Pacific port captain, one Clancy, ordered that repairs be made. [...] This required the sternwheel to be removed from the boat.|$|E
2500|$|The wreck site lies at a {{depth of}} [...] to [...] of water {{approximately}} [...] off North Head. The wreck site is on sand away from any reef structure and completely intact but significantly buried under the sand to a level approximately the same as what would have been the deck level. It is a small site with just the two boilers (about 800 – 1000mm dia by 2.5m long approx) a broken engine and paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> (shifted by about 1 meter to the starboard) visible above the sand line. The sharp cutting shape of the bow and stern can just be made out with the twin (bow and stern) rudder posts just above the sand level.|$|E

2500|$|The paddlesteamer , {{named after}} the highest of New Hampshire's White Mountains, was {{launched}} in spring 1872 to carry mail, goods, and passengers on Lake Winnipesaukee, under {{the flag of the}} Boston and Maine Railroad. With a hull length of [...] and a beam of [...] she appeared as a typical representative of the North American sidewheelers around {{the second half of the}} century and was the largest steamer on the lake at that time. The huge paddle wheels were driven by a single-cylinder steam engine of [...] at approximately 26 rpm. The power was transferred from the vertical single cylinder to the <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> by the walking beam, high above the upper deck, oscillating in the frequency of the paddle wheels. Known as [...] "The Mount", her kitchen and restaurant service became famous.|$|E
2500|$|First, {{the dog is}} rotated {{forward to}} the [...] "safe" [...] position, and the priming pan pushed open (if it is not already so). After loading a powder charge and ball through the muzzle in the usual way, the {{operator}} takes his [...] "spanner", slips {{it on to the}} square section of the <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft,</b> and turns it until a click is heard (about one half to three-quarters of a revolution), and the wheel is felt to lock in place, whereupon the spanner is withdrawn. What occurs is that when the wheel is turned, the mainspring is tensioned via the chain, which is wound partially around the shaft. The click is the sound of one end of the sear engaging in the blind hole {{on the inside of the}} wheel, as described above, thus immobilising it.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the wheel}} is {{released}} by the sear, the longer arm of the mainspring pulls the chain engaged in it. The {{other end of the}} chain being fixed to the cam on the <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft,</b> the latter rotates at high speed, whilst the rotating cam pushes forward the arm to which the pan cover is attached, thus causing the pan cover to slide forward towards the muzzle of the piece, and the pyrites to fall (under tension of the dog spring) on to the now rotating wheel. That is the second purpose of a sliding pan cover: were the pyrites to engage a stationary wheel, it would almost certainly jam the mechanism: but the built-in delay allows the pyrites to slip off the sliding pan-cover on to an already rotating wheel. A more modern development has been the use of a ball bearing between the wheel and the sear. [...] This design allows a smoother and lighter trigger pull, requiring less force to operate.|$|E

5000|$|Guards on a {{steamboat}} were {{extensions of}} the main deck out from the boat’s main hull. [...] Guards were originally adopted for side-wheel steamboats to protect the paddle wheels {{and to provide a}} mounting point for the outer ends of the paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>shafts.</b> [...] The main deck planking extended out over the guards, and when a steamboat was fully loaded, and sunk deeply in the water, it often appeared that the edges of the guards marked the line of the hull.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nose wheel}} is {{attached}} to the two rear engine mounts by y-shaped steel tubes attached to a steel tube with a shaft that slides freely with the wheel. Cables run underneath the belly directly from fixtures on the rudder pedals to the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft.</b> This gave the ability to steer by pivoting the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> with the rudder pedals. The shock system consisted of six circular bungee cords, sometimes four for softer landings, located {{on either side of the}} nose <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> to ears on the top tube and the bottom shaft connected to the wheel.|$|E

5000|$|In early {{watches the}} pallet fork and the lever were made as {{separate}} components and joined together. In later watches {{they were made}} as a single component {{as shown in the}} picture. The combined component is often referred to simply as the [...] "lever". In a straight line Swiss lever type escapement, the lever is shaped like a 'T' or an anchor, which gives this escapement its alternative name of anchor escapement. The lever is pivoted in the center; in operation it rocks back and forth. [...] On the arms of the 'T' are angled surfaces called pallets which alternately engage the teeth of the escapement's escape <b>wheel.</b> The central <b>shaft</b> of the lever ends in a fork, which gives pushes to the balance wheel's impulse pin, which is set off center in a disk on the balance <b>wheel's</b> <b>shaft.</b> To reduce friction, the pallets are made of precisely shaped pieces of ruby jewel. The pallet which the teeth first contact is called the entry pallet, while the other one is called the exit pallet.|$|R

50|$|On 9 September 1857, {{the ship}} {{was caught up in}} a Category 2 {{hurricane}} while off the coast of the Carolinas. By 11 September, the 105 mph (165 km/h) winds and heavy seas had shredded her sails, she was taking on water, and her boiler was threatening to go out. A leak in one of the seals between the paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>shafts</b> and the ship's sides sealed its fate, and, at noon that day, her boiler could no longer maintain fire. Steam pressure dropped, shutting down both the pumps that had been keeping the water at bay and the paddle wheels that kept her pointed into the wind as the ship settled by the stern. The passengers and crew flew the ship's flag upside down (a sign of distress in the United States) to try to signal a passing ship. No one came.|$|R

5000|$|Ravigneaux-type {{planetary}} gear ({{planetary gear}} with 4 shafts instead of 3) and two clutches {{as used in}} the Lexus GS450h. By switching the clutches, the gear ratio from MG2 (the traction motor) to the <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> is switched, either for higher torque or higher speed (up to 250 km/h / 155 mph) while sustaining better transmission efficiency. This is effectively accomplished in the Generation 3 Prius HSDs (Prius v, Prius Plug-in and Prius c), although the Generation 3 HSD has this second planetary gear set fixed at 2.5:1, rather than switching between 1:1 and 2.5:1 as the [...] "carrier" [...] is held fixed.|$|E
50|$|Cannon pinion - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft,</b> projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this is turned by the center wheel, and drives the minute wheel. While being set it is turned by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is turned by the minute wheel, which is turned by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the cannon pinion directly.|$|E

Donald gets into an argument with the spring, culminating in him hitting the spring with the mallet, but it (the spring) sends it back and knocks him off. Donald gets his head stuck in a gear on the balance <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft.</b> When he finally is free from it, the oscillation makes his body continue to move.|$|E
25|$|In a south-pointing chariot, {{according}} to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road <b>wheel</b> and <b>Shaft</b> C was connected through a direction-reversing gear to the other road <b>wheel.</b> This made <b>Shaft</b> A rotate at a speed that was proportional {{to the difference between}} the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.|$|R
