5|$|B.spinulosa {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It is {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses a major threat to many other Banksia species; and its <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe. This <b>wide</b> <b>distribution,</b> and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{birds have}} pale brown upperparts, lack the dark head found in adults, and have uniform buff underparts {{that can be}} {{confused}} with juveniles of other munia species such as the tricoloured munia (Lonchura malacca) across the Asian and island populations and the black-throated munia (Lonchura kelaarti) in parts of India or Sri Lanka. Populations within their <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> range show variations in plumage color and size.|$|E

3000|$|One can {{see that}} the {{standard}} deviation, representative of the distribution's width, is higher for low averaging times. Additionally, atoms incident with higher kinetic energy are adsorbed with greater vibrational energy, so they display a <b>wider</b> <b>distribution</b> of z-positions. As shown in Figure 7, the <b>wider</b> <b>distributions</b> that come with this higher vibrational energy produce a smaller change in the E [...]...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} cartilaginous fishes off southern Australia, the sparsely-spotted stingaree has a relatively <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> extending from Crowdy Head in New South Wales to Lancelin in Western Australia, including the entirety of Tasmania. Its range has expanded southward {{in the past few}} decades, apparently due to climate change. In Port Phillip, its numbers increased from 1970 to 1991, likely as a result of fisheries depleting its ecological competitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} species of Leucopholiota, L.lignicola, may be {{distinguished}} from L.decorosa by the following characteristics: free gills in L.lignicola compared with adnexed gills in L.decorosa; L.lignicola tends to grow on the wood of Birch, and preferably in old-growth forests; L.lignicola is restricted to boreal forest, compared to L.decorosa that grows in temperate regions; L.lignicola has a <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> throughout northern coniferous forests in Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It has excellent resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses a major threat to many other Banksia species; and its <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their <b>wide</b> <b>distribution,</b> presumed large population, or because {{they are unlikely to}} be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{responsible}} for more snakebite fatalities than any other African snake. This {{is due to a}} combination of factors, including its <b>wide</b> <b>distribution,</b> common occurrence, large size, potent venom that is produced in large amounts, long fangs, their habit of basking by footpaths and sitting quietly when approached.|$|E
5|$|A Trip to the Moon was {{met with}} {{especially}} large enthusiasm in the United States, where (to Méliès's chagrin) its piracy by Lubin, Selig, Edison and others gave it <b>wide</b> <b>distribution.</b> Exhibitors in New York City, Washington D.C., Cleveland, Detroit, New Orleans, and Kansas City reported on the film's great success in their theaters. The film also did well in other countries, including Germany, Canada, and Italy, where it was featured as a headline attraction through 1904.|$|E

5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|Although Geastrum quadrifidum has a <b>wide</b> <b>distribution,</b> {{it is not}} {{a common}} species. European {{countries}} from which the fungus has been reported include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. In Asia, it has been collected in China and Japan. The North American distribution extends from Canada south to Mexico, and includes Hawaii. It is also found in Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, and South America. Because of its rarity, it has been placed on the Regional Red Lists of several European countries, including Montenegro, Denmark, Norway, and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> of this modification {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E

The Houston Post was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby of Houston. The only other major publication to serve the city is the Houston Press—a free alternative weekly with a weekly readership of more than 300,000.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively high productivity, {{which would make}} its population more resilient to fishing pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market. The extent of this trade {{has not yet been}} quantified. Another potential threat is habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|The Rosebowl was {{an account}} of a trip around the world taken by Gibson and his wife in 1951. It {{described}} his visits to cultural institutions and contained ruminations on cultural collections policy. Reflecting on {{the damage caused by}} World War II to cultural artifacts, art and architecture, he advocated a <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> of works of art around the world, to afford them greater protection. He was {{to have an opportunity to}} pursue these views in later roles with the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E
