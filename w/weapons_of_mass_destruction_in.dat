In 1999 India was estimated to have 800kg of separated reactor-grade plutonium, with a total amount of 8300kg of civilian plutonium, enough for approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons. India is not a signatory to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it argues entrenches the status quo of the existing nuclear weapons states whilst preventing general nuclear disarmament.|$|E
