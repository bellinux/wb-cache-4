40|$|Water removal on {{a tissue}} machine becomes {{progressively}} {{more difficult and}} expensive in each successive zone. Since {{a big part of}} the cost is allocated to the drying section, improved water removal in the wet end may lead to huge savings in the manufacturing process. This can be accomplished by selecting proper raw materials and optimizing the treatment of the fibres in the furnish. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to investigate the influence of three particular furnish properties on dewatering of low grammage papers in the forming and press section; fibre species, beating and additives. The focus was to evaluate how the solids content varies as these furnish properties are changed, but also how the quality of the end product is affected. Water removal during suction is affected by the choice of pulp which can be explained by structural differences in the networks caused by differences in the morphology of the fibres. The total area of straight pores between the fibres is much higher for softwood pulps compared to hardwood pulps which will facilitate transport of both water and air through the sheet. Beating has a negative effect on the solids content reached in vacuum dewatering which can be coupled to internal and external fibrillation of the fibres. Water removal during pressing is affected by the choice of pulp controlled by the pore structure of the fibres and the ability to sorb water. More available water before pressing lead to that more water can be removed. Beating mainly delaminates macropores with small effects on micropores. Both water between the fibres and water in macropores is removed during wet pressing.    The dryness after wet pressing is increased by addition of a <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>agent</b> (PAE) to the stock, probably due to crosslinking in the fibre wall. PAE-resins decrease the volume of both micro- and macropores which will leave less water deposited in the fibre wall. Tensile strength is increased with a <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>agent</b> and further increased by addition of a flocculant and a micropolymer to the stock. A lower absorption capacity is achieved with addition of PAE-resins due to formation of covalent bonds in the fibre wall...|$|E
40|$|Many {{grades of}} paper have shifted from acid to {{alkaline}} production conditions. This change excludes {{the usage of}} traditional alum-rosin sizing chemistry. In some cases however, rosin sizing could prove beneficial {{if it could be}} used under neutral to alkaline paper making conditions. One effort toward this goal has been the use of epi-halohydrin modified polyamine/polyaminoamide in place of alum. The optimum sizing conditions, as well as the mechanism that modified polyamines/polyaminoamides use to size rosin, is investigated. Polyethyleneimine modified with epi-chlorohydrin was used in these studies. Rosin dosage was found to be the main variable that controlled the degree of sizing achieved. As the only hydrophobic material added, this was expected. In addition to rosin dosage, the polymer and pH had significant impacts on this sizing chemistry. Laboratory data shows that the synthesis procedure for and structure of polyethyleneimine-epi-cholohydrin (PEI-epi) impacts the degree of sizing achieved. Use of different modification techniques and degrees of modification illustrated several key factory regarding the polymer as a rosin sizing mordant. Prevention or removal of by-products from epi-chlorohydrin imporves the sizing efficiency of PEI-epi with rosin. A critical molecular weight of the PEI-epi was found to be important to sizing. Higher charge density on PEI-epi provides better the sizing efficiency. In addition to the polymer, other important factors where examined. The pH of the stock impacted the degree of sizing and permanency of the sizing achieved. Varying stock pH showed changes in sizing that are consistent with effects seen for rosin retention and of PAE as a <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>agent.</b> Low and high pH levels also caused reversion of the sizing effect. A pilot trial of the PEI-epi-rosin sizing chemistry was conducted at the Herty Foundation. The pilot trial shows that PEI-epi-rosin can reach the required level of sizing for linerboard. Trial results showed that calcium carbonate filled sheets could be sized by this chemistry. No significant impact on strength is seen from the sizing chemistry at the required dosage levels. As would be expected, addition of filler diminishes sheet strength. No sizing reversion was seen from any samples of this trial. Size reversion at low stock pH indicated that acid catalytic cleavage of an ester bond could have been occurring. Addition of acid or base to permanently sized sheets showed significant levels of reversion, similar to that seen for low stock pH sheets. This provides further supporting eviden ce for the formation and importance of an ester bond between rosin and PEI-epi. FTIR spectra were collected for model compounds to further examine the presence and importance of ester bonds. An ester bond was found to form at room temperature with aging or immediately with drying. Further, the ester bonds were found to decrease when the sample was subjected to acidic or basic environments. Solid state NMR was run to demonstrate the presence and importance of ester bonds to sizing in handsheets. Use of a [superscript 13]C labeled fatty acid showed that the ester bond peak dominated when sizing was present. After treatment with sodium hydroxide, the sizing disappeared and much of the ester bond signal shifted to a carboxylic acid or salt. Further solid state NMR of a non-reactive cationic polymer or a fully pre-reacted PEI-epi polymer shows retention of the fatty acid, but no ester bond and no sizing. The sizing mechanism of PEI-epi-rosin sizing appears to be connected to an ester bond formed during drying or with aging. While the amount of rosin retained controls the degree of sizing, retention alone is not enough to give sizing. The most effective pH for this sizing chemistry is near neutral, pH 6 - 8. FTIR and solid state NMR shows that an epichlorohydrin modified polyamine can form ester bonds with fatty acids in handsheets under conditions comparable to papermaking. The presence of residual acid or base in handsheets destroys the sizing effect achieved. Destruction of the sizing by addition of sodium hydroxide parallels the cleavage of many of the ester bonds present. PEI-epi appears to function as a mordant for rosin by creating an ester bond to anchor and help orient the hydrophobic portion of rosin. Ph. D. Advisor: Yulin Deng, Ph. D. Assoc.

40|$|Compounds {{measured}} as AOX in paper mill effluents originate primarily from contaminated or chlorine-treated industrial water, chemical pulps and <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>agents</b> based on epichlorohydrin. The report outlines AOX avoidance measures {{in terms of}} their current stage of advancement, effectivity as well as limitations, potentialities and future prospects. The report is based on an inquiry among 123 paper mills and in-depth studies of 6 representative production plants. Chlorine treatment of industrial water, which was only applied in 9 mills, results in significant increases in AOX levels in surface waters in particular. As early as 1991, paper mills largely changed over to low-AOX or no-AOX <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>agents,</b> with the exception of 3 mills that continued to use high-AOX products. Adoption of low-AOX chemical pulps was intensified considerably, whereas the inputs of fully chlorine-bleached pulps were lowered down to negligible amounts. Modern biological treatment stages are capable of eliminating between 16 % and 65 % of AOX compounds. In the years 1987 / 88 to 1992 / 93, AOX levels were decreased by 31 - 93 %. In view of the successful reduction measures taken in recent years, there remains a very small potential for further AOX decreases in isolated cases. (orig.)

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} techniques {{for the investigation}} of electrical processes in solid dielectrics are reviewed and their respective strengths and weaknesses are discussed, particularly the complementary nature of thermally stimulated current measurements. The successful design and {{construction of a new}} Thermally Stimulated Discharge Current (TSDC) Spectrometer at the University of Southampton is presented and its correct function validated with experimental measurements of the well known and often characterized synthetic polymers low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephtalate (PET). Results were found to correspond well to published data. First TSDC observations of filled and oil impregnated papers are presented. The second aspect of this work is the investigation of natural polymer insulation materials,specifically paper for oil-paper insulation systems. For the first time, electrical insulation papers with filler contents up to 50 % were investigated. Bentonite and talcum were compared as filler materials and found to have negative and positive effects respectively. The superior electrical strength of a talcum filled kraft paper was verified, and a series of constructive modifications was undertaken to further maximise its electrical strength at comparable or improved dielectric performance. An increase in electrical breakdown strength of 20 % to 30 % has been observed, but the substitution of such great amounts of fiber with fillers also lead to a reduction in mechanical strength of the paper. Further trials with chemical additives were conducted to counteract this effect and polyvinyl alcohol and starch were found to enhance the paper strength. Additional trials also comprised sizing agents, guar gum and <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> <b>agents.</b> Uncharged or slightly charged chemical additives provided best results with regard to dielectric performance.

When pressure sum is beyond 135 bars, material basis weight has significant influence on the dispersibility. Pressure sum of 210 bars is the key value that Lyocell content affects the material dispersibility.

30|$|In this study, wood pulp/Lyocell wetlace {{nonwovens}} {{at different}} waterjet pressure sums, Lyocell blend ratios, and basis weights were fabricated, {{and the effects}} of these varied process parameters on the <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> and dispersiblity of materials were investigated. The increase in pressure sum, Lyocell blend ratio, or basis weight results in increasing the <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> of materials. In spite of different basis weights, materials possess similar dispersibility at the pressure sums from 80 to 135 bars. Beyond the pressure sum of 135 bars, material basis weight has significant influence on the required dispersion cycles. The increase in Lyocell content leads to decrease the flush tube cycles and the required flush tube cycles increase slowly under the pressure sum of 210 bars. But above this pressure sum, the cycles for material dispersion increase sharply and the increase in Lyocell content results in increasing the dispersion cycles. Meanwhile, pressure sums have positive linear relationship with material <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> and exponential relationship with material dispersibility. In short, wood pulp/Lyocell (60 / 40) wetlace nonwoven (80  g m− 2) has dispersion critical value with maximum <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> in use around the smallest pressure sum of 190 bars.

This study aims to examine new polymers for future use as wet-strength additive in paper. One of them, a natural biopolymer, has in earlier studies proved to work well as <b>wet</b> <b>strength</b> additive. The objective was to find out in what extent this biopolymer could improve <b>wet</b> <b>strength.</b> A final evaluation was based on mechanical testing of sheets made from bleached Kraft fibres modified by the biopolymer. Wet-strength polymers are used to develop or conserve the mechanical strength of paper when wetted. Wet-strength agents are added in various paper products such as: hand towels, hygiene paper and packaging grades. According to the chemical composition of these agents they can act either as protective agents by preventing fibre swelling and protecting already existing bonds, or they form new and water resistant bonds through reinforcement mechanisms. The natural biopolymer has a structure that {{is very similar to}} the cellulose structure. This fact together with the reactive functions of the biopolymer probably makes it possible to adsorb it to cellulose fibres. Pre-treatments of fibres were done by adding 0. 5 and 2 % biopolymer to the paper pulp. The adsorption was evaluated by measuring the surface charge of pre-treated fibres. This most popular wet-strength today is PAE (poly(aminoamide) - epichlorohydrin)) but it has some drawbacks.
