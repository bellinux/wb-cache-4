5|$|A {{statement}} in the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a detailed <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> was published in December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report {{was introduced in the}} House of Lords, where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> {{published}} by the Chinese government {{from the perspective of}} public diplomacy. The <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> are political documents in which the Chinese authorities state their official stances regarding a variety of domestic and international affairs. The study approaches the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> from the theoretical perspective of public diplomacy and framing theory. Through the study, the present research endeavours to examine the public diplomacy functions of the <b>White</b> <b>Papers.</b> This thesis also examines how the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> attempt to frame various controversial questions regarding China and its place in the world. The present study employs both quantitative and qualitative methods in the analysis of the <b>White</b> <b>Papers.</b> On the one hand, word cloud and word counter software are used to paint a general picture regarding the contents of the <b>White</b> <b>Papers.</b> On the other hand, <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> on four themes of special interest have been selected for deeper, qualitative analysis: defence, human rights, China’s peaceful development and Tibet. The study shows that the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> predominantly employs the frame of development when discussing China. Although the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> on many occasions admit the imperfection of the Chinese society, they maintain that China is constantly developing into a better society in all aspects. This frame of development is also the main thrust from the perspective of public diplomacy. The central contradiction is that while the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> promote a mutually beneficial relationship between China and other countries, they argue that China has certain, mostly territorial, entitlements due to historical reasons. Regarding territorial issues, including Tibet, the rhetoric of the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> is very uncompromising. Fruitful areas for future research include the continued qualitative study of the <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> and the examination {{of the role of the}} <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> in Chinese politics...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>white</b> <b>papers</b> in {{high-tech}} industries continues to grow. As {{they are currently}} used, <b>white</b> <b>papers</b> represent an intersection of technical documentation with marketing communication. Here, Willerton describes the growing importance of <b>white</b> <b>papers</b> as a genre relevant to technical communicators, and demonstrates a theoretical and methodological approach, schema theory, and case study methodology that could enrich the way some technical communicators undertake audience analysis. He shows how people read and use documents in the workplace, thus offering another window onto real-world workplace practices. Also, he offers one of the delights of qualitative research when {{he points out that}} his participants often read <b>white</b> <b>papers</b> sequentially, rather than skimming the contents...|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy <b>White</b> <b>Paper.</b> The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased {{the profile of the}} issue.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab {{resistance}} and violence to this influx of immigrants {{came to a head}} in 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed, one Arab and one Jewish, which would divide the country between them. Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in the <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> of 1939.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of the Churchill <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by Lord Islington.

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the <b>White</b> <b>Paper,</b> the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E

5|$|The 1987 <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> {{was seen}} by many as an attempt to {{strengthen}} Australia's relationship with the United States, which had been damaged by New Zealand's stance against nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with this policy, the RAN was structured to become more self-reliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia's local region.|$|E
5|$|The 2016–17 budget {{forecasts}} that defence expenditure will increase to $39.3 billion in 2019–20, which {{is estimated to}} represent 1.97% of GDP. This reflects a bipartisan commitment to increase defence expenditure to 2% of GDP. The 2016 Defence <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> included a commitment to further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Labor Party Governments led by Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard between 2007 and 2013 {{commissioned}} two defence white papers, {{which were}} published in 2009 and 2013. The 2009 document, , had a focus on responding to China's rapidly growing influence. It included commitments to expand the RAN, including acquiring twelve submarines, and increasing defence spending by three percent per year in real terms. This increase in spending did not occur, however. The Defence <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> 2013 had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances. As part of an election commitment, the Liberal-National Party Abbott Government commissioned a further defence <b>white</b> <b>paper</b> that was published in 2016. This document also included a commitment to expand the ADF's size and capabilities.|$|E

5|$|This revised {{proposal}} was continued in a further <b>white</b> <b>paper</b> in March 1970, although this {{proposed that the}} counties be unitary authorities which would have no district councils below them. The incoming Conservative government resurrected two-tier local government in a consultative document published in February 1971, again with the same upper-tier boundaries. Some minor changes having been made to the existing county boundaries due to special local factors, the Local Government Act 1972 duly created Clwyd as a merger of Flintshire with most of Denbighshire, along with the Edeyrnion Rural District from Merionethshire. The 1970 <b>white</b> <b>paper</b> had introduced the name of Clwyd by reference to the River Clwyd and the Clwydian range of hills; Clwyd was the only new Welsh county which did not take its name from an ancient kingdom.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, two new {{aircraft}} carriers were planned. The {{requirements for the}} intended force of four carriers meant that five squadrons of Phantoms would be needed. However, in its 1966 Defence <b>White</b> <b>Paper,</b> the Government decided to cancel the two new carriers, which led to reductions in the total order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers. The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E
