25|$|Approximately {{three percent}} of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering</b> from {{alcoholism}} experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis {{is due to the}} long-term effects of alcohol resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} that this problem of AIDS cannot be {{overcome}} merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, {{that is to say}} a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering,</b> a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.|$|E
25|$|Prescription {{drugs and}} medical {{appliances}} {{are available to}} all for a small fee (medical card holders), reduced cost (Drugs Payment Scheme) or in certain circumstances free (under the Long Term Illness Scheme) to residents of Ireland. The Drugs Payment Scheme ensures that every household only has to pay a maximum of €144 per calendar month for up to one month's supply of prescribed medicines and medical appliances. Some private health insurance plans provide partial reimbursement up to the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold. Those who {{are entitled to a}} medical card pay a government levy for each item dispensed. The levy is €2.50 for under 70s and €2.00 for over 70s, up to a maximum of €25/€20 per family per calendar month. Those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering</b> from one of a list of 16 long-term illnesses do not have to pay for medicines or medical appliances related to their conditions. Ireland has below average use of generic medication according to the OECD, despite being a major exporter.|$|E

25|$|Those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering</b> most keenly, and {{who have}} lost most, either of their {{children}} by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, a {{memorial}} {{was created in}} Stockholm to honor Wallenberg. It was unveiled by King Carl XVI Gustaf, at a ceremony attended by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his wife Nane Maria Annan, Wallenberg's niece. At the unveiling, King Carl XVI Gustaf said Wallenberg is [...] "a great example {{to those of us}} who want to live as fellow humans". Kofi Annan praised him as [...] "an inspiration for all of us to act when we can and to have the courage to help those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering</b> and in need of help".

500|$|Amṛtacandra {{says that}} animals {{should not be}} killed for guests or persons deserving respect as often {{advocated}} in certain scriptures. It is also a wrong belief that wild animals that kill many other animals should be killed. This is often justified {{in the name of}} hunting of ferocious animals like tigers for sport. Another wrong belief forwarded to justify killing of ferocious animals is that, these kill many lives and accumulate grave sins and hence killing them is an act of mercy. According to Jainism, killing can never be an act of mercy. It is also a misconception to believe that it is advisable to kill those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering</b> so that they may get relief from agony. These sorts of arguments are forwarded to justify killing of those animals that may have become old or injured and hence have become commercially useless.|$|E
500|$|Other nationalists {{had high}} hopes for the German {{unification}} movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, [...] "The progress of humanity seems to {{have come to a}} halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation [...] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." [...] Garibaldi looked to Germany for the [...] "kind of leadership , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering</b> wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression." ...|$|E

In response to Ugandans saying that the film was out-of-date, Jacob stated that, [...] "It is not too late, because all this fighting and suffering {{is still going on}} elsewhere. Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know about it. Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>suffering</b> over there? They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E

[...] "In fact, my struggle with depression as a student was no secret. I had talked {{about it in a}} widely-covered news conference as early as 1977, when I was in the South Carolina State Senate. Since then, I have often shared with appropriate groups the full story of my recovery to responsible adulthood as a professional, political and civic leader, husband and father.
