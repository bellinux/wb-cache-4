5|$|The predation-avoidance {{behavior}} of sleeping <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> open, allowing one brain hemisphere to remain aware {{while the other}} half sleeps, was first demonstrated in mallards, although it {{is believed to be}} widespread among birds in general.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|Pinto Colvig as Grumpy and Sleepy in a dual role: Grumpy {{initially}} disapproves of Snow White's {{presence in}} the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of {{the threat posed by}} the Queen and rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs and is frequently seen <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> shut. Sleepy is always tired and appears laconic in most situations. Sterling Holloway, who would later voice many other characters for future Disney films was originally considered to voice Sleepy by Walt Disney.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{resistance}} revived {{under the}} rule of the Cometopuli dynasty, but the new emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal. Basil's first expedition against Bulgaria, however, resulted in a humiliating defeat at the Gates of Trajan. For the next few years, the emperor would be preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia, while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans. The war dragged on for nearly twenty years. The Byzantine victories of Spercheios and Skopje decisively weakened the Bulgarian army, and in annual campaigns, Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds. At the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 the Bulgarians were annihilated: their army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded, with the hundredth man left <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> so he could lead his compatriots home. When Tsar Samuil saw the broken remains of his once formidable army, he died of shock. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered, and the country became part of the Empire. This victory restored the Danube frontier, which had not been held {{since the days of the}} emperor Heraclius.|$|E

Moving the eyes prevents the formation of afterimages and the occurrence of Troxler's fading.|$|R

25|$|Libertine Grimm {{is another}} gothic {{character}} who {{is actually an}} amalgam of many different women. She is sexy, erudite and possessed of an extraordinary wit, but this is counterbalanced by an unhealthy appetite for self-destruction and flights of morbid fancy, brought on by dark secrets, terribly chic drugs and wild, sexual abandonment. She is a gluttonous Miss Muffet; the fairy-tale girl who ate the Big Bad Wolf; and the beauty who slept <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> on the coming talent. Libertina Grimm is every goth girl's coven mistress.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} phase of the story, Horus competes with Set for the kingship. Their {{struggle}} encompasses {{a great number of}} separate episodes and ranges in character from violent conflict to a legal judgment by the assembled gods. In one important episode, Set tears out one or both of Horus' eyes, which are later restored by the healing efforts of Thoth or Hathor. For this reason, the Eye of Horus is a prominent symbol of life and well-being in Egyptian iconography. Because Horus is a sky god, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> equated with the sun and the other with the moon, the destruction and restoration of the single eye explains why the moon is less bright than the sun.|$|E
25|$|The {{correlates}} of sleep found for mammals are valid for birds as well i.e. bird sleep {{is very similar}} to mammals and involves both SWS and REM sleep with similar features, including closure of both eyes, lowered muscle tone, etc. However, the proportion of REM sleep in birds is much lower. Also, some birds can sleep <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> open if there is high predation risk in the environment. This gives rise to the possibility of sleep in flight; considering that sleep is very important and some bird species can fly for weeks continuously, this seems to be the obvious result. However, sleep in flight has not been recorded, and is so far unsupported by EEG data. Further research may explain whether birds sleep during flight or if there are other mechanisms which ensure their remaining healthy during long flights in the absence of sleep.|$|E

Although more conventional artwork was created for the film, featuring the main characters' faces emblazoned over the Golden Gate Bridge, Wiseau chose the [...] "Evil Man" [...] for what he regarded as its provocative quality; {{around the time of}} the film's release, the image led many passers-by to believe that The Room was a horror film.

500|$|On {{developing}} the mobile phone version of Crash Boom Bang!, producer Elodie Larre described adapting a party {{game for the}} mobile phone as a [...] "big challenge". Not wanting to make [...] "another multiplayer game where the players just pass the phone to each other" [...] and hoping to attract both old and new fans of the series, the development team decided to integrate the mobile phone itself into the minigames, creating such minigame gimmicks as playing with one hand behind the back, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> closed, playing with the chin, etc. The biggest challenge for the team was keeping the minigames inside the phone's memory, which was cited as slightly inferior to the first PlayStation console. The WarioWare series was described as an influence in making the game.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Riley's birth, {{the family}} moved into a larger house in town. Riley was [...] "a quiet boy, not talkative, who would often go about <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> shut as he {{observed}} and speculated." [...] His mother taught him {{to read and write}} at home before sending him to the local community school in 1852. He found school difficult and was frequently in trouble. Often punished, he had nothing kind to say of his teachers in his writings. His poem [...] "The Educator" [...] told of an intelligent but sinister teacher and may have been based on one of his instructors. Riley was most fond of his last teacher, Lee O. Harris. Harris noticed Riley's interest in poetry and reading and encouraged him to pursue it further.|$|E
