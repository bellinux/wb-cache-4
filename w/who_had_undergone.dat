5|$|At 4p.m. PDT on May 22, the European Space Agency and Italian Space Agency {{arranged}} for a call to Endeavour by Pope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by {{the discovery of a}} gash in the Shuttle's fuselage—the Pope extended his blessing to Kelly's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> skull surgery earlier in the week.

5|$|Construction {{began on}} 16 March 2005 when Sonia Gandhi laid the {{foundation}} stone. Two days prior, the Central Government had named the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> pilot training in Hyderabad. The naming resulted in opposition from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). At Begumpet Airport, the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at the new airport. However, the new airport has only one terminal.|$|E
5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E

The questions to be addressed are: 1. What analgesics (or combination of analgesics) are effective for the treatment of post-operative pain in children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> a tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, or both? 2. What adverse effects, if any, are {{associated with the use of}} individual or combined analgesics for treatment of post-operative pain in children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> a tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, or both...|$|R
5|$|The Front for Victory {{recovered}} {{the majority in}} both chambers of the Congress during the 2011 presidential elections, when Cristina Kirchner was re-elected for a second term. The party had projects to amend the constitution and allow indefinite reelections, but lacked the supermajority required for it. A victory at the 2013 midterm elections would have given such majority, but the party was defeated in most provinces. Sergio Massa, a former cabinet minister of the Kirchners, won in the Buenos Aires Province by nearly 10 points with his new party, the Renewal Front. Argentina lacked a big opposition party {{since the collapse of}} the Radical Civic Union in 2001. Instead, Massa created an alternative party that also stood for Peronism. However, the party still retained a simple majority in Congress. This election was the first one where teenagers from 16 to 18 could vote. President Kirchner, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> brain surgery some weeks before, was hospitalized during the election and unable to join the campaign.|$|E

25|$|The Auxiliary Police were {{organised}} with {{at least}} one section per län. Each section consisted of two or more troops and each troop consisted of three eight-man squads.

25|$|One small study, which {{excluded}} {{individuals with}} a comorbid Axis 1 disorder, has indicated that outpatients undergoing Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and taking the antipsychotic Olanzapine show significantly more improvement on some measures related to BPD, compared to those undergoing DBT and taking a placebo pill, although they also experienced weight gain and raised cholesterol. Another small study found that patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> DBT and then took fluoxetine (Prozac) showed no significant improvements, whereas those who underwent DBT and then took a placebo pill did show significant improvements.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Rajah was {{appointed}} a Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Singapore. His {{time on the}} Bench was marked {{by a number of}} significant family law cases, including one in 1991 in which he held that since the gender of a transsexual person was to be determined according to biological criteria, sex reassignment surgery did not alter a person's gender. Thus, a marriage between an individual <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> a female-to-male sex change operation and a woman was void, being a marriage between two persons of the same gender. The decision prompted Parliament to amend the Women's Charter in 1996 to permit transsexual people to marry in the capacity of their new gender.|$|E
25|$|The age {{of opera}} seria corresponded {{with the rise}} to {{prominence}} of the castrati, often prodigiously gifted male singers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> castration before puberty in order to retain a high, powerful soprano or alto voice backed by decades of rigorous musical training. They were cast in heroic male roles, alongside another new breed of operatic creature, the prima donna. The rise of these star singers with formidable technical skills spurred composers to write increasingly complex vocal music, and many operas of the time were written as vehicles for specific singers. Of these the most famous is perhaps Farinelli, whose debut in 1722 was guided by Nicola Porpora. Though Farinelli did not sing for Handel, his main rival, Senesino, did.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, Roger Sperry {{developed}} split-brain preparations in non-human primates {{that emphasized}} the importance of information transfer that occurred in these neocortical connections. For example, learning on simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and motor output to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain has no idea what the left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with epilepsy <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer {{from one side of the}} brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for lateralization of function in the human brain.|$|E
25|$|June – Under {{the name}} , the first Affirmation group was {{organized}} on 11 June in Salt Lake City by Stephan Zakharias (formerly Stephen James Matthew Prince) {{and a group}} of other Mormon and former-Mormon gays and lesbians at the conference for the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights. Stephan organized the group in response to the suicides of two BYU friends <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> shock aversion therapy on the campus. The original organization struggled to survive until 1978, when Paul Mortensen, inspired by an article on the group in The Advocate formed the Los Angeles chapter, and in 1980 the name was changed to Affirmation: Gay & Lesbian Mormons. Through the influence of the Los Angeles chapter, Affirmation groups began appearing in many cities around the US.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court of South Korea {{has ruled}} {{that in order for}} a person to be {{eligible}} for a sex-change operation they must be over 20 years of age, single and without children. In the case of MTF (Male-to-Female) gender reassignment operations, the person must prove issues related to draft resolved by either serving or being exempted. On 22 June 2006, however the Supreme Court ruled that transgender individuals <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>undergone</b> successful sex reassignment surgery have the right to declare themselves in their new sex in all legal documents. This includes the right to request a correction of their gender-on-file in all public and government records such as the census registry. On March 2013, the Seoul Western District Court ruled that five female-to-male transgender individuals can be registed as male without sex reassignment surgery.|$|E
