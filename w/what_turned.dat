5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. <b>What</b> <b>turned</b> the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Fingleton made <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> {{out to be}} his {{international}} farewell as Australia toured England, {{a series}} in which he found runs difficult to come by. He later attributed this to his inability to play the pull shot. However, Fingleton started the tour well. He passed 30 {{in each of his}} first seven innings on English soil, and converted three of these starts into centuries, scoring 124 against Oxford University, 111 against Cambridge University and 123 not out against Hampshire in the first month of cricket. Fingleton's form tapered just at the wrong time, falling three times for single figures in the last two matches before the Tests. He carried this into the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he made only 9 and 40 in a high-scoring draw in which every innings passed 400.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 Thorkildsen {{finished}} fourth at European Championships in Helsinki only managing three throws {{with the best}} result of 81.55 metres after picking up an injury during warm-up. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London he threw 82.63 and finished sixth which became fifth several years later after disqualification of the original silver medalist Oleksandr Pyatnytsya for doping offence. Next year's World Championships at Moscow brought Thorkildsen a sixth place with a throw of 81.06 in <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> out to be his last appearance at a major championship competition. Injuries forced him to bring his 2014 season to a premature end before the European Championships. He later decided to sit out the entire 2015 season but aimed at comeback in 2016. However, in May 2016 Thorkildsen announced his retirement from sports.|$|E
5|$|In the January 2006 {{transfer}} window, {{he joined}} Grimsby Town on a two-year deal, {{three years after}} they first {{expressed an interest in}} signing him.

On 26 April 2006, Woodhouse said he planned to retire from football {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season and embark on a career as a professional boxer. He made 16 appearances in League Two, helping them to finish fourth place, reaching the play-offs. Woodhouse played in both of Grimsby's play-off semi-final victories over Lincoln City, setting up the only goal of the game in the first leg. He played his last Football League game in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium on 28 May 2006. Grimsby were defeated 1–0 in the final by Cheltenham Town. Woodhouse gave away a penalty in the 70th minute that was saved by goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall.|$|E

Bengaluru FC registered their third consecutive win in the group stage with 2–1 home win against Lao Toyota. A goal each from Eugeneson Lyngdoh and Kim Song-Yong in each half took Bengaluru FC to a win and with the win the team also advanced to round of 16 for the second year in running. In the final game of the group stage, Bengaluru FC faced the group leader Johor Darul Ta'zim, who maintained their perfect record against Bengaluru FC with 3–0 win and handed them their third consecutive defeat.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} the first meeting as {{opposing}} head coaches between Nick Saban and his former assistant coach from both LSU and the Miami Dolphins, Will Muschamp, the Crimson Tide defeated the Florida Gators, 38–10 at The Swamp. After receiving the opening kickoff, Florida scored their only touchdown of the game on their first offensive play from scrimmage. The Gators took an early 7–0 lead when John Brantley threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Andre Debose. Alabama responded on the following drive with Jeremy Shelley connecting on a 32-yard field goal to cut the Florida lead to 7–3. The Gators responded with <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> out to be their final points of the game when Caleb Sturgis connected on a 21-yard field goal. Alabama's Marquis Maze then returned the ensuing kickoff 70-yards to the Florida 29-yard line and the Crimson Tide tied the game at 10–10 seven plays later on a five-yard Trent Richardson touchdown run.|$|E
5|$|Scotland and Wales, {{having been}} drawn {{together}} in the same qualifying group for the 1986 World Cup, had been evenly matched throughout the competition, although Wales had secured a 1–0 win over Scotland in <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> out to be a controversial and bad-tempered game at Hampden Park in March 1985. This game, Wales' first win at Hampden for 34 years, saw Scottish complaints over {{what appeared to be a}} foul by Welsh striker Mark Hughes on defender Alex McLeish in the buildup to the goal scored by Ian Rush, and a clash between Scotland captain Graeme Souness and Welsh midfielder Peter Nicholas, for which both were booked, and which led to a number of the Welsh team surrounding the Scottish player. This booking would prove expensive as Souness was subsequently booked in Scotland's next qualifying game against Iceland, which led to him being suspended for the final qualifying game away to Wales.|$|E
5|$|Healey {{played at}} centre forward for The North in an amateur trial match in February 1910; his side lost 3–2, {{and he was}} not {{selected}} for the upcoming fixtures. His first international selection {{came in the form of}} a last-minute call-up when Frank Monk and Vivian Woodward dropped out of the England Amateur XI's visit to mainland Europe in March 1911. Healey made his debut against the French national team at the Stade de Paris, opening the scoring as his team won 3–0, and scored again a couple of days later against Switzerland in a 4–1 win. His next involvement at international level was nearly a year later, against the Wales Amateur XI at the ground of his former club, Bishop Auckland, in February 1912. He was involved in the buildup to the second goal, scored by Sydney Sanders, and scored the third himself as England won 3–0. He was selected as a reserve for matches at home to the Netherlands and away to Belgium in March and April, but did not make his next, and <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> out to be final, appearance until November against Belgium, in which he scored the second of England's four goals. He had to withdraw from the selection to face Wales in February 1913, and was an unused reserve for the visits to Germany and Belgium in March and to Wales the following February.|$|E
