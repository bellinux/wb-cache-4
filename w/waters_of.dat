5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated {{to draw the line}} of delimitation with respect to the territorial <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E

5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{is commonly}} found in <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> depths about 0–90 meters (0–295feet), being {{commonly found in}} sand and mudflats, but have also been encountered near rocky coral reefs, and sea grass beds.

It is found in northern Australia, Kenya, Madagascar, The island of Mauritius, Somalia, {{the east coast of}} South Africa, India. The bluespotted stingray is in almost the entire continental <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Asia, including the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Philippine Sea, Sulu Sea, Java Sea, Banda Sea, Celebes Sea, Andaman Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.|$|E

5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, and only then did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due to the warm <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.|$|E
