I wanted {{to show that you}} can have a child and you can work hard and you can get your body back. I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

6000|$|... 'A long way, Rube,' I said. 'That's agreed, then. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> the word, put {{the barrel}} against your eye and fire; that's a pretty safe shot.' ...|$|R

In an interview with HitQuarters, Rotem explained the song's conception, saying [...] "I heard 'Tainted Love' and {{wanted to take the}} bass line and update it with a new swing. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> the track to Evan , the 80s feeling was already in the track." [...] Rotem was asked how he felt about working with singers who became successful international recording artists after he had worked with them in an interview with William E. Ketchum for HipHopDX in May 2011, and referred to Rihanna and writing [...] "SOS" [...] in his response, saying: ...|$|E

She continued to study acting at the Yaletown Actors Studio for many years with her coach and husband, David Palffy.|$|E

6000|$|... "None {{too soon}} did Swanhild walk," [...] said Eric; [...] "now we shall learn their purpose. Be thou ready to leap forth <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> the word." ...|$|R

2500|$|His last public {{statement}} was dictated {{to his daughter}} Helen in reply to receiving the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford's [...] "sorrow and affection": [...] "There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more {{than that of the}} ancient University of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaining University of Oxford. I served her perhaps mistakenly, but {{to the best of my}} ability. [...] My most earnest prayers are hers to the uttermost and to the last". He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa. [...] The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> him the last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, crawl up. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> a whoop rush them. Take them alive. I {{wish to have}} a {{word with}} them first. Carry them into the hut. Go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Talleyrand and me hadn't met for a {{long time}} except at emigre parties. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> him the message he just shook his head. He was sorting buttons in the shop.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, you're to keep them, of course. That is what I meant <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> them. I {{have another}} pair of shoes and plenty of stockings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't commit suicide, and I'm {{as well as}} ever," [...] was {{the merry}} return. [...] "But--but--I don't believe you'll think I'm telling the truth <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> you my story." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps not, Sergeant, perhaps not; nor any better. This Jasper behaved well, too, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> him {{the command}} of the Scud; no lad could have {{conducted}} himself more loyally or better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tattycoram,' said he, 'for I'll {{call you}} {{by that name}} still, my good girl, {{conscious}} that I meant nothing but kindness <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> it to you, and conscious that you know it--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Garny, old horse," [...] he said, [...] "freeze {{onto the}} handle of the door, and, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> the word, fling wide the gates. Then watch that animal get the {{surprise}} of a lifetime." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Festing admitted. [...] "I didn't {{quite know}} what I'd {{undertaken}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> my promise. The thing looks worse in England. In fact, it looks very nearly impossible just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul Ruttledge. Well, sit down, anyway. The {{country people}} liked me well enough once, {{there was no}} man they liked so much as myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> them drink for nothing. Didn't they, Charlie? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For your {{behavior}} towards Mr. Mason I intend to lick {{the whole of}} the Upper School to-morrow <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> you your journey-money.

6000|$|... "Hear {{what he has}} to say. Then, as {{your horse}} is not wounded either, ride for it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> the signal as Masouda bade us. There is no other way. Pretend that you are wounded." ...|$|R
60|$|Colman. They {{understand}} me well enough <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> {{my mind to}} it. But {{it is harder to}} preach now {{than it was in the}} monastery. We had something to offer then; absolution here, and heaven after.|$|R
