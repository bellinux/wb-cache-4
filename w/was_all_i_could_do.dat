60|$|I {{stopped the}} night-work, but this <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for these neighbors.|$|E
60|$|Tho. Nay, I don't know, {{but in a}} fright it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|I nodded my head again. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to {{keep myself}} {{standing}} upright.|$|E
60|$|PARAMORE (utterly {{contemptuous of}} Craven's narrow {{personal}} {{view of the}} matter). Yes. That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get a license for.|$|R
60|$|Those wild words <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{say before}} the misery and madness in me forced their way outward {{in a burst}} of sobs and tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon you can coax {{it out of}} Roy. Fact <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn <b>was</b> thet Roy come in {{the saloon}} alone. Beasley was there, an' Riggs--" ...|$|R
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from crying.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep a}} {{straight}} face. I'd {{a pretty good idea}} where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|E
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|E
60|$|It wrung {{my heart}} to see her; it wrung {{my heart to}} hear her. I {{answered}} by a sign--it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do--that <b>I</b> submitted myself to her will.|$|R
60|$|It {{was strange}} {{to be reduced}} to such {{indirect}} evidence on such a point as that; but it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get, and <b>I</b> had to be content with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you are ill, Cristel?" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find to say, under the double {{disadvantage}} of speaking through a door, {{and having a}} father listening at my side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Every day I gazed on {{the lovely}} fruit, which became {{gradually}} {{more and more}} tempting-looking, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> not to break the magician's commands.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{that last}} {{manoeuvre}} of yours," [...] he said, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to prevent him}} from rushing over to Jerry Shorter's--and signing the lease." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep awake, but I {{managed to}} do so {{with the aid of}} an early morning paper I bought on the train.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Nonsense, old chap!' {{said the}} other, {{slapping}} him upon the shoulder. 'I've had a nasty facer myself, but--' That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear, {{but it was}} enough to set me thinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> squeeze out," [...] said he; [...] "and {{from what}} I {{know of the}} matter you design to meddle in, I can only pray God that it may prove sufficient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! by Jingo!" [...] he ejaculated, [...] "oh! by Jingo!" [...] {{and that}} <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get out of}} him, though it is true I did not try very hard at the time.|$|R
6000|$|Putney laughed. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep Ellen {{from getting}} up and going out of church too, when Brother Gerrish set the example. She's a Gerrishite at heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My sweetheart, when I saw {{you doing}} that Dream of What's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from rushing out on {{to the floor and}} hugging you.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} from him with a little shudder, {{and for the first time}} during the {{interview}} she hid her face in her hands. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to avoid speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly, sir; {{my purpose}} is known and {{approved}} by more than one," [...] said I. [...] "And your letter, which I take a pleasure to thank you for, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have hoped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tippecanoe? Not exactly that. I wasn't {{acquainted with}} any {{one in the}} office, but they had printed somethings of mine, and {{they were willing to}} let me try my hand. That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|With a {{sense of}} {{impending}} tragedy I took {{her in my arms}} and led her to a chair. [...] "Don't worry, mother!" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say. [...] "It will pass soon. Keep perfectly quiet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was in {{the bushes}} by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn't let you know before at the pace you were going. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His landlady {{was going}} to do that," [...] Aaron continued. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to sit in the cab by his side. I wish--yes, I almost wish that he'd never got up from that carpet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? I held my tongue! It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do!</b> I {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, and then all I could do was still to keep silence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear, you <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ask," [...] and Mrs. Shaw {{looked up}} at him with such affection and {{confidence}} in her eyes, that Polly gave Tom the first approving look she had vouchsafed him since she came.|$|R
6000|$|... "These <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hire to-day, sir," [...] the man said. [...] "They are {{too much}} frightened {{to come out}} of their houses. To-morrow we shall get plenty of men. The consul told me to go with you as interpreter." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carloman {{crept up}} to them--"Here I am at last!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Here, Richard, I have brought you some bread, as {{you had no}} dinner: it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring. <b>I</b> saved it under the table lest Lothaire should see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aw, I served my {{apprenticeship}} in the jacket," [...] Al Hutchins sneered. [...] "And I've made you unlace me, Captain, {{when you thought}} I was croaking, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from snickering in your face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't so easy, {{by a long}} chalk! The {{rain had}} made the boughs mighty slippery, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was level with the window.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Stringham {{dealt with}} these questions. [...] "I showed him I {{understood}} him. That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> I didn't feel {{at liberty to}} be explicit; but I felt, even though his visit so upset me, the comfort of what I had from you night before last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{brought you}} {{something}} to eat, Granny," [...] he panted, as he laid the fish at her feet. He was quite out of breath with running. [...] "It isn't much, but it is something. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did so {{want to do}} {{something}} for you. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do--that little money. And then you were angry. I thought you didn't love me any more because I did not understand your work.... And that Miss Heydinger--Oh! it was hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling!" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say, as <b>I</b> {{drew her}} again {{closer to me}} and kissed her. After a bit she was calmer; seeing this, I {{came back to the}} subject that she had--in part, at all events--come to me to speak about: ...|$|R
