25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's <b>watched</b> <b>me</b> and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|Accompanying Duff's {{new musical}} style, the record label began {{promoting}} {{her with a}} more mature image. Duff dyed her hair dark and [...] "sexed-up" [...] her image. According to Duff, she wanted to [...] "try new things", but the image change [...] "just happened. It is not like a conscious change. People think it is so different because they have <b>watched</b> <b>me</b> grow up but that is just what happens in life." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Duff's new look as comprising [...] "dark mane, dental veneers, luxe and vampy fashions". In mid-2007, concurrent to {{the preparation of the}} radio release of [...] "Stranger", Duff was featured on the July covers of the magazines Us Weekly and Shape in a bikini, and on the August cover of Maxim accompanied by the declaration that she had gone [...] "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol". The Associated Press wrote that Duff's more provocative image would help her singles to garner mainstream radio play. Guy Zapoleon, a radio consultant and former programmer for Top 40 radio, explained that [...] "radio has a stigma about playing [...] acts, considering them teen and preteen in their appeal", and that Duff's provocative image would [...] "definitely {{have a positive effect on}} the attitude of programmers, who are mostly male, as Disney tries to mature her image". A bonus EP containing five bonus remixes was released exclusively to US WalMart stores as a package with the album.|$|E

2500|$|He {{had played}} only six {{first-class}} games {{when he got}} picked for the Pakistan camp out of the blue. Waqar says [...] "I remember Imran was not feeling well at the time, and was not present at the camp. Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, {{and there was a}} match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran <b>watched</b> <b>me</b> on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and told me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection was just out of this world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I wish I could say that I {{did a lot of}} traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was sit on the couch and get high—while the TV <b>watched</b> <b>me.</b> It was a very, very hard time." ...|$|E
