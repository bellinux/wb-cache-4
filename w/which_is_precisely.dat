Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the head as part of other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox {{to ask about the}} gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could not come up with a documentary history of how the head came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's head was “the only instance of a head cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> the case with respect to {{the head in}} question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that the head was a fake were prevalent.|$|E

500|$|In the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist {{criticism}} dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said {{devoted a}} chapter of his book Culture and Imperialism (1993) to Mansfield Park, arguing that the peripheral position of [...] "Antigua" [...] {{and the issue of}} slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether Mansfield Park justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about Mansfield Park and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about Mansfield Park reflecting the [...] "spatial" [...] understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay [...] "'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' Mansfield Parks Colonial Unconscious" [...] argued that the [...] "barbarism" [...] of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the [...] "barbarism" [...] of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the [...] "barbarism" [...] and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their [...] "place", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper [...] "place". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to Mansfield Park, writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Emil Gayk" [...] sketch was {{the only}} one <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> dated to the early stages of World War I, {{focusing}} its satire on the debates of neutralists and interventionists. Gayk, the ever-vigilant, gun-tauting, bird-like civilian, who sleeps in his tailcoat but otherwise wears only a festooned drape, swims about in just one direction ("for fear of coming out of his neutrality") and gets inspired by the military muses. His career is in foreign relations, which he revolutionizes with such novel ideas as the negotiated annexation of a unidimensional, arrow-like, territory at Năsăud—pointed toward Luxembourg, in memory of the 1914 invasion. Gayk has an adoptive daughter, educated on his behalf by waiters, who makes her home in the fields and eventually demands access to the sea. Angered by this claim, Gayk begins a large-scale war against her; the conflict ends in a stalemate, as Gayk can no longer accessorize his marshal's uniform, and the girl has lost her supplies of gasoline and beans. The father is placated with regular gifts of feed grain, whereas the daughter is allowed a two-centimeter-wide littoral.|$|E
2500|$|The pederastic {{relationships}} {{common to}} ancient Greek life {{are also at}} the fore of this dialogue. [...] In addition to theme of love discussed in the speeches, seeming double entendres and sexual innuendo is abundant; we see the flirtation between Phaedrus and Socrates as Phaedrus encourages Socrates to make his first speech, Phaedrus makes a remark at noon-time that Socrates should not leave as the heat has not passed and it is [...] "straight-up, as they say," [...] Socrates wishes to know what Phaedrus is holding under his cloak, and so on. [...] The relationships discussed in the speeches are explicitly pederastic. [...] And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, {{as they are in}} the Symposium. [...] Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as [...] "friends"–equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty. [...] In the beginning, they sit themselves under a chaste tree, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> what its name suggests—often known as [...] "monk's pepper", it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an antaphrodisiac. [...] Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.|$|E

[...] On the general topic of U.S. News methodology, she states, [...] "what many of us dispute is the validity of a single score computed by using [...] "data points" [...] to which weights are arbitrarily ascribed (why should retention count for 20% instead of 30%; why is peer assessment 25% instead of 10%; and who decides?). How can a single measure be valid when, in some cases, values are made up {{when they are not}} provided (the case of the missing SATs at Sarah Lawrence — the point of my Washington Post Op-Ed)? However, that's exactly what U.S. News does each year. Professional statisticians have reported that the methodology used by the magazine is seriously flawed and cannot be trusted." [...] She also responds to Skube's discussion of Sarah Lawrence's decision not to consider SAT or ACT scores by stating, [...] "Skube says he knows 'all he needs to know about Sarah Lawrence' because the college does not use SAT scores in its admission process, and therefore he infers we don't take aptitude seriously. Perhaps he doesn't know the research showing that SAT tests do not measure aptitude and at best provide a guess about academic performance {{in the first year of}} college.
