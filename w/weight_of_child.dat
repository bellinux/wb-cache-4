Methods: A longitudinal study of one-year duration, from June 2010 to May 2011, was conducted in an urban slum of Mumbai, India. Universal sampling method was employed, including as subjects all pregnant women with minimum two Antenatal Care (ANC) visits - {{and at least one}} in the third trimester - registered at an urban health centre from June to August 2010. Subjects with any pre-existing co-morbid illness or with past history of giving birth to twins or to any congenitally malformed child, or else, with outcome of still births or home delivery, were excluded. These women were followed up for the next months until delivery. Maternal weight was recorded at each visit and BMI was calculated, or the average BMI, in case of more than one visit in any trimester. Birth weight was recorded using hospital or maternity home records. Results: Prevalence of low birth weight was 26. 7 %. Correlation between maternal BMI of third trimester and neonatal birth weight was moderately positive. 60. 8 % of variability in birth weight can be predicted by maternal BMI in third trimester. Conclusions: Third trimester BMI {{can be used as a}} predictor of neonatal birth weight.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of factors {{associated}} with child mortality in Uganda. The Demographic and Health Survey data set (2006) is used to investigate these factors. A random effects regression model and logistic regression model were fitted to establish the significant factors affecting child mortality. The paper considers two types of factors which are maternal Factors (Education level, age of mother, wealth of household) and child factors (birth order, <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>child,</b> Sex of a child, and duration of breastfeeding). Sex, birth weight, Education level, age of mother and household wealth were found to be important predictors of child mortality. However, controlling for mother level factors in model II, the within childhood characteristics were highly correlated. From an explicit multilevel analytic framework, the study therefore demonstrates that individual (child) and mother level characteristics are independent predictors of child mortality; and that there is significant variation in odds of reporting child mortality, even after controlling for effects of both child and mother-level characteristics. The p- values in the random effects model were small compared to the p – values of a standard logistic model. The results of random effects model are more statistically significant than those of a standard logistic regression model. Therefore, the random effects regression model is recommended as an appropriate alternative to standard logistic regression in order to account for variations due to a hierarchical structure...|$|E

There were 2192 singleton deliveries with respect to sex of child, birth <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> and mode of delivery, out of which 386 (17. 61 %) were caesarean sections. The incidence of normal weight of children born in south-east Nigeria weighing between 2. 5 kg and 4. 0 kg is 86. 18 %, while low birth weight which is below 2. 5 kg, is 5. 75 %. Low birth weight is higher in females (57. 94 %) as compared to males (42. 06 %). Mean birth weight is however higher in males than in females (3. 46 ± 0. 60 and 3. 27 ± 0. 61 respectively). Incidence of caesarean deliveries is greater in babies weighing 4. 1 kg and above (36. 16 %) than in low birth weight babies (16. 67 %).

40|$|Abstract Background In {{paediatric}} emergency medicine, estimation <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> in ill <b>children</b> can {{be performed}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Calculation using the ‘APLS’ formula (weight[*]=[*][age[*]+[*] 4] × 2) is one very common method. Studies on its validity in developed countries suggest that it tends to under-estimate the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> potentially leading to errors in drug and fluid administration. The formula is not validated in Trinidad and Tobago, where it is routinely used to calculate weight in paediatric resuscitation. Methods Over a six-week period in January 2009, all children one to five years old presenting to the Emergency Department were weighed. Their measured weights were compared to their estimated weights as calculated using the APLS formula, the Luscombe and Owens formula and a “best fit” formula derived (then simplified) from linear regression analysis <b>of</b> the measured <b>weights.</b> Results The APLS formula underestimated weight in all age groups with a mean difference of − 1. 4 [*]kg (95 % limits of agreement 5. 0 to − 7. 8). The Luscombe and Owens formula was more accurate in predicting weight than the APLS formula, with a mean difference of − 0. 4 [*]kg (95 % limits of agreement 6. 9 to − 6. 1 %). Using linear regression analysis, and simplifying the derived equation, the best formula to describe weight and age was (weight[*]=[*][2. 5 x age][*]+[*] 8). The percentage <b>of</b> <b>children</b> whose actual <b>weight</b> fell within 10 % <b>of</b> the calculated <b>weights</b> using any <b>of</b> the three formulae was not significantly different. Conclusions The APLS formula slightly underestimates the <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in Trinidad, although this is less than in similar studies in developed countries. Both the Luscombe and Owens formula and the formula derived from {{the results of this study}} give a better estimate <b>of</b> the measured <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in Trinidad. However, the accuracy and precision of all three formulae were not significantly different from each other. It is recommended that the APLS formula should continue to be used to estimate the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in resuscitation situations in Trinidad, as it is well known, easy to calculate and widely taught in this setting. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Many studies {{confirm the}} {{hypotheses}} that a {{low birth weight}} {{is associated with the}} emergence of ailments at a later age. There is convincing evidence that symptoms of stress, fear and depression during pregnancy influence the birth weight. In contradiction to fear and depression during pregnancy, little research has been done of the role that a personality of a pregnant woman has on the birth results <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> Hypotheses: Certain personality traits, coupled with chronic stress, lead to a lower birth weight and Apgar scores of the after-birth. This association is partially mediated by symptoms of fear and depression during pregnancy. Aim: To research what the relation is between personality traits of pregnant women and birth results <b>of</b> the <b>child</b> and to what extent an effect of personality {{can be explained by the}} familiar effect of fear and depression to birth results. Methods: This prospective observational cohort research was done within the P 5 D -study (Prediction of anxiety and Depression during Pregnancy and the Postnatal Period; the role of Personality). In this research participants were followed from the inclusion in the first term until six months. At several measurement moments data was collected: baseline (before the 15 th week of pregnancy), 24 th week of pregnancy, 36 th week of pregnancy and during child birth (birth records). Symptoms of fear and depression were determined with the questionnaires ‘State Trait Anxiety Inventory’ (STAI) and the ‘Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale’ (EPDS). Personality traits were determined with the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Before the birth weight and the Apgar-scores the participant’s birth records were requested. Results: 1863 women were included in this study. Experiencing symptoms of fear and depression during pregnancy were associated with the birth <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> This meant: the more symptoms of fear and depression were experienced, the lower the birth <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> There appeared to be no association between personality traits, birth weight and the Apgar-scores <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> Conclusion: There was no association between the personality traits of the pregnant woman and the birth <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> Furthermore it appeared that personality traits did not influence the Apgar-scores <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> However there did seem to be an association between the number of symptoms of fear and depression during pregnancy and the birth <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> This meant: the more symptoms of fear and depression were experienced, the lower the birth <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child.</b> ...|$|R
