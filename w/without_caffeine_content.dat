40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{communication}} {{describes a}} simple and modified colorimetric procedure for the estimation of <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in both commercial and locally available tea samples. Comparative data of <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in different brands of tea samples are shown here. The present method is no doubt an improvised procedure for estimating directly <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> from the tea extracts. A possible explanation {{to account for the}} variability in <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in different samples is offered...|$|R
50|$|A {{container}} of 100 gram has a <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of about 200 mg. Since each container contains 16 individual embossed portions, each portion has a <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of about 12.5 mg caffeine.|$|R
40|$|Tea {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{beverages}} having a great beneficial effect on human health. This is because of the tea contains a lot of worthy compounds consist of polyphenol, theophiline, flavoniod/methylxanthine, tannin, vitamin C and E, catechin, and some mineral such as Zn, Se, Mo, Ge, Mg. However, tea also contains an undesirable compound called caffeine. This compound can cause some undesirable reactions such as insomnia, nervous, delirium, tachycardia, extra systole, respiratory increase, tremor, and dieresis. In order to reduce negative effect of caffeine, general method have been applied for reducing <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> by using solvent extraction and supercritical extraction with CO 2. This research was focused on production of low <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> tea using extraction with ethyl acetate as solvent. Specifically, this research was conducted in order to study the effect of temperature and time on reduction of <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> to obtain optimum condition of production of low <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> tea, to carried out organoleptic test to check the flavor of low <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> tea, and to make a mathematical modeling for extraction of caffeine from tea. Experimental works were executed in 10 runs with operation time (63, 4 – 176, 6 minutes) and temperature (45, 8 - 74, 1 °C) as the independent variable. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content.</b> The data resulted was processed using Response Surface Methodology to obtain mathematical model and optimum operating condition. The experiment resulted tea with <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> reduction of 10, 4 - 40, 1 % (2, 8 – 10, 9 mg/g tea). The product is tea with <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of 1, 63 – 2, 44 %. The optimum operating condition obtained from RSM are temperature 58, 5 °C, time 98, 5 minutes, and <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> reduction 40, 3 %. Organoleptic test show that the extraction process doesn’t have effect on the tea flavor...|$|R
50|$|Afri-Cola, a German brand, had {{a higher}} <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> (about 250 mg/L) until the product was relaunched with a new {{formulation}} in 1999. It was relaunched a second time in April 2006 with the original formulation with the higher <b>caffeine</b> <b>content.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in {{test sample}} is {{determined}} by various analytical methods and its level is reported based on the proficiency of the method adopted. The international organization for standardization (ISO) has recommended two methods for the determination of <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in coffee samples. The ISO 4052 determines <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> through UV spectrophotometry and ISO 20481 estimates <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the present study, <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in twenty two coffee samples was determined following both the ISO methods to assess the overall proficiency of these two methods. The {{results indicated that the}} caffeine level obtained by the ISO 20481 (HPLC method) was comparatively higher than those obtained by the ISO 4052 (UV spectrophotometry) in all the twenty two coffee samples. The overall deviation of caffeine level obtained by ISO 20481 (HPLC method) over the ISO 4052 (UV spectrophotometry) ranged from 0. 07 to 0. 71 % on dry matter basis. However, statistical analysis of data (t-Test) indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} between the methods. Nonetheless, ISO 20481 (HPLC method) is seems to be simple, rapid and realistic in estimating <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in coffee samples...|$|R
5000|$|Espresso {{has more}} {{caffeine}} per unit volume than most coffee beverages, {{but because the}} usual serving size is much smaller, the total <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> {{is less than a}} mug of standard brewed coffee, contrary to a common belief. Although the actual <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of any coffee drink varies by size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of [...] "typical" [...] servings of espresso vs. drip brew are 120 to 170 mg vs. 150 to 200 mg.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the <b>caffeine</b> <b>contents</b> in five certain Vietnamese coffee (Dak Tin, Di Linh, Nam Nguyen, Origin and Vinacafe) {{found in}} the Vietnamese market were {{determined}} using UV/vis spectrophotometry. The quantification of caffeine sample was calculated by standard addition method. Our {{results showed that the}} <b>caffeine</b> <b>contents</b> in coffee brewing were influenced by temperature of water used to brew, time of brewing, and independent on the volume of water, respectively. In general, higher concentrations of caffeine were found in all samples prepared at temperature 100 °C for 5 minutes. The order of <b>caffeine</b> <b>contents</b> in coffee samples was Dak Tin, Di Linh, Nam Nguyen, Origin and Vinacafe, respectively. This study can contribute to a better knowledge of <b>caffeine</b> <b>contents</b> in Vietnamese coffee of Vietnamese consumers...|$|R
40|$|Caffeine {{inheritance}} {{was investigated}} in F 2 and BC 1 F 1 generations between Coffea arabica var. Bourbon Vermelho (BV) and Coffea canephora var. Robusta 4 x (R 4 x). The <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of seeds and leaves was determined during 2004 and 2005. Microsatellite loci-markers were used to deduce the meiotic pattern of chromosome pairing of tetraploid interspecific hybrids. Genetic analysis indicated that <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in seeds was quantitatively inherited and controlled by genes with additive effects. The estimates of broad-sense heritability of <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in seeds were high for both generations. In coffee leaves, the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> (BSH) from the same populations showed transgressive segregants with enhanced levels and high BSH. Segregation of loci-markers in BC 1 F 1 populations showed that the ratios of the gametes genotype {{did not differ significantly}} from those expected assuming random associations and tetrasomic inheritance. The results confirm the existence of distinct mechanisms controlling the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in seeds and leaves, the gene exchange between the C. arabica BV and C. canephora R 4 x genomes and favorable conditions for improving <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in this coffee population.

50|$|The <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> {{of instant}} coffee is {{generally}} {{less than that}} of brewed coffee. One study comparing various home-prepared samples came to the result that regular instant coffee (not decaffeinated) has a median <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of 66 mg per cup (range 29-117 mg per cup), with a median cup size of 225 ml (range 170-285 ml) and a caffeine concentration of 328 µg/ml (range 102-559 µg/ml). In comparison, drip or filter coffee was estimated to have a median <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of 112 mg, with a median concentration of 621 µg/ml for the same cup size.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{study was to examine the}} {{knowledge}} of <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of a variety of caffeinated beverages among Dutch university students. A pencil-and-paper survey was conducted among N = 800 Dutch students. Most participants (87. 8 %) reported consuming caffeinated beverages during the past 24 h. Their mean &# 0177; SD past 24 -h caffeine intake from beverages was 144. 2 &# 0177; 169. 5 mg (2. 2 &# 0177; 3. 0 mg/kg bw). Most prevalent sources of caffeine were coffee beverages (50. 8 %) and tea (34. 8 %), followed by energy drink (9. 2 %), cola (4. 7 %), and chocolate milk (0. 5 %). Participants had poor knowledge on the relative <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of caffeinated beverages. That is, they overestimated the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of energy drinks and cola, and underestimated the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of coffee beverages. If caffeine consumption is a concern, it is important to inform consumers about the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of all <b>caffeine</b> containing beverages, including coffee and tea. The current findings support previous research that the most effective way to reduce caffeine intake is to limit the consumption of coffee beverages and tea...|$|R

25|$|Caffeine {{constitutes}} about 3% of tea's dry weight, translating {{to between}} 30mg and 90mg per 8-oz (250-ml) cup depending on type, brand, and brewing method. A {{study found that}} the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of 1g of black tea ranged from 22 to 28mg, while the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of 1g of green tea ranged from 11 to 20mg, reflecting a significant difference.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper was to identify the number of major loci explaining <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in coffee seeds. Investigations were based on previously published results: (1) Caffeine binds to chlorogenic acids in a 1 : 1 molecular ratio; (2) Between species, the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> is correlated to the chlorogenic acid content; (3) Only a part of chlorogenic acids is bound to <b>caffeine.</b> Especially, the <b>content</b> ratio between <b>caffeine</b> and chlorogenic acids varied between species. For identifying the number of major loci, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach was carried out using an interspecific cross between two highly differentiated species-Coffea liberica dewevrei and Coffea pseudozanguebariae, the latter being a caffeine-free species. As main finding, two QTLs, i. e., RCQ 1 and CQA 1, were identified allowing us to explain up to 97 % of the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> variance. RCQ 1 explained variation of the caffeine/chlorogenic acid ratio and was genetically independent of the second QTL. The latter explained {{the part of the}} <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> which was dependent on the chlorogenic acid content. The findings also confirmed that only a part of chlorogenic acids were trapped by caffeine, as in wild species...|$|R
50|$|However, the new recipe was unpopular (as with New Coke). The mixture {{was again}} changed to taste {{more like the}} {{original}} one, the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> was increased in 2005 to around 200 mg/L and caffeine was again listed as an ingredient on the label. This mixture was also not sufficiently successful and on April 1, 2006, the company finally changed {{back to the original}} recipe, with <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of 250 mg/L.|$|R
40|$|The <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of 10 energy drinks, 19 carbonated sodas, and 7 other {{beverages}} was determined. In addition, {{the variability}} of the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of Coca-Cola | fountain soda was evaluated. Caffeine was isolated from the samples by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. The caffeine concentration of the caffeinated energy drinks ranged from none detected to 141. 1 rag/serving. The <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of the carbonated sodas ranged from none detected to 48. 2 rag/serving, {{and the content of}} the other beverages ranged from < 2. 7 to 105. 7 mg/serving. The intra-assay mean, standard deviation, and % coefficient of variation for the Coca-Cola fountain samples were 44. 5, 2. 95, and 6. 64 rag/serving, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid {{colorimetric}} method for {{the determination of}} caffeine has been developed. Tea tree lines from the Hadong region in South Korea differ widely in their <b>caffeine</b> <b>contents</b> and this colorimetric method facilitated an efficient screening strategy for the selection of low-caffeine-containing lines. A high correlation was observed between the values obtained with colorimetric and high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis. Among the selected tree lines, the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> for the lowest caffeine-containing tea tree line (H- 19) was 178. 35 Î¼g/g dry weight basis, which was 61 -fold less productive than the highest caffeine-producing tea tree line (H- 82). <b>Caffeine</b> <b>contents</b> of the selected tea tree lines remained similar during the corresponding collection periods. The colorimetric method is of great practical value in screening low-caffeine-containing tea trees. Â© 2007 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of beverages {{prepared at home}} by staff of the Addiction Research Foundation revealed a lower and much more variable <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of both tea and coffee than had been reported in earlier studies, {{most of which were}} based on {{analysis of}} laboratory-prepared beverages. Median caffeine concentration of 37 home-prepared samples of tea was 27 mg per cup (range, 8 to 91 mg); for 46 coffee samples the median concentration was 74 mg per cup (range, 29 to 176 mg). If tea and coffee as drunk contain less caffeine than generally supposed, the potency of caffeine may be greater than commonly realized, as may the relative <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of certain commercial preparations, including chocolate and colas. The substantial variation in <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> emphasizes the need to establish actual caffeine intake in clinical, epidemiologic and experimental investigations of caffeine effects...|$|R
40|$|Determinou-se a porcentagem de óleo e de cafeína em sementes de diversas variedades de Coffee arabica. As sementes provieram de frutos despolpados, secos em terreiro sem despolpar, ou secos na própria planta. O tratamento des frutos influiu sôbre o teor de óleo, sendo também significativa a diferença entre as variedades. Os dados confirmam resultados anteriores de que a variedade mucronata é rica e a, variedade laurina, pobre, em óleo. No que {{concerne}} ao teor de cafeína, o tratamento dos frutos não mostrou influência, mas pronunciada diferença se constatou entre as variedades. Sete das variedades se mostraram mais pobres do que o café 'Sumatra', tomado comg padrão. A variedade laurina destacou-se das demais pelo baixo teor dêsse alcalóide com, aproximadamente, a metade do nível encontrado nas demais variedades analisadas, o que a torna valiosa para um piano de melhoramento visando a redução do nível de cafeína nas sementes. Oil and <b>caffeine</b> <b>contents</b> {{were determined}} for seed samples obtained from cherries of sixteen varieties of Coffea arabica which were submitted to {{three types of}} treatments pulped, non pulped and left to dry with pericarp in the sun, or naturally dried on the tree. Cherry processing {{seems not to have}} influence on the oil content in the seeds (table I), but significant differences were noted among the varieties with respect to this characteristic. Mucronata revealed to have high oil content while the laurina is a low oil producing variety. Coffee cherries left to dry on the trees gave lower <b>caffeine</b> <b>content.</b> Seven of the sixteen varieties presented a lower <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> than the standard 'Sumatra'. The laurinis variety had an exceptional lower <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> of about half the amount found in the control. Laurina characteristics are controlled by a recessive allele lr with strong pleiotropic effects. It is not yet known how the laurina allele affects the chemical reactions which lead to a so low <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in the coffee bean. The value of the lr allele was stressed in reducing the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in the coffee selected cultivars...|$|R

40|$|Coffee arabica L. {{is highly}} homozygotic and <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> in most cultivars is {{reported}} to be similar (approximately 1 %). The <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> was analysed using individual seeds of cultivars Catuai Vermelho, Mundo Novo and Bourbon Vermelho, and varieties Mokka and Laurina of C. arabica. Seeds were cut transversely in half, a thin slice from each was extracted in a mixture of chloroform and methanol, and caffeine was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The extraction procedure was validated by comparison with two conventional methods less suited for analysing large numbers of seeds. The results revealed an unexpectedly large variation [Catuai Vermelho: 3. 72 - 25. 9 mg g(- 1) (seeds) Mundo Novo: 5. 06 - 18. 59 mg g(- 1); Bourbon Vermelho: 6. 76 - 16. 59 mg g(- 1) ] even in types naturally low in caffeine such as Laurina (1. 17 - 9. 97 mg g(- 1)) and Mokka (2. 01 - 9. 64 mg g(- 1)). The mean values for all cultivars were always in the range of the <b>caffeine</b> <b>content</b> found in the literature.
