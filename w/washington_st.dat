25|$|The {{final design}} was {{released}} in 1974, when SR 143 was known as Business I-10 and not yet a freeway, but a parkway with traffic signals and intersections. The design portrayed the new parkway leaving Interstate 10 north along 48th Street corridor, then angling across the Salt River to reach 44th Street where it was planned to end at <b>Washington</b> <b>St.</b> When it opened in 1978, it included the vital eastern access to Sky Harbor Airport, replacing the old 40th Street entrance that was eliminated when 40th Street was demolished {{to make way for}} a new airport terminal and runway expansions.|$|E
25|$|The family worshiped at Saint Mary's Basilica {{was built}} in 1914. The {{segregated}} and discriminatory practices of the time were not only limited to the city. The Catholic Church in Phoenix also discriminated against Hispanics.

They were sent to the church’s basement while a separate ceremony was held above them for the children of Caucasians. After experiencing discrimination there, Soledad and other Mexican women began selling enchiladas, tamales and other food to raise money to build a new Catholic church. The construction of the, which was named Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, was finished in 1928 and is located at 909 E. <b>Washington</b> <b>St..</b>|$|E

25|$|The Phoenix Block is a {{collection}} of buildings at 106–108 West <b>Washington</b> <b>St.</b> Today, only two of the original four buildings that made up the Phoenix Block remain. The Phoenix Block was so dubbed by the Daily Pantagraph as a remark on how quickly the buildings rose from the ashes after a fire in 1855. Originally, the buildings' upper floor served as offices for lawyers who tried cases in the original wood frame courthouse. The Kersey H. Fell Building of 1856 is one of downtown Bloomington's oldest structures. The Fell Building housed the office of local attorney Kersey Fell. His second floor office is the place where it is claimed that Jesse Fell first suggested to Abraham Lincoln he should run for president. Aside from the law offices the third floor once housed the Illinois Natural History Museum, in 1857, {{which was one of the}} first museums in Illinois. The storefronts have been home to numerous merchants over the years. From 1905 to 1922 Homuth Jewelry had a location along the block and Sorg's Jewelers had a location on the Phoenix Block from 1946 until 1988. In addition five other jewelers have had businesses along this block at some point in its past.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, Kaiser Shipbuilding Company {{began making}} ships {{for the war}} at three huge {{installations}} near the lower slough, one in St. Johns, one on Swan Island in Portland's Overlook neighborhood, and one in Vancouver, <b>Washington.</b> <b>St.</b> Johns and Vancouver made Liberty ships, while Swan Island made tankers. The St. Johns shipyard became the nation's leading producer of Liberty ships. To house shipyard workers and their families, Henry J. Kaiser bought [...] of former marsh, pasture, and farmland in the lower slough watershed surrounded on all sides by dikes between [...] high. Here he built a new city, at first called Kaiserville and later Vanport. By 1943, Vanport's population of 39,000 made it the second largest city in Oregon and the largest wartime housing project in the U.S. After the war, the population fell to about 18,500. This was roughly {{the number of people}} living there on May 30, 1948, when a flood broke through Vanport's western levee. The break occurred during the afternoon of a day with mild weather. The first rush of water soon became a [...] "creeping inundation", slowed in its advance for 35 to 40minutes by water-absorbing sloughs. The water's gradual rise within the city allowed most of the residents to escape drowning. The county coroner's official list of bodies recovered was set at fifteen, and seven people on a list of missing people were never found. The flood destroyed the city, which was never rebuilt.|$|E
