5|$|In {{the classic}} {{analysis}} by Edward Lorenz (the Lorenz Energy Cycle), extratropical cyclones (so-called atmospheric transients) {{acts as a}} mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy. In the process, the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced (i.e. energy is transported poleward to <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> the higher latitudes).|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|Buffon {{became the}} first choice goalkeeper during the Euro 2000 {{qualifying}} campaign and was due to start in goal during the finals under manager and former Italy goalkeeping legend Dino Zoff, but he broke his hand in a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> match against Norway {{just a few days}} before Italy's opening match against Turkey. His starting place was taken by backup goalkeeper Francesco Toldo, and Christian Abbiati was called up as a replacement third keeper, with Francesco Antonioli being promoted to second goalkeeper. Italy reached the final of the tournament, losing once again to France.|$|E

50|$|Weight {{trainers}} commonly spend 5 to 20 minutes <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> {{their muscles}} before starting a workout. It {{is common to}} stretch the entire body to increase overall flexibility; however, many people stretch just the area being worked that day. The main reason for <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> is injury prevention. <b>Warming</b> <b>up</b> increases blood flow and flexibility, which lessens {{the chance of a}} muscle pull or joint pain.|$|R

5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|From summer 2005, {{the media}} had linked Cissé with a move away from Anfield. Speculation {{intensified}} as the season went on. In early June 2006, {{it was reported that}} a transfer to Olympique de Marseille had been agreed. The very same day Cissé broke his leg during France's final <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> match against China on 7 June 2006. It was thought that even though a relatively quick recovery was expected, Cissé's transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{had entered}} into {{the main part of}} its {{schedule}} after three dominating wins. Upcoming engagements with Vanderbilt, Pittsburgh, and Centre were said to determine the season's outcome. Pittsburgh and Centre–but Pittsburgh especially, were the biggest opponents. Vanderbilt was seen as the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> act to these two, for it was far superior to any of Tech's prior games. The first game of the year to have direct implications for the Southern championship, it was cited by some as the most interesting southern contest of the week.|$|E
50|$|For example, before {{running or}} playing an {{intensive}} sport, the athlete might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It {{is important that}} <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The {{risks and benefits of}} combining stretching with <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> are dispute, although it is generally believed that <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> prepares the athlete both mentally and physically. In a meta-study of 32 high quality studies, about 4/5 ths of the studies showed improvements in performance.|$|R

This was a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> to their largest concert so far, held at Margam Country Park near Port Talbot. Guitarist Powell stated {{the importance of the}} Llangollen performances, as North Wales was the first place where the crowd had sung along to their songs. Matthews added that Margam Park was chosen as no-one had ever held a concert there before.|$|E
5|$|Karthik was {{recalled}} to the Indian ODI {{team for}} the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy following a great domestic season and IPL performance. He scored back to back centuries in the two <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> games sealing {{his place in the}} {{team for the}} tournament. Unfortunately these centuries will not be counted in his first class statistics as the teams were playing a 15- side team. He scored an unbeaten 51 in India's group match against the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|After a few <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E

5|$|At the Portuguese Grand Prix Hill charged {{from the}} back of the grid to third, having stalled on the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> lap from pole. He {{finished}} off the season finishing fourth in Japan and third in Australia, but it was not enough to hold 2nd place in the championship as Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last two races. Prost finished the season as champion. Hill ended the season in Australia by setting the lap record for the Adelaide Street Circuit. As of 2017 (the full Grand Prix track has not been used since 2000), Hill's lap record of 1:15.381 for the 3.780km (2.349mi) long track still stands.|$|E

5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Victory Test, {{again at}} Lord's, Miller {{came in at}} 3/108 and after a slow start, scored another century, taking 170 minutes to reach the mark before being removed for 118. He struck ten fours, all off which were driven. In the second innings, {{he came to the}} crease with four wickets down with Australia still in arrears. He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not {{collapse}} further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the schedule. To <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> for that match, Miller took 3/95 against the North of England.|$|E
