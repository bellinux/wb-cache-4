40|$|Cue: Rearing {{livestock}} {{for meat}} and milk production, or for sale, is often recommended {{as a way}} for poor families to escape from poverty. This may be true, but profitable livestock production is not free of cost. In fact, if livestock are to be healthy and productive they need investment, investment of time, resources and money. Dominic Minyoi is a Chief Veterinary Officer working for the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. He recently spoke to Chris Kakunta about the importance of investment, and why the first priority for livestock farmers is to invest in the health of their new born animals, such as calves and lambs. Allowing a new born animal to feed on its mother?s milk is an extremely important first investment, as it helps to protect the animal against prevailing diseases. IN:		?Once a calf is born ? OUT:		?too late for anybody to intervene. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 16 ?? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dominic Minyoi with advice for livestock keepers on the importance of investing in their animals. Transcript Minyoi	Once a calf is born it must be exposed to colostrum. Colostrum is the first milk that comes from the mother. Within 24 hours of birth that calf should be made to suckle with that one. It gives it all the protection because colostrum carries all the necessary antibodies to protect the calf against the prevailing diseases that are in that area. And also apart from that, most farmers you find they don?t really let the calf suckle. So from birth the calf should be let to suckle until they are satisfied, that?s when the farmers can get the milk. We do know that they rely on this milk as well but the calf needs it more for growth. And as the calf grows up they must at least organise the pasture, even from crop residues. They can put those in the kraal, whatever stover, maize stover that is left, whatever from the groundnuts and beans that can be fed to the animals during the dry season when the feed is inadequate. And it is important {{at this point in time}} that they must de-worm at least twice per year. This is before the rains and after the rains so that when the rains have come in and the grass is mushrooming, the calves have got access to grass; they can put on weight because they won?t have a worm burden. Vaccination is very very important in certain age groups. They can do that for anthrax, they can do that for all the other preventable diseases. Kakunta	Your emphasis has been on the calf. Are you saying when you look after a calf properly, you are guaranteeing that the future animals will be healthy? Minyoi	Definitely, once you start looking after a calf very well that calf will grow into a strong adult. And that strong adult can only be strong if it is also exposed to certain interventions like vaccinations, de-worming, good housing, provision of water, all those are things that should be made available to the animals. In the village set up they can even use troughs, these dug-out canoes; put water in there. The animals will have access to water whenever they feel like drinking water. Not where as of now, they graze somewhere else, they are taken for water somewhere else, and by the time they come back to the kraal they are really thirsty. So we should make these things available to the livestock for them to be able to live within the surroundings instead of venturing out where they might contract a disease through mixing with other cattle. Kakunta	There are certain situations here in Zambia, Dr Minyoi, for instance in the southern part of the country, where we have East Coast Fever, commonly known as Corridor Disease. We are finding that the small-scale farmers? animals are dying, while in the same area the commercial farmers? animals are still healthy. What practical lessons have you learned from such a scenario? Minyoi	What it is, is that to prevent tick-borne diseases, one must dip the animals. And communal dip tanks are there, they exist, but these people are not co-operating, to be able to come together so that they can have their animals dipped. People should be able to invest a bit in livestock, so that they can buy the dip chemicals. And they can approach our officers, our officers can assist them in prescribing what kind of chemicals to buy. They should be doing that twice a month in the rainy season, and once every month in the dry season. Because if they dip regularly, then Corridor Disease will be something that they will hear about but not really their concern. Kakunta	But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> farmers are so reluctant in terms of preventative measures? Does it mean there is a problem somewhere in terms of attitudes? Minyoi	I can attribute this partly to poor extension services. If the extension was good, farmers would have been taught how to look after animals, and then everybody would be taken on board. But what it is now, is that sometimes our extension is failing to reach the people. But where it is reaching some people don?t want to spend, they won?t invest in livestock. Livestock is a business just like any other business, they have to invest. And above all, they should attend to their regular requirements in as far as their health is concerned. Because these animals are just left to herdsmen, and when herdsmen come there is no request for a report. They should also keep their records so that these herdsmen are held accountable. Because what is happening, farmers don?t even know how the animals are, they are just told ?The animal is dead. ? And you can not run a business like that. They must be part and parcel of that livestock-rearing group. They must be able to monitor the animals and see how they are getting on, so that they can report on time. Reporting condition on time, or reporting a situation on time gets one better results than reporting late, because when you report late it may be too late for anybody to intervene. End of track.

40|$|Business sense {{needed from}} growers and {{government}} Cue: If farming {{is to be}} a profitable business, and not just a subsistence activity, there are two issues that farmers will need to think about very carefully: how to maximise their yields, and how to get the best price possible for their crop. With a cash crop such as cotton, there may be some help available for them to do both things. In Zambia, for example, {{there are a number of}} cotton promoting companies that depend on farmers to supply high quality cotton for their textile plants. Dunavant, Clark Cotton and Mulungushi are three such companies operating in the country, that are helping farmers both to grow and sell cotton. Despite this, however, the Zambian textile industry is struggling, not least because of a tax system which favours imported cotton, and makes Zambian cotton too expensive for the local industry to buy. Joseph Nkole is the Executive Secretary of the Cotton Producers Association of Zambia. He believes strongly that the government should be supporting its domestic cotton producers through a better tax system. He also believes that Zambia should be exploiting the Africa Growth Opportunity Act, known as AGOA, in order to export more cotton products to the United States. Under AGOA, a range of commodities, including finished clothes, can be exported without duty to the American market. Mr Nkole spoke recently, to Chris Kakunta, about how he believes the Zambian cotton industry can be resuscitated, or brought back to life. Chris began by asking how the cotton promoting companies were helping farmers in Zambia to increase their cotton production. IN:		?These organise the small-scale ? OUT:		? getting Bt into this country. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Joseph Nkole of the Cotton Producers Association of Zambia was talking to Chris Kakunta. Transcript Nkole	These organise the small-scale farmers into schemes that are provided with inputs for production. They go into providing extension services to the farmers and then they provide the market for the farmers. But what we are seeing as a base is to have now these farmers to be trained in the various skills. To have best practices where they are dealing with a particular promoter, not leapfrogging from one promoter to another and avoiding to pay back loans. We want the farmers to have good ethics, appreciate the sanctity of contracts, so that they can now start to do business on a business footing, so that they can grow into bigger entities and run business on their own. Kakunta	How best can a small-scale farmer look after his or her cotton crop so that it gives maximum yield? Nkole	Well principally the farmer must plant his cotton early, on time. He must weed his crop, he must control the pests and he must have the correct plant population. For me these are the four non-negotiables in cotton production and if a farmer handles those with optimum efficiency they are bound to get very good yields from a hectare of cotton. Kakunta	<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> yields are still low per hectare? Nkole	I think some farmers want to grow cotton as a by the way crop after they have planted maize or they have grown other crops. Now we are trying to get the farmers to appreciate that cotton is a main crop that they must engage in, plant on time, manage properly and they will see the good yields coming through. It has been done in many places and we are just hoping that we can now spread this to all the parts of the country where cotton is being grown. Kakunta	Zambia is part of the global village and obviously we have seen some cotton being imported into the country. Does that imported cotton affect the price of the local production and what are you doing to help the farmers have the better price? Nkole	There are two issues here. One is the issue of second-hand clothing. Two is the issue of tax on raw cotton. Imported cotton is costing less to the textile industry than Zambian cotton because of the tax regime. And we have identified this with the ginners, and the Zambia National Farmers Union and we are trying to talk to the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry and their counterparts in finance to see how best we can give the Zambian cotton a price good enough for export so that it competes with cottons coming from outside. Yes cotton from outside is cheaper and the only reason is truly due to the tax regime. If government decides to tackle the issue of internal taxation again the service-providing companies will pass the benefit to the farmers by increasing the price. On the other hand, we would also work as an association to lobby the promoting companies, to pay the farmers a price that is good enough. But for Zambia, really for the price to improve we must get our textile industry to process the cotton produced in this country into finished products. Then you can start to benefit even from AGOA and the price to the farmer will obviously be increased. And so we are saying let us get quickly to look at what is Mulungushi doing? What is Mukuba doing? What is Mulungushi-China doing? Let us get them to have to produce garments; then we can break into the AGOA. There is a lot of benefit in there. Our counterparts and colleagues in West Africa are benefiting from it and I think it is a question of time. Very soon we will have these meetings to discuss how the government can come in to help us resuscitate the textile industry and then see our lint being processed internally. Kakunta	What about coming to Bt cotton? Do you think if a law was passed in Zambia to allow such cotton to be grown, as an association you would embrace it? And if you are going to embrace it, why? Nkole	We would definitely want to work within the ambits of the law. What we are seeing is the benefit to the small cotton farmer, like the other colleagues in the region are getting. So if we were to say ?Yes?, we would say it would be a welcome idea because we stand to benefit as a nation by increased volumes. We are, in the meantime, collecting a lot of data and evidence to show that this has got advantage for us. And as I said, we will not fight the law. If the law of the land determines that we have no Bt cotton, we shall go by that. But as an association we would want to have further investigation and compare the advantages and disadvantages. And at the moment we are currently thinking that it would be worth our while to increase productivity, to increase profitability and enhance the standards of living of our smallholder cotton farmers by getting Bt cotton into this country.
