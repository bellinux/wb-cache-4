Since m is a parameter, the absolute value of the deviation can be controlled by adjusting the size of m, which effectively improves the constant deviation between the estimated <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficient</b> generated in the soft threshold function. Compared with the soft and hard thresholding function, the adaptive thresholding function proposed in this paper is a more superior and flexible choice.

Failure of this particular part can affect the machinery performance and in time will cause major failure to the machinery. Result of various studies shows that bearing problems account for over 40 % of all machine failures. Due to the crucial problem, online monitoring has become an alternative in preventive maintenance. The objective of this project is to develop software with signal processing tools to detect defect features in mechanical signal of the bearing. Five set of bearing were tested {{with one of them}} remains in good condition while the other four has its own type of defects. The data for good bearing were used as baseline data to compare with the defected ones. The data consist with three different speed rotation which are 287, 1466, and 2664 rpm.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{a method}} based on <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficients</b> in {{low-pass}} bands is {{proposed for the}} image classification with adaptive processing of data structures to organize a large image database. After an image is decomposed by wavelet, its features can be characterized by the distribution of histograms of <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The coefficients are respectively projected onto x and y directions. For different images, the distribution of histograms of <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficients</b> in low-pass bands is substantially different. However, the one in high-pass bands is not as different, which makes the performance of classification not reliable. This paper presents a method for image classification based on <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficients</b> in low-pass bands only. Images are arranged into a tree structure. The nodes can then be represented by the distribution of histograms of these <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficients.</b> 2940 images derived from seven categories are used for image classification. Based on the <b>wavelet</b> <b>coefficients</b> in low-pass bands, the improvement of classification rate on the training data set is up to 11 %, and the improvement of classification rate on the testing data set reaches 20 %. Experimental results show that our proposed approach for image classification is more effective and reliable. I...|$|R
