5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a <b>Woman)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> small oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes {{that form the}} lines of the woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E

5|$|Mandodari is {{described}} as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When Hanuman, the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita. When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita. Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like Sachi and Rohini.|$|E

5|$|The Haraldskær Woman (or Haraldskjaer <b>Woman)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E

25|$|The hymen is a {{membrane}} {{of tissue}} that surrounds or partially covers the vaginal opening. The effects of vaginal intercourse and childbirth on the hymen are variable. If the hymen is sufficiently elastic, it may return to nearly its original condition.

Additionally, the hymen may be lacerated by disease, injury, medical examination, masturbation or physical exercise. For these reasons, {{it is not possible}} to definitively determine whether or not a girl or <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> virgin by examining her hymen.|$|E

25|$|Hatshepsut had the {{expedition}} commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, {{which is also}} famous for its realistic depiction of the Queen of the Land of Punt, Queen Ati. The Puntite Queen is portrayed as relatively tall and her physique was generously proportioned, with large breasts and rolls of fat on her body. Due to the fat deposits on her buttocks, it has sometimes been argued {{that she may have}} had steatopygia. However, according to the pathologist Marc Armand Ruffer, the main characteristic of a steatopygous <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> disproportion in size between the buttocks and thighs, which was not the case with Ati. She instead appears to have been generally obese, a condition that was exaggerated by excessive lordosis or curvature of the lower spine. Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and Sinai shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.|$|E
25|$|A woman {{experiencing}} uterine blood {{not part}} of normal menstruation was classified as a zavah {{in the days of}} the Temple in Jerusalem and remained in a state of ritual impurity for 7 days prior to immersion. Today, the law of zavah remains in effect in Orthodox Judaism, in two respects. Due to extreme conditions in Roman Palestine in the time of the Amoraim, women's periods became irregular, and women became unable to determine whether or not their discharges were regular (niddah) or irregular (zavah). As a result, women adapted a stringency combining the niddah and zavah periods, refraining from intercourse and physical contact with their husbands for seven days of the zavah period following menstruation, for a total of approximately 12 days per month, which Orthodox women continue to observe today. The laws of zavah are also applied, as in Biblical times, to uterine blood discharges outside regular menstruation. Such circumstances are often interpreted leniently, however, and rabbinic stratagems have been devised to lessen their severity. Women experiencing irregularities (droplets) are sometimes advised to wear coloured underwear to mitigate the detectability of evidence of zavah status and hence a need to determine that a <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> zavah.|$|E

There is a friendly American tourist called Mr Schwartz, a beautiful but melancholy woman, a distinguished-looking man {{reading a book}} in German and three criminal types playing cards. Arriving at the hotel, they find it somewhat in chaos as it is only just opening {{at the start of}} the season. To Poirot, the hotel manager seems in too much of a nervous panic; the only efficient person is Gustave, the waiter. Talking to the manager and then to Schwartz again, Poirot learns that the beautiful <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Madame Grandier, who comes each year on the anniversary of her husband's death in the area, and that the distinguished-looking man is Dr Lutz, a Jewish refugee from the Nazis in Vienna. Poirot introduces himself to Schwartz as Monsieur Poirier, a silk merchant from Lyon. The next morning, when delivering coffee to his room, Gustave tells Poirot that in fact he is M. Drouet, a police inspector. They are now cut off in the hotel as the funicular has been damaged during the night, probably by sabotage. Poirot and Gustave discuss who Marrascaud could be among the guests and staff, which includes Jacques, the cook's husband. Poirot is intrigued as to why a rendezvous has been arranged in such an isolated place.|$|E
