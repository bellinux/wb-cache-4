25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things.

Backstage at the Aberdeen gig, Morrissey was taken ill and taken to hospital; he did not return {{for the rest of}} the tour.

6000|$|... “That {{shows what}} I said was true. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> first had it, it was new, {{and the sight}} of it gave you {{pleasure}}; but the pleasure consisted in the novelty and drollery of it, and after a little while, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>became</b> familiar with it, it ceased to give you pleasure, and then you did not value it.

2500|$|Later in the interview, Harrison voiced {{her opinion}} on the major {{difference}} between major record labels and independent labels, saying, [...] "Major labels {{have a system that}} you have to go through.

2500|$|Luciani was {{a restless}} child {{and at the}} age of ten in 1922 he was awestruck when a Capuchin friar came to his village to preach the Lenten sermons. From that moment he decided that he wanted to become a priest and he went to his father to ask for his permission. His father agreed and said to him: [...] "I hope that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> a priest you will be {{on the side of the}} workers, for Christ Himself would have been on their side".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1959, Smith, at age 44, Smith {{returned}} to the New York Yankees as [...] "a field executive with duties as a major and minor league scout." [...] Despite his business interests, Smith explained the attraction of returning to baseball:"It's simply that baseball gets in your blood and you can't get it out. Like being a compulsive gambler or something along those lines. [...] You know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> a manager, that you're going to be fired sooner or later, {{no matter how good}} a job you feel you are doing.

Andre Crouch: Live At Carnegie Hall was the best album that I'd heard at that time and then you went back to The Blind Boys and all the black gospel stuff and I thought, this is what I relate to because it's like R&B. My roots are more R&B roots; old style. So it started to come out in things like 'Good Job'." ...|$|R

6000|$|There {{was nothing}} more said about it on that day. Mrs. Western, in whose bosom {{something}} of her feeling of anger against her husband was most unjustly extended towards Lady Grant, took care that they two should not be at once left together again. Mrs. Holt was studiously civil, but always with a feeling that Mr. Western and Lady Grant were brother and sister. It was probable that the sister would take her brother's part and consequently be at any moment converted into an enemy. The first evening at Exeter was passed very uncomfortably by the three ladies. But on the following morning a conference was demanded. [...] "My dear," [...] said Lady Grant, [...] "we have got to discuss all this and we may as well do it at once.
