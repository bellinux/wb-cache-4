25|$|The show's {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media. Moreover, {{the show has}} been criticized for putting witnesses in danger by revealing their faces and their voices on a nationally televised program and for not being sensitive to <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them in the form of retaliation. In response to such criticism, witnesses often ask producers to have their faces blurred out and voices changed or to speak off camera.|$|E
25|$|Amid the Diocletian Persecutions, Anthony {{wished to}} become a martyr and in 311 went to Alexandria. He visited those who were imprisoned {{for the sake of}} Christ and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his Christianity publicly, not caring <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be {{tortured}} and martyred, but it did not happen.|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E

500|$|Until 1998, Shearer {{was paid}} $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox {{threatened}} {{to replace the}} six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Shearer received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later, and Shearer's pay rose to $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. On May 13, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough. Al Jean made {{a statement from the}} producers saying [...] "the show must go on," [...] but did not elaborate on <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the characters Shearer voiced. On July 7, 2015, Shearer agreed to continue with the show, on the same terms as the other voice actors.|$|E
500|$|The US ran a {{propaganda}} campaign through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{to enhance the}} size of the southward exodus. The program was directed by Colonel Edward Lansdale, who masqueraded as the assistant US air attaché in Saigon while leading a covert group that specialised in psychological warfare. Lansdale had advised Diem that it was imperative to maximise the population in the south in preparation for the national reunification elections. When Diem noted the limited ability of the south to absorb refugees, Lansdale assured him that the US would bear the burden. Diem thus authorised Lansdale to launch the propaganda campaign. According to the historian Seth Jacobs, the campaign [...] "ranked with the most audacious enterprises in the history of covert action". Lansdale recollected that [...] "U.S. officials {{wanted to make sure that}} as many persons as possible, particularly the strongly anti-communist Catholics, relocated in the South". While many Diem supporters claimed that the mass exodus was proof of the popularity of Diem and the people's hatred of communism, the CIA operative Chester Cooper said [...] "the vast movement of Catholics to South Vietnam was not spontaneous". However, while Lansdale is often credited by historians—usually those critical of his influence—with the large exodus of refugees due to superstition, he rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment, saying in later years: [...] "People don’t just pull up their roots and transplant themselves because of slogans. They honestly feared <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them, and their emotion was strong enough to overcome their attachment to their land, their homes, and their ancestral graves. So the initiative was very much theirs—and we mainly made the transportation possible." [...] Some northerners who stayed behind and were interviewed half a century later said that they had not come across any pro-migration propaganda and said that their decisions were based on discussions with fellow locals. They said that concerns over the possible effects of communist rule were discussed among themselves independent of outside information.|$|E
2500|$|White abolitionists did {{not agree}} on how freed {{people ought to be}} treated. While some {{advocated}} full redistribution of land, others did not support any type of race mixing. Plans for a colony began in 1801 when James Monroe asked President Thomas Jefferson to help create a penal colony for rebellious blacks. The American Colonization Society formed in 1816 {{to address the issue of}} free African Americans through resettlement abroad. By 1860, the ACS had settled thousands of Africans in Liberia. But colonization was slow and unappealing to many, and as mass emancipation loomed there was no clear understanding of <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> millions of soon-to-be-free blacks. This issue had long been known to White authorities as [...] "The Negro Problem".|$|E

60|$|It may be well to {{remember}} that the highest level of moral aspiration recorded in history was reached by a few ancient Jews--Micah, Isaiah, and the rest--who took no count whatever of <b>what</b> <b>might</b> or <b>what</b> <b>might</b> not <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them after death.
