In specific, cochineal-, indigo- and iron-gall based inks have been investigated; some prepared following ancient recipes and others by using synthetic materials. The THz investigations have been realized on both pellet samples, made by dried inks blended with polyethylene powder, and layered inks, made by liquid deposition on polyethylene pellicles. We implemented an improved THz spectroscopic technique that enabled the measurement of the material optical parameters and thicknesses of the layered ink samples on absolute scale. This experimental investigation shows that the THz techniques have the potentiality to recognize drawing inks by their spectroscopic features...|$|E
40|$|Short {{cellulose}} nanofibrils (SCNF) {{were investigated}} as a reinforcement for polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers. SCNF fibers were mechanically isolated from hard wood pulp after enzymatic pretreatment. Various levels of SCNF {{were added to}} PVA and gel-spun into continuous fibers. The molecular orientation of PVA was affected {{by a combination of}} <b>wet</b> <b>drawing</b> during gel spinning and post-hot-drawing at a high temperature after drying. A maximum total draw ratio of 27 was achieved with various SCNF contents investigated. The PVA crystal orientation increased when small amounts of SCNF were added, but decreased again as the SCNF content was increased above about 2 or 3 %, likely due to SCNF percolation resulting in network formation that inhibited alignment. SCNF fillers were effective in improving PVA fiber tensile properties (i. e., ultimate strength and elastic modulus). Shifts in the Raman peak at ~ 1095 cm- 1, which were associated with the C–O–C glycosidic bond of SCNF, indicated good stress transfer between the SCNF and the PVA matrix due to strong interfacial hydrogen bonding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High speed multi pass <b>wet</b> wire <b>drawing</b> {{has become}} very common for {{production}} of high carbon steel cord because {{of the increase in}} customer demand and production rates in real industrial fields. Although the <b>wet</b> wire <b>drawing</b> is preformed at a high speed usually above 1000 m/min, greater speed is required to improve productivity. However, in the high carbon steel wire drawing, the wire temperature rises greatly as the drawing speed increase. The excessive temperature rise makes the wire more brittle and finally leads to wire breaks. In this study, the variations in wire temperature during <b>wet</b> wire <b>drawing</b> process were investigated. A multi pass <b>wet</b> wire <b>drawing</b> process with 21 passes, which was used to produce steel cord, was redesigned by considering the increase in temperature. Through a <b>wet</b> wire <b>drawing</b> experiment, it was possible to increase the maximum final speed from 1000 m/min to 2000 m/min...|$|R

40|$|Dry and <b>wet</b> <b>drawing</b> {{materials}} were investigated by THz time-domain spectroscopy in transmission mode. Carbon-based and iron-gall inks have been studied, some prepared following ancient recipes and others using current synthetic materials; a commercial ink was studied as well. We measured the THz signals on thin film of liquid inks deposited on polyethylene pellicles, comparing the results with the thick pellets of dried inks blended with polyethylene powder. This study required {{the implementation of}} a new experimental method and data analysis procedure able to provide a reliable extraction of the material transmission parameters from a structured sample composed of thin layers, down to thickness of few tens of micrometers. THz measurements on thin ink layers enabled the determination of both the absorption and the refractive index in an absolute scale in the 0. 1 - 3 THz range, as well as the layer thickness. THz spectroscopic features of a paper sheet dyed by one of the iron-gall inks were also investigated. Our results showed that THz time-domain spectroscopy enables to discriminate the various inks on different supports, including the application on paper, together with a proper determination of the absorption coefficients and indices of refraction...|$|E

60|$|The {{effect of}} this sublime {{spectacle}} {{on the minds of}} the exploring party is a little injured {{by the nature of the}} direct conclusion to which the sight of it points--the said conclusion being that the mountain mist has actually gathered round them, as the landlord feared it would.

40|$|People are {{increasingly}} engaging in recreational activities in nature. However, preferences for recreation opportunities are changing {{over time and}} among different people. Furthermore, different settings offer unique combinations of attributes; these attributes generate occasions for tourists to achieve particular recreation experiences, albeit tourists create experiences differently.

40|$|Water and {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} have different wetting angles to a glass surface, where water has a lower angle. In a microfluidic channel, the lower <b>wetting</b> angle <b>draws</b> the water to surround the {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} and the supercritical carbon dioxide therefore easily form droplets or segments if the flow rate is low. In this study, the flow of supercritical carbon dioxide and water has been studied in a microfluidic system with a double Y-channel. The micro channels have been built in borofloat glass to withstand high mechanical and chemical forces, still enabling in situ characterization. The aim has been to analyze flow changes {{in the water and}} supercritical carbon dioxide in structured channels with and without surface modification.             The result shows that the flow regime of supercritical carbon dioxide and water can be controlled by changing flow rates, adding walls, or coating a channel as well as any combination of these three. If adding a large enough wall in a channel, the flow will be segmented only in half the channel at moderate flow rates from both sources, and parallel if the flow rate of supercritical carbon dioxide is high enough. A non-polar coating of half a channel will make the supercritical carbon dioxide flow along the coated side and supercritical carbon dioxide can by that way be forced to only take one of the outlets. However, still water exit at both outlets...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{nanotechnology}} {{to develop}} methods for fabrication and characterization of organized hybrid nanostructures that include integrated polymeric, biological and inorganic compounds has increased exponentially {{during the last}} decade. Such bio-nano-composite materials {{could be used in}} solving current biomedical problems spanning from nanomedicine to tissue engineering and biosensing. In this dissertation, a systematic study has been carried out on the synthesis, characterization, of two interfaces between naturally derived and synthetic nanostructures. Carbon nanotubes and porous silicon represent the synthetic nanostructures that were developed for the purpose of interfacing with the naturally derived bovine type I collagen and respiratory syncytial virus DNA respectively. Firstly, the synthesis of collagen-carbon nanotubes by two different techniques: fibrillogenesis through slow <b>wet</b> fiber <b>drawing</b> (gelation process) and electrospinning has been highlighted. Characterization of the novel nanocomposite was conducted using electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nanoindentation, and Raman spectroscopy. The collagen-carbon nanotube gelation process was found to have superior nanoscale surface mechanical properties that were more conducive to higher osteoblast specific protein expression such as osteocalcin. Applications of the developed nanofibers are detailed in the fields of orthopaedics and tissue engineering. Secondly, an overview of porous silicon synthesized by hydrofluoric acid is presented. A parametric study was performed to determine the optimal pore size was carried out. The use of porous silicon as a biosensor to detect RSV virus by DNA hybridization was then provided and the importance of the interface chemistry was highlighted...|$|R

40|$|During {{spontaneous}} imbibition a <b>wetting</b> {{liquid is}} <b>drawn</b> into a porous medium by capillary forces. In systems with comparable pore length and diameter, such as paper and sand, {{the front of}} the propagating liquid forms a continuous interface. Sections of this interface advance in a highly correlated manner due to an effective surface tension, which restricts front broadening. Here we investigate water imbibition in a nanoporous glass (Vycor) in which the pores are much longer than they are wide. In this case, no continuous liquid-vapor interface with coalesced menisci can form. Anomalously fast imbibition front roughening is experimentally observed by neutron imaging. We propose a theoretical pore network model, whose structural details are adapted to the microscopic pore structure of Vycor glass, and show that it displays the same large scale roughening characteristics as observed in the experiment. The model predicts that menisci movements are uncorrelated. This indicates that despite the connectivity of the network the smoothening effect of surface tension on the imbibition front roughening is negligible. These results suggest a new universality class of imbibition behavior which is expected to occur in any matrix with elongated, interconnected pores of random radii. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
