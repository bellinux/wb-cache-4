50|$|The 'dead centre' of a {{piston engine}} <b>with</b> <b>cranks</b> {{is when the}} piston is at the exact top or bottom of the stroke and so the piston cannot exert any torque on the crankshaft. If a steam engine stops on dead centre, it {{will be unable to}} restart from that position.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} layout {{was primarily}} chosen {{to reduce the}} impact of the inertial torsion inherent <b>with</b> <b>crank</b> throws spaced 90° apart due to the pistons being accelerated (start-stop motion), given this engine was meant to be high revving and inertial forces scale as to the square of engine speed. The reduction in torsion was achieved by splitting the crank into two separate parts, geared together, from their respective midpoints, via a counter-shaft, from which power was delivered to the gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor {{made their}} feature film debut <b>with</b> <b>Crank,</b> a 2006 film {{starring}} Jason Statham. The duo later wrote and produced the 2008 thriller Pathology.

The duo were originally slated to direct the film adaptation of DC Comics's Jonah Hex, but stepped down due to creative differences with film distributor Warner Bros.

50|$|Inline five {{cylinder}} (L5) engine, <b>with</b> <b>crank</b> throws at 72° {{phase shift}} to each other, {{is the common}} five cylinder configuration. Exceptions are Honda racing V5, and Volkswagen VR5 engine. These typical L5 engines have 13. Evenly spaced firing and perfect 3. Phase balance on reciprocating mass, with 4. Plane imbalance on reciprocating mass, 6. Plane imbalance on rotating mass, 14. Plane imbalance on torque generation, and 16. Plane imbalance on compression. Just like in inline 3 engines above, these first order rocking couples can be countered with heavy counterweights, and the secondary balance is comparable to, or better than an ordinary inline 6 {{because there are no}} piston pairs that move together.|$|E

The resulting fiasco was the prime reason The Icarus Line didn't record their debut album in 1999, as originally intended, and ended up signing instead <b>with</b> <b>Crank!</b> Records. Coincidentally, Ink & Dagger, who had also signed to the label for the release of their third and last album, ended up having Buddyhead release it instead. Other bands on the short-lived label included Discount (band) and Kind Of Like Spitting. The label's folding, resulted in this release being out of print for many years, and a highly sought after collectable.|$|E

We streamline Dyson's bijection relating partitions <b>with</b> <b>crank</b> ⩽k and those with k in the Rank-Set of partitions. Also, we extend Dyson's adjoint of a partition to MacMahon's “modular” partitions with modulus 2. This way we find a new combinatorial proof of Gauss's famous identity.
