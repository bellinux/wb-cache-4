The letter was from the brother of Heidsieck's former agent in New York.

25|$|The Smiths dressed {{mainly in}} {{ordinary}} clothes– jeans and plain shirts– {{in keeping with}} the back-to-basics, guitar-and-drums style of the music. This contrasted with the exotic high-fashion image cultivated by New Romantic pop groups such as Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran and highlighted in magazines such as The Face and i-D. In 1986, when the Smiths performed on the British music programme The Old Grey Whistle Test, Morrissey wore a fake hearing-aid to support a hearing-impaired fan who <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> using one, and also frequently wore thick-rimmed National Health Service-style glasses.|$|E

25|$|Charles Haigh-Wood {{inherited}} his mother's property {{when she}} died, {{as well as}} the family home at 14 Albion Place, Walmersley Road, Bury, and he became a landlord, which allowed him to move his wife and Haigh-Wood to Hampstead, a fashionable part of north London. They settled into a house there at 3 Compayne Gardens around 1891. Haigh-Wood's brother, Maurice, was born there in 1896; he went on to train at Sandhurst and fought during the First World War. Although the family was clearly well-to-do, Seymour-Jones writes that Haigh-Wood <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> her connection to Lancashire, perceived as working-class, and was left with a sense of inferiority that made her self-conscious and snobbish, especially when mixing with Eliot's aristocratic London friends.|$|E
25|$|Still, he {{knew that}} his mother was still alive and refused to attend the funeral at Corinth. To ease the tension, the {{messenger}} then said that Oedipus was, in fact, adopted. Jocasta, finally realizing that he was her son, begged him to stop his search for Laius' murderer. Oedipus misunderstood her motivation, thinking that she <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> him because he might have been born of low birth. Jocasta in great distress went into the palace where she hanged herself. Oedipus sought verification of the messenger's story from the very same herdsman who was supposed to have left Oedipus to die as a baby. From the herdsman, Oedipus learned that the infant raised as the adopted son of Polybus and Merope was the son of Laius and Jocasta. Thus, Oedipus finally realized that the man he had killed so many years before, at the place where the three roads met, was his own father, King Laius, and that he had married his mother, Jocasta.|$|E
25|$|Word of {{the actions}} in Obligado spread around the continent. Most of the press, that so far had {{repeated}} the Montevidean libels, turned instead to support Rosas. Brazilian newspapers such as O Brado de Amazonas and O Sentinella da Monarchia referred to Rosas as a great South American hero. Francisco Antonio Pinto, former president of Chile, declared that the Chilean people <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> the presence in Chile {{of a pair of}} newspapers that supported the Anglo-French cause. The president of Bolivia José Ballivián, who was so far against Rosas, instructed his diplomat Manuel Rodríguez to congratulate Rosas for the action of Obligado and protest with reason of the disloyal and unjust Anglo-French intervention in the Río de la Plata against the rights and interests of the Americas. José de San Martín wrote a supporting letter to Rosas and, despite his old age, offered his military assistance. He also {{wrote a letter to the}} British Morning Chronicle, explaining that a military occupation of Buenos Aires by Anglo-French forces would be nearly impossible.|$|E

Goode interpreted Veidt's back-story to portray him with a German accent in private and an American one in public; Goode explained Veidt gave up his family's wealth and traveled the world, becoming a self-made man because he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> his parents' Nazi past, which in turn highlighted the themes of the American Dream and the character's duality. [...] Snyder said Goode [...] "fit the bill.... We were having a hard time casting , because we needed someone handsome, beautiful and sophisticated, and that's a tough combo." ...|$|E
500|$|Squall {{appears as}} a non-playable {{character}} in Kingdom Hearts. He wears a short leather jacket with red wings on the back (resembling the decorations on Rinoa's duster) and his Griever necklace. Squall takes the name Leon as an alias, because he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> not protecting those he loved from the Heartless when his home world (the Radiant Garden) was consumed by darkness. His role in Kingdom Hearts is to help guide the protagonist, Sora, in his battle (with other Final Fantasy characters) against the Heartless. Although Squall's appearance and age differ (he is 25 in Kingdom Hearts and 17 in Final Fantasy VIII), his personality remains the same. A memory-based version of Squall (as Leon) appears in [...] teaching gameplay in a tutorial. Leon's jacket later has a fur lining on its collar, which did {{not appear in the}} first Kingdom Hearts game. In this game, he works with his friends to restore their world. Squall also {{appears as a}}n opponent in Olympus Coliseum tournaments, often paired with other Final Fantasy characters. His virtual replica appears in Kingdom Hearts coded, where it meets Sora's virtual replica.|$|E

[...] After her first New York Times Bestseller in 2005, Bly realized that her readers liked her writing regardless of its genre, and that by keeping her identity a secret she was implying that she <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> her work and of her readers. [...] At a February 16, 2005 faculty meeting, Bly outed herself to her colleagues, revealing her alter ego and offering copies of her novels to her fellow professors.

2500|$|... 25,000 people {{wrote to}} city leaders {{urging them to}} rescind the letter. Some members {{of the city council}} regretted their vote after the motion passed. Councilwoman Betty Olds said she <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> her vote. On February 4, 2008, Council members Betty Olds and Laurie Capitelli called on the council to rescind the letter to the Marines and to declare that Berkeley was against the war but {{supported}} the troops. On February 12, 2008, the council met to reconsider the Marine Corps Recruiting motions. On this day, at its peak, 2,000 protesters gathered outside city hall, with one group protesting against the city council motion that included Move America Forward, and the other, consisting mainly of Code Pink, protesting in support of the motions. [...] The two sides faced each other with police separating them on Martin Luther King Jr. Way; both sides exchanged songs, chants, flag waves, yells, and obscenities. The protest lasted 24 hours, ending at around 1:00 am on February 13. There were four arrests. The City of Berkeley spent $93,000 in police overtime on February 12 as part of a large police presence to keep the peace.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace cited one {{inspiration}} for Ben-Hur, recounting his life-changing journey {{and talk with}} Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll, a well-known agnostic and public speaker, whom he met on a train when the two were bound for Indianapolis on September 19, 1876. Ingersoll invited Wallace {{to join him in}} his railroad compartment during the trip. The two men debated religious ideology, and Wallace left the discussion realizing how little he knew about Christianity. He became determined to do his own research to write about the history of Christ. Wallace explained: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> myself, and make haste now to declare that the mortification of pride I then endured… ended in a resolution to study the whole matter, if only for the gratification there might be in having convictions of one kind or another." [...] It is not known for certain when Wallace decided to write a novel based on the life of Christ, but he had already written the manuscript for a magazine serial about the three Magi at least two years before his discussions with Ingersoll. Researching and writing about Christianity helped Wallace become clear about his own ideas and beliefs. He developed the novel from his own exploration of the subject.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1916 Lloyd George (then War Secretary) sought French's {{advice about}} recent press {{criticism}} of British artillery and discipline, then {{sent him to}} France to sound out {{the opinion of the}} French generals about why the French had gained ground with fewer losses on the Somme. Foch (C-in-C French Army Group North) refused to be drawn, although he confessed to Wilson that Haig's methods invited criticism, and Haig refused to meet him, sending an aide Lt-Col Alan Fletcher, telling him [...] "I would not receive Viscount French in my house. I despise him too much personally for that, but he would receive every attention due to a British Field Marshal". [...] Haig and Robertson were both concerned that Lloyd George might appoint French CIGS in Robertson's place. [...] On 25 November 1916 the King summoned French to Buckingham Palace and warned him to stop criticising Haig. In January 1917 French refused an invitation from Derby to dine with Haig, but on 22 June, after pressure from the King, a meeting was arranged for French and Haig to bury the hatchet, at which, by Haig's account, French confessed that in his bitterness at being removed from command he had [...] "said things then which he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> now". Haig, according to his own diary, congratulated him for [...] "speaking out like a man" [...] and they shook hands as they parted, but their rapprochement was short-lived.|$|E
2500|$|Bodenheimer (1979, pp 299–300) {{believes}} that the narrator {{is interested in the}} psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world. Matus (2007, pp.35–43) also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of [...] "interiority" [...] (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' [...] "trance of passion". The phrase [...] "as if" [...] appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration (O'Farrell, 1997, p 16): [...] "Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 11) and [...] " [...] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical" [...] (chapter 19). The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: [...] "As if she felt his look, she turned to him" [...] (chapter 22); [...] "He had shaken off his emotion as if he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> ever giving way to it" [...] (chapter 28), and [...] "She lifted up her head, as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown" [...] (chapter 39). Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins (Matus, 2007, p 40): [...] " ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart" [...] (chapter 39).|$|E
2500|$|After Sondheim {{finished}} Evening Primrose, Jerome Robbins {{asked him}} to adapt Bertolt Brecht's The Measures Taken despite the composer's general dislike of Brecht's work. Robbins wanted to adapt another Brecht play, The Exception and the Rule, and asked John Guare to adapt the book. Leonard Bernstein had not written for the stage in some time, and his contract as conductor of the New York Philharmonic was ending. Sondheim was invited to Robbins' house {{in the hope that}} Guare would convince him to write the lyrics for a musical version of The Exception and the Rule; according to Robbins, Bernstein would not work without Sondheim. When Sondheim agreed, Guare asked: [...] "Why haven't you all worked together since West Side Story?" [...] Sondheim answered, [...] "You'll see". Guare said that working with Sondheim was like being with an old college roommate, and he depended on him to [...] "decode and decipher their crazy way of working"; Bernstein worked only after midnight, and Robbins only in the early morning. Bernstein's score, which was supposed to be light, was influenced by his need to make a musical statement. Stuart Ostrow, who worked with Sondheim on The Girls Upstairs, agreed to produce the musical (now entitled A Pray By Blecht and, later, The Race to Urga). An opening night was scheduled, but during auditions Robbins asked to be excused for a moment. When he did not return, a doorman said he had gotten into a limousine to go to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Bernstein burst into tears and said, [...] "It's over"; Sondheim said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> the whole project. It was arch and didactic in the worst way." [...] He wrote one-and-a-half songs and threw them away, the only time he has ever done that. Eighteen years later, Sondheim refused Bernstein and Robbins' request to retry the show.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E
