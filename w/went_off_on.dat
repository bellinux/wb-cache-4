5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> strange tangents. The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed to countries including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Once {{there was}} a {{competition}} between Ganesha and his brother as to see who could circumambulate the three worlds faster and hence win the fruit of knowledge. Skanda <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> a journey to cover the three worlds while Ganesha simply circumambulated his parents. When asked why he did so, he answered that his parents Shiva and Parvati constituted the three worlds and was thus given the fruit of knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Twain's last {{work was}} his autobiography, which he {{dictated}} and {{thought would be}} most entertaining if he <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> whims and tangents in non-chronological order. Some archivists and compilers have rearranged the biography into a more conventional form, thereby eliminating some of Twain's humor and {{the flow of the}} book. The first volume of the autobiography, over 736pages, was published by the University of California in November 2010, 100years after his death, as Twain wished. It soon became an unexpected best seller, making Twain one of a very few authors publishing new best-selling volumes in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.|$|E

25|$|Fulci and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti {{share many}} screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films {{were written by}} Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his own in 1983 to direct Conquest in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was {{supposed}} to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up doing quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.|$|E

But it is a big story because it is an American girl who <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. [...] "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch… If they say, 'I {{want to know what happened}} to this girl'… I want to help them find out." ...|$|E

According to Japan Pop!: Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture, after this experience in a music group, she <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> her own to develop a solo music career, and became a megastar. Cruising the Anime City: An Otaku Guide to Neo Tokyo described Sakurada as a 1970s music idol, like Pink Lady and Linda Yamamoto.|$|E

Monsoon also used [...] "will you stop" [...] when either Ventura, Heenan or any other heels he was commentating with would mention what a bad job referee Joey Marella was doing, the joke being that Marella was Monsoon's real life adopted son, a fact not well known among wrestling fans at the time.|$|E

[...] Then he <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his own to collect samples and investigate the Vale of Clwyd, looking in vain for the Old Red Sandstone shown by Greenough. They met up in Colwyn, and Sedgwick's pleasure at the confirmation that the map was incorrect made Darwin [...] "exceedingly proud". They went on to Capel Curig where Charles struck out on his own across 30miles (50km) of [...] "some strange wild places" [...] to Barmouth. He had parted from Sedgwick by 20 August, and travelled via Ffestiniog.|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{was born}} Richard Walter Jenkins Jr. on 10 November 1925 {{in a house}} at 2 Dan-y-bont in Pontrhydyfen, Neath Port Talbot, in Wales. He was the twelfth of {{thirteen}} children born to Richard Walter Jenkins Sr. (1876-1957), and Edith Maude Jenkins (née Thomas; 1883-1927). Jenkins Sr., called Daddy Ni by the family, was a coal miner, while his mother worked as a barmaid at a pub called the Miner's Arms, which was also {{the place where she}} met and married her husband. According to biographer Melvyn Bragg, Richard is quoted saying that Daddy Ni was a [...] "twelve-pints-a-day man" [...] who sometimes <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> drinking and gambling sprees for weeks, and that [...] "he looked very much like me".

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1994, Walden secured star running back Troy Davis out of [...] Miami, Florida. Davis later had {{consecutive}} 2,000-yard rushing seasons, but after Walden's departure. After starting the 1994 campaign 0–2, many fans began to criticize his coaching ability. [...] He began his weekly press conference by handing out the past records of Dennis Erickson, Johnny Majors, and Earle Bruce while they were at Washington State and Iowa State. He then handed out Iowa State's overall record in football since fielding its first team in 1892, which, at the time, was 423–461–45, a [...]480 percentage, and compared his record to that one. [...] Walden claimed that he was as good a coach or better than Erickson, Majors, and Bruce. On Thursday, November 3, 1994, after starting the season 0–7–1, Walden informed his team that he would resign at season's end. [...] He was allowed to coach his final three games by the university, but banned from coaching his last game at Colorado because of criticizing the officials after the Kansas State game. [...] Kansas State's Nyle Wiren had body-slammed Walden's quarterback Todd Doxzon into the turf head first.

2500|$|After {{a series}} of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets {{a job as a}} {{department}} store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole, where the real Santa Claus has sold out to Hydra. [...] Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. [...] This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp. [...] While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. [...] Although we last saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. [...] The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous. [...] Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead. He then encountered Namor, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains {{that he would not be}} lugging his friend's body if that were the case. [...] Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor. [...] Once he sees that Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says he is returning to Cleveland.|$|E
