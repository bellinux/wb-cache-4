[...] That was fine with the family, and the boy's name was Buck from then on." [...] He attended public school for grades 13 in Garland, Texas.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} why I {{should not}} manage it very well," [...] said Ermine, cheerfully, [...] "if Miss Curtis will let me know in time whether she is equal to seeing me. You know I can <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> now." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot in}} 1995. It shows {{black-white}} video of house and a colorful boy, who <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> song is mixed with a child's voice singing [...] "When I grow up, {{there will be a}} day when everybody has to do what I say", and shouting.|$|R
6000|$|His {{retainer}} {{listened in}} silence, looking at Umslopogaas rather sulkily. Then we <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> As we went the Captain said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, just home, this minute." [...] And then Mr. Robarts <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> his {{portmanteau}} following on a foot-boy's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucy Snowe is a tatter-box," [...] I {{heard her}} say (her {{imperfect}} articulation was the least precocious thing she had about her); and with this; she <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
60|$|Without haste, {{but without}} hesitation, she <b>walked</b> quietly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
60|$|Accordingly {{a little}} before ten they <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{gambling}} <b>house</b> together.|$|R
6000|$|... "People <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> without ceremony. There is much {{kindness}} but no politeness. Mr. Britling will go {{away for}} three or four days, and when he returns and I come forward to greet him and bow, he will walk right past me, or he will say just like this, 'How do, Heinrich?'" ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and {{was here}} {{introduced}} to Noel Urner. The table {{was at once}} spread, and soon both Allen and Ike Watson were regaling themselves to their heart's content.|$|E
6000|$|... "Clara, my love!" [...] {{said the}} baronet, hastily wiping his eyes, and {{succeeding}} {{his wife in}} the embrace of their child. He kissed her, and, pressing Francis by the hand, <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in silence.|$|E
60|$|She {{said she}} was {{standing}} by the side door, taking the air, when Señor d'Aguilar appeared, and, having greeted her, without more words <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> saying that he had an appointment with the master.|$|E
50|$|Dark <b>House</b> tells <b>the</b> {{story of}} <b>the</b> Old Darrode <b>House,</b> where Janet Darrode ran {{a foster home}} for {{children}} and then murdered all of them and killed herself.

50|$|Back in Kolkata, Joydeep drives {{her down}} to {{the part of the}} city where she {{believes}} her house and her family are.

She <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> reunited with her 'real' family and is never seen again.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{your back}} up again; I don't mean to offend you, I tell you; however, if you {{remember}} what I have said to you, it may prevent much trouble to you:"--and Ussher <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
60|$|Soon {{the boys}} were piling out on the ground, and a general {{handshaking}} followed. Those {{who did not know}} each other were introduced, and everybody <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> where a room upstairs had been prepared for the cadets' reception.|$|E
60|$|Norman felt as if, {{while his}} father {{looked at him as}} he now did, {{the rest of the world}} were nothing to him; but, perhaps, the driving past the school brought him to a {{different}} mind, for he <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> slowly and dejectedly.|$|E
50|$|A.J. {{returns home}} {{as late as}} Tony and, by quickly driving up the driveway, even startles his father into {{thinking}} it is an ambush on his life. <b>The</b> two <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> together to find Carmela and Meadow having a late night snack. Carmela tells them Meadow had a new mystery date. Meanwhile, Chris arrives at his residence, walks through his ravaged front yard, and staggers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the Miles family home, Billy, now highly suspicious, {{enters and}} pulls his {{gun on the}} man {{who appears to be}} his father. After the confrontation, Billy relinquishes his gun, at which point the other man {{physically}} morphs and reveals himself to be the Alien Bounty Hunter.

60|$|The swiftest {{pace and}} the {{shortest}} road {{took him to}} the gate, and he was pausing to open it deliberately, that he might <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> with an appearance of perfect composure, when Maggie came out at the front door in bonnet and shawl. His conjecture was fulfilled, and he waited for her at the gate. She started violently when she saw him.|$|R
6000|$|Red <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{and said}} cheerfully, [...] "Time for lunch, I guess."

6000|$|... "If I know master," [...] said Spooner, [...] "he's {{not the man}} {{to get rid of}} an old woman, easy like that, {{and then}} 'ave her back agin."

6000|$|Webb's {{horse was}} tied to the rack. He <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and brought out his roll of {{blankets}} that he never took with him except on long rides, and his [...] "slicker," [...] and his longest stake-rope of plaited raw-hide. These he began to tie deliberately upon his saddle. Santa, a little pale, followed him.|$|E
60|$|Stately and solemn was the {{recognition}} which she accorded to Luke's salutation, {{and then she}} <b>walked</b> on <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
60|$|When Dora Bannister {{had gone}} away in Miss Panney's phaeton, Miriam <b>walked</b> gravely <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> {{followed}} by her brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} {{success in a}} praiseworthy attempt," [...] she said, with a sudden coldness. She turned and <b>walked</b> {{directly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He did, did he?" [...] said she. [...] "And that is {{the kind}} of a man he is. Very good. Let him go to jail with the others. I don't believe one word about his young wife. If kissing respectable young women is the way he studies Realism the quicker he goes to jail the better," [...] and with that she <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me speechless, and turned and <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> I thought I had sinned past forgiveness, and I was beyond {{description}} uncomfortable, for he had been like a parent to me. But the next morning, at half after seven, {{he walked into the}} little office and laid down some gold pieces on my table. Gold was very scarce in those days.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, my boy! what a fright {{you have}} given me!” Lady Castlewood said, when Harry Esmond came up, {{greeting}} him {{with one of her}} shining looks, and a voice of tender welcome; and she was so kind as to kiss the young man (’twas the second time she had so honoured him), and she <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> between him and her son, holding a hand of each.|$|E
60|$|Their <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was silent, {{and their}} {{thoughts}} {{were drawn from}} the unpleasant topic by finding a letter from Julia, announcing her intended departure from this country, and her wish to take leave of them in London before she sailed. As she had mentioned the probable day for that event, both the ladies were delighted to find it was posterior to the time fixed by Sir Edward for their own visit to the capital.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Little Big Girl", Bart {{is awarded}} a driver's license. Bart is {{seen at the}} chalkboard writing [...] "So long suckers". He bursts through the school doors in Homer's car, instead of on his skateboard, and speeds away. Instead of dodging all the {{obstacles}} seen in the standard opening sequence, he runs them over. As Homer pulls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> driveway and steps out to enter <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>the</b> other car lands on him, and Bart <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jane {{tries to}} leave <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{in her car}} but cannot start it. As she comes back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> she hears strange noises and calls for Norman. She finds him in his dress uniform, telling her to stay away. Norman is hurt and dying, and Dr. Mendez <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Jane runs over to him, but he bites her as Norman shoots him. Jane points his gun at her own head and two shots are heard just as the police arrive on the scene.|$|R
