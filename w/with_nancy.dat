5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect.

While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E
