5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work {{together}} on Kahn's <b>wormhole</b> experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial <b>wormhole</b> in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.|$|E

5|$|If {{one end of}} a <b>wormhole</b> was {{positively}} charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.|$|E

25|$|<b>Wormholes</b> are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists {{postulate}} could connect two arbitrary {{points in}} the universe, across an Einstein–Rosen Bridge. It is not known whether <b>wormholes</b> are possible in practice. Although there are solutions to the Einstein equation of general relativity that allow for <b>wormholes,</b> all of the currently known solutions involve some assumption, for example the existence of negative mass, which may be unphysical. However, Cramer et al. argue that such <b>wormholes</b> might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by cosmic string. The general theory of <b>wormholes</b> is discussed by Visser in the book Lorentzian <b>Wormholes.</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that traversible <b>wormholes</b> require {{negative}} energy density. We here argue how much negative energy is needed for <b>wormholes,</b> using a local analysis which does not assume any symmetry. and in particular allows dynamic (non-stationary) but non-degenerate <b>wormholes.</b> We find that <b>wormholes</b> require two constraints on the energy density, given by two independent components of the Einstein equation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the Gauss-Bonnet term on the {{existence}} and dynamical stability of thin-shell <b>wormholes</b> as negative tension branes is studied in the arbitrary dimensional spherically, planar, and hyperbolically symmetric spacetimes. We consider radial perturbations against the shell for the solutions which have the Z${}_ 2 $ symmetry and admit the general relativistic limit. It is shown that the Gauss-Bonnet term shrinks the parameter region admitting static <b>wormholes.</b> The {{effect of the}} Gauss-Bonnet term on the stability depends on the spacetime symmetry. For planar symmetric <b>wormholes,</b> the Gauss-Bonnet term does not affect their stability. If the coupling constant is positive but small, the Gauss-Bonnet term tends to destabilize spherically symmetric <b>wormholes,</b> while it stabilizes hypebolically symmetric <b>wormholes.</b> The Gauss-Bonnet term can destabilize hypebolically symmetric <b>wormholes</b> as a non-perturbative effect, however, spherically symmetric <b>wormholes</b> cannot be stable.

40|$|We {{assume the}} space-time foam picture {{in which the}} vacuum is filled with a gas of virtual <b>wormholes.</b> It is shown that virtual <b>wormholes</b> form a finite (of the Planckian order) value of the energy density of zero-point fluctuations. However such a huge value is {{compensated}} by the contribution of virtual <b>wormholes</b> to the mean curvature and the observed value of the cosmological constant is close to zero. A non-vanishing value appears due to the polarization of vacuum in external classical fields. In the early Universe some virtual <b>wormholes</b> may form actual ones. We show {{that in the case}} of actual <b>wormholes</b> vacuum polarization effects are negligible while their contribution to the mean curvature is apt to form the observed dark energy phenomenon.

5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the <b>wormhole</b> with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the <b>wormhole</b> to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the <b>wormhole</b> to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the <b>wormhole</b> before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E

40|$|We give a {{detailed}} account of the properties of spinning Ellis <b>wormholes,</b> supported by a phantom field. The general set of solutions depends on three parameters, associated with the size of the throat, the rotation and the symmetry of the solutions. For symmetric <b>wormholes</b> the global charges possess the same values in both asymptotic regions, while this is no longer the case for non-symmetric <b>wormholes.</b> We present mass formulae for these <b>wormholes,</b> study their quadrupole moments, and discuss the geometry of their throat and their ergoregion. We demonstrate, that these <b>wormholes</b> possess limiting configurations corresponding to an extremal Kerr black hole.

40|$|The {{statistical}} mechanics {{of a gas}} of Einstein-Kalb-Ramond <b>wormholes</b> is studied in this paper. The <b>wormholes</b> studied {{are the result of}} sewing together two Reissner-Nordstrom-type black hole metrics at their horizons. By requiring the stress-energy tensor associated with this geometry to be that of a Kalb-Ramond field, we obtain the mass and Kalb-Ramond `charge` of the <b>wormholes</b> in terms of the parameters describing the mass density, tension and pressure. We investigate the {{statistical mechanics}} of this system of <b>wormholes</b> {{within the context of the}} statistical bootstrap model.

40|$|We {{investigate}} negative tension branes as stable thin shell <b>wormholes</b> in Reissner-Nordstrom-(anti) de Sitter spacetimes in $d$ dimensional Einstein gravity. Imposing Z 2 symmetry, we {{construct and}} classify traversable static thin shell <b>wormholes</b> in spherical, planar (or cylindrical) and hyperbolic symmetries. In spherical geometry, {{we find the}} higher dimensional counterpart of Barcelo and Visser's <b>wormholes,</b> which are stable against spherically symmetric perturbations. We also find the classes of thin shell <b>wormholes</b> in planar and hyperbolic symmetries with a negative cosmological constant, which are stable against perturbations preserving symmetries. In most cases, stable <b>wormholes</b> are found with the combination of an electric charge and a negative cosmological constant. However, as special cases, we find stable <b>wormholes</b> even with vanishing cosmological constant in spherical symmetry and with vanishing electric charge in hyperbolic symmetry.

In this article we investigate some $f(R,T) $ theoretical predictions for static <b>wormholes,</b> i. e., <b>wormholes</b> whose throat radius can be considered a constant. Since the $T$-dependence in $f(R,T) $ gravity is due to the consideration of quantum effects, a further investigation of <b>wormholes</b> in such a theory is well motivated.
