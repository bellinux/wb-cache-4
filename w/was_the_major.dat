5|$|Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed {{greatly to}} the {{rebuilding}} of the cathedral, {{as evidenced by the}} inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important rebuilding feature <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.|$|E

5|$|Gum-digging <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> {{source of}} income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Bamford Cott, (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987), was a British zoologist, an {{authority}} on both natural and military camouflage, and a scientific illustrator and photographer. Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was especially interested in the Nile crocodile, the evolution of pattern and colour in animals. During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), popular among serving soldiers, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.|$|E

5|$|In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, {{this time}} {{set in the}} upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's {{newspaper}} district; Dunne and other journalists would drink there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was a Republican in a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The World's Columbian Exposition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery {{was used as a}} mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on the events and sights of the fair.
