5|$|On April 1, 2013, reports {{surfaced}} {{that there}} will be a third G.I. Joe film, and it will likely be in 3D. The studio announced that Chu will return to direct the third film. While at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Chu talked about bringing Scarlett back in the next film. The writers of the second film are also thinking about bringing back the Baroness in the sequel. Johnson is interested in returning as Roadblock for the sequel, and Park has talked about a possible return as Snake Eyes and also including his pet wolf Timber. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has stated he is open to doing a G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover, which Chu stated that he would be interested in directing. Bonaventura told Beijing News that he hoped that Johnson and Willis would return, the script is still in the writing stage, and that they are considering adding a third important role. On September 10, 2013, Chu was confirmed to direct the film, along with writer Evan Daugherty (Snow White and the Huntsman, Divergent, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) to pen the film's script. On December 5, 2013, Daugherty talked about writing the film's script and his feelings about Duke being killed, but Chu told MTV that Tatum may return as Duke in the sequel. On April 2, 2014, in an interview with Collider, Johnson believes that Chu may not return to direct, due to working on the live action Jem film, but they may find another director for the film. It was revealed that the third film will have a 2016 release date. On June 23, 2014, di Bonaventura told Collider in an interview that they're meeting with new directors and filming may start in early 2015. On July 1, 2014, Variety reported that Jonathan Lemkin will write the script for the film and will focus on Roadblock with Johnson returning. On February 5, 2015, Film Divider reported that the twins Tomax and Xamot and Matt Trakker from the TV series M.A.S.K. will be appearing. On April 2, 2015, the studio hired Aaron Berg to write the film, and D. J. Caruso to direct the film. On November 23, 2015, Deadline reported that Akiva Goldsman <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>a</b> writers room for the next G.I. Joe film. In September 2016, Byung-Hun Lee told LRM Review that the studio doing the third film is waiting on the actors to return, including Johnson. On January 18, 2017, Caruso has stated to Collider that the script for the crossover movie is now being written. In May 2017, Dwayne Johnson stated that if the opportunity arises he would appear in any future G.I. Joe film, and that he hopes to be a part of the franchise expansion as well. It was announced in September 2017 that the third film is cancelled and a reboot of the franchise will happen.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{persistence}} of metaphysics is connected not only with logical mistakes but also with [...] "social and economical struggles". Metaphysics and theology are allied to traditional social forms, while the {{group of people who}} [...] "faces modern times, rejects these views and takes its stand on the ground of empirical sciences". Thus the struggle between metaphysics and scientific world-conception is not only a struggle between different kinds of philosophies, but it is also—and perhaps primarily—a struggle between different political, social, and economical attitudes. Of course, as the manifesto itself acknowledged, [...] "not every adherent of the scientific world-conception will be a fighter". Many historians of the Vienna Circle see in the latter sentence an implicit reference to a contrast between the so-called 'left wing' of the Vienna Circle, mainly represented by Neurath and Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The aim of the left wing was to facilitate the penetration of the scientific world-conception in [...] "the forms of personal and public life, in education, upbringing, architecture, and the shaping of economic and social life". In contrast, Schlick was primarily interested in the theoretical study of science and philosophy. Perhaps the sentence [...] "Some, glad of solitude, <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>a</b> withdrawn existence on the icy slopes of logic" [...] is an ironic reference to Schlick.|$|E
