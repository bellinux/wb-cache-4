5|$|A further {{variant of}} the hedge hopper idea was devised for St Margaret's Bay where the barrels <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> rolling over the cliff edge.|$|E
5|$|Europeans would sail to the West African {{coast and}} trade African kings {{manufactured}} goods (rifles and ammunition) for slave. From there slaves <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the West Indies or {{the east coast}} of North America to be used for labor. Goods such as cotton, molasses, sugar, tobacco <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> from these places back to Europe. Europe would also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for tea, cloth and spices. The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.|$|E
5|$|Improve water {{deliveries}} to estuaries {{to reduce}} the rapid discharge of excess water to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries that upset nutrient balances and cause lesions on fish. Stormwater discharge <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> instead to reservoirs.|$|E
60|$|LORETTA. If you had let me know, the {{carriage}} <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{another half}} an hour," [...] he said, [...] "my cable <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sent.</b> To-morrow New York <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> indeed {{the city of}} unrest." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{it became}} clear that the banned Rigondeaux <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to Beijing Leon trained harder and beat archrival Toledo and Yurien Fabregas at the {{nationals}} 2008.|$|R
5|$|Under the Tripartite System, {{there were}} to be three types of schools, with pupils sitting an eleven plus exam to {{determine}} which type of school they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to.|$|E
5|$|On campaign, {{following}} {{the assembly of}} the various squadrons at fortified bases (aplēkta) along the coast, the fleet consisted of the main body, composed of the oared warships, and the baggage train (touldon) of sailing vessels and oared transports, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> away {{in the event of}} battle. The battle fleet was divided into squadrons, and orders were transmitted from ship to ship through signal flags (kamelaukia) and lanterns.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} radical {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E
50|$|The site {{launched}} in 2004 as FaxYourMP, allowing users to type a message into the website which <b>would</b> then <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> as a fax to their representative’s office.|$|R
50|$|The 1966 anime {{version of}} Robotan was {{produced}} by Daiko Advertising and the animation was outsourced to four studios, all located in Osaka (which was very uncommon for studios in Tokyo {{to do at the}} time). The studios providing the animation were Puppe Production, A Production, Sun Production, and Nakamura Production, all of which would take turns producing the episodes. All the stories were handled at Daiko Advertising, which <b>would</b> then <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> the four studios. The film <b>would</b> then <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> back to Daiko for editing and dubbing work.|$|R
50|$|Based on the result, the {{government}} adopted conscription {{but with a}} lightness of touch, it at first said that those conscripted <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> overseas to active fighting.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were {{stepping out of the}} bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, metal {{detectors}} were installed {{as a permanent}} fixture to the entrance. The attraction officially had {{metal detectors}}, security with metal detecting wands, and a zero tolerance policy for cell phones, wallets, coins, watches, cameras, {{anything that could be}} placed in one's pockets; all pockets were to be absolutely empty prior to boarding. Persons in violation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the lockers or possibly ejected from the park without a refund.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds for positive identification. The station identification <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E
50|$|The SRB {{distributors}} in the SRBs are cross-strapped together. Thus, if one SRB {{received an}} arm or destruct signal, the signal <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> {{to the other}} SRB.|$|R
60|$|Longstreet's corps <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> away {{to bring}} an equal force back upon the same road; {{and there is no}} other {{direction}} for them to have come from.|$|R
25|$|With the {{knowledge}} that rescue ships <b>would</b> <b>be</b> eventually <b>sent</b> to them, the expedition remained hopeful, though expedition leaders struggled {{to keep them in}} high spirits.|$|R
5|$|Initially it {{had been}} planned that the Australians <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the United Kingdom, where they would {{undertake}} further training prior to {{being sent to the}} Western Front in France and Belgium. However, the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on Germany's side on 29 October meant that the strategically vital Suez Canal was threatened, {{and as a result of}} this and overcrowding in training grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the convoy reaching the Suez at the end of November, plans for the use of the Australian force were changed and they were disembarked in Egypt instead.|$|E
5|$|On October25, Premier Tran Thien Khiem toured {{some of the}} storm-ravaged {{areas and}} made on-the-spot grants of $19,000 to each {{province}} and $3,500 to Đà Nẵng. He also promised that 50,000sheets of tin roofing <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to aid in reconstruction. Later that day, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered $725,000 be made available for disaster relief in the northern provinces following an emergency meeting. The Social Welfare Ministry estimated that $1.5million would be needed for civilian relief.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{trials for}} Petropavlovsk were {{scheduled}} to begin sometime in late 1941, {{and according to the}} training program, the Soviet crew would not begin training until a month before the trials. It was decided that Soviet officers would train at German naval schools in the Fall of 1941, and that five officers would train aboard Seydlitz when the ship was commissioned for trials. German instructors would also be sent to Leningrad to train engine-room personnel. At the time of the commissioning of Petropavlovsk, the relevant German training and technical manuals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the Soviet Navy, albeit in German only.|$|E
5000|$|The {{numerous}} foreign mercenaries <b>would</b> <b>be</b> demobilised and <b>sent</b> home.|$|R
50|$|The Foreign Secretary {{announced}} that a British Military Liaison Advisory Team <b>would</b> to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to Benghazi to advise the NTC {{on how to improve}} their military organisational structures, communications and logistics.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally a {{negative}} cutter would then fine cut the negative {{to match the}} Editor's final edit frame accurately. Negative <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spliced together to create rolls less than 2000 ft which <b>would</b> then <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the film laboratory to print release prints.|$|R
5|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were designed by Bob Thomas, whereas the code was written by Dave Thomas. The Thomas brothers decided to show their progress {{of the game}} to Tim and Chris Stamper for evaluation, despite feeling embarrassed due to their workspace being inside their parents' attic. Impressed by the game, the Stamper brothers commissioned an entire series to be released for the Commodore 64. Dave Thomas recalled that every game they produced was met with little interference from Ultimate; once a game was complete, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to quality assessment and subsequently published for release.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of air}} {{transport}} meant that the division's two available brigades had to be transported by sea. They would cross the Mediterranean in four Royal Navy cruisers with their escorts. If the landing was successful, the British 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, {{under the command of}} British V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Walter Allfrey, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to reinforce the landings.|$|E
5|$|They were {{captured}} by the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the NK 105th Armored Division. The North Korean troops marched their prisoners down the hill after taking their weapons and valuables. In a nearby orchard, they tied the prisoners' hands behind their backs, took some of their clothing and removed their shoes. They told the American POWs that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the prisoner-of-war camp in Seoul if they behaved well.|$|E
50|$|K.O.: Real {{felt that}} she still had growing up to do, and had even stated that if she hadnt {{walked out of the}} house earlier, Bay Bay Bay <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they <b>would</b> {{naturally}} <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> home to recuperate. It's {{the usual}} thing {{out there to}} turn elephants loose in the hills, just as we put horses out to grass in this country." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{six hours}} of fighting, the 21st Ohio, {{numbering}} about 540 men, lost 265 killed, wounded or captured. 46 men <b>would</b> eventually <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to Andersonville prison. Only ten of the prisoners would survive.|$|R
5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the Levée en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1808, {{messages}} arrived in France from Martinique, outlining the desperate situation of their supplies, morale and economy. It was determined that reinforcements and food supplies <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> and the frigate Thétis was despatched in November 1808. Within days, Thétis had been captured at the Action of 10 November 1808, and subsequent operations had mixed success: the frigate Amphitrite reached Martinique, {{but a number of}} smaller ships were intercepted and defeated, both in Europe and the West Indies. In desperation, a major operation was planned, intended to transport substantial supplies and sufficient troops to resist the inevitable British invasion on Martinique. To this end, Commodore Amable-Gilles Troude was provided with the ships of the line Courageux, Polonais and Hautpoult, with the frigates Félicité and Furieuse en flûte as armed storeships, carrying the bulk of the supplies.|$|E
5|$|During this time, rumors swirled {{that the}} Regiment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to live combat, while {{officers}} {{had already been}} moved to act as observers. On 22 September 1944, the 65th Infantry landed in France. The Regiment was then moved to Peira Cava in the Maritime Alps, where it entered in action on December 13, 1944, {{the first time a}} Puerto Rican unit saw action in Europe. The first offensive attack came the following day in response to enemy fire, with Col. Cordero allowing Capt. Efraín Sánchez and Company L to return fire. The first casualty lost by the Regiment were Sgt. Ángel Martínez and Sergio Sánchez. In total, in the border between France and Italy, the battalion lost 47 men, including its commander, Col. George Ford.|$|E
5000|$|The dam was to {{be located}} 20 mi {{northeast}} of Edson, Alberta, near the hamlet of Peers, Alberta. The diverted water <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> via a canal to Chip Lake. The report read: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I re'lly did hope," [...] said Mrs. Kittridge, mournfully, [...] "that this 'ere solemn Providence <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> {{home to the}} Cap'n's mind; but {{he seems}} jist as light and triflin' as ever." ...|$|R
25|$|After Prince Henry's younger brother, the Duke of Kent, {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} in August 1942, it was decided that the Duke of Gloucester <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> on any further {{missions}} that could prove dangerous.|$|R
