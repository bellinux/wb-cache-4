5|$|Amy Dumas {{was born}} in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 14, 1975. She {{attended}} many different schools throughout her childhood and adolescent years and managed to finish high school at Lassiter High School six months before graduation. She majored in education at Georgia State University, but dropped out in 1993 because she felt it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like high school.|$|E
5|$|At {{the battle}} itself, Johnson's forces {{were the first}} to attack. One {{battalion}} of five hundred men, under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. There <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; three quarters of the regulars were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} felt <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} {{retiring from}} professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He {{had a change of}} heart and returned to the Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his knee and dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|The assassinations of Aurelian and Probus {{demonstrated}} that sole rulership was {{dangerous to the}} stability of the empire. Conflict boiled in every province, from Gaul to Syria, Egypt to the lower Danube. It <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for one person to control, and Diocletian needed a lieutenant. At some time in 285 at Mediolanum (Milan), Diocletian raised his fellow-officer Maximian to the office of caesar, making him co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E

5|$|Before {{releasing}} the film, Madonna invited {{a group of}} friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. General consensus was that there <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided to prune those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E
5|$|In August 1849 the MCS {{appointed}} Joseph Bazalgette to {{the position}} of assistant surveyor. He had been working as a consultant engineer in the railway industry until overwork had brought about a serious breakdown in his health; his appointment to the commission was his first position on his return to employment. Working under the chief engineer, Frank Foster, he began to develop a more systematic plan for the city's sewers. The stress of his position <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Foster and he died in 1852; Bazalgette was promoted into his position, and continued refining and developing the plans {{for the development of the}} sewerage system. The Metropolis Management Act 1855 replaced the commission with the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), which took control of the sewers.|$|E
5|$|In Falls the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning. As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, {{as opposed to the}} more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, {{as shown in the}} finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E
5|$|Rembrandt was foaled in 1977 by Herbert de Baey. His sire was Romadour II, {{a famous}} Westphalian {{stallion}} during the 1970s, and his dam was Adone, full sister to Ahlerich, a multiple Olympic medal winning dressage horse under German rider Reiner Klimke. Due to his Thoroughbred-like appearance, several riders passed over {{a chance to}} purchase the gelding as a youngster. In 1981, he was purchased by Nicole Uphoff's father, Jürgen Uphoff, as a mount for his then-14-year-old daughter. Rembrandt <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her, however, and {{he was sent to}} train with Klaus Balkenhol, a noted trainer who saw his potential and advised the Uphoffs to keep the horse, despite his spookiness and sensitivity.|$|E

5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00, there <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{water in}} the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, {{almost all of the}} compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a winning}} record, {{injuries}} hobbled {{the team for}} the 2009–2010 season. Reserves Batum and Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Most notably, centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan was likewise not spared, suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice and was in a walking boot. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Although wins did not come as easily as the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and finished 6th in the West. Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee, but returned for Game 4 {{of the first round}} series against the Phoenix Suns. However, the accumulation of injuries <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to bear, and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{crossed the}} Dutch {{frontier}} on 16 February 1793. The fortress of Breda fell {{after a quick}} siege from 21 to 24 February 1793. The 3,000 Dutch defenders, which included 2,500 infantry and a dragoon regiment, surrendered the city with its 250 cannon and were allowed to go free. Also on the 21st, Maastricht was invested by 10,000 troops of Miranda's army. There were 8,000 Austrian and Dutch defenders under Prince Karl Wilhelm Georg of Hesse-Darmstadt, an Austrian General-major. The siege work at Maastricht in winter weather <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the French volunteers and many deserted their units and went home. The fortress of Geertruidenberg with 150 guns capitulated after a siege from 1 to 4 March. The Dutch garrison of two battalions and two squadrons were allowed to go free. Both Breda and Geertruidenberg had been bluffed into giving up by the military engineer Jean Claude le Michaud d'Arcon, who had designed the floating batteries at the Great Siege of Gibraltar. A small fort at Klundert was captured on 4 March by 4,000 men under Berneron. The tiny garrison put up a stiff fight and lost 60 killed before the 73 survivors gave up.|$|E
5|$|In January 1629, Charles {{opened the}} second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a {{moderate}} speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies {{in light of the}} case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. The provocation <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, thereby turning the men into martyrs, and giving popular cause to their protest.|$|E
