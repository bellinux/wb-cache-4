5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E

Blaine responds by having the Warblers <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sexified" [...] performance of [...] "Animal", with Kurt joining him on lead, but Kurt's [...] "sexy" [...] faces and moves are anything but. Kurt insists on remaining ignorant of sexual matters, which Blaine feels is dangerous at their age, so he visits Kurt's father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), and prompts him to give Kurt [...] "the talk" [...] about sex.|$|E
500|$|The Viola Concerto (1929) brought Walton to the {{forefront}} of British classical music. It was written at the suggestion of Sir Thomas Beecham for the viola virtuoso Lionel Tertis. When Tertis received the manuscript, he rejected it immediately. The composer and violist Paul Hindemith stepped into the breach and gave the first performance. The work was greeted with enthusiasm. In The Manchester Guardian, Eric Blom wrote, [...] "This young composer is a born genius" [...] and said that it was tempting to call the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality. Tertis soon changed his mind and took the <b>work</b> <b>up.</b> <b>A</b> performance by him at a Three Choirs Festival concert in Worcester in 1932 was the only occasion on which Walton met Elgar, whom he greatly admired. Elgar did not share the general enthusiasm for Walton's concerto.|$|E

500|$|The title track, [...] "Enamorada de Ti", {{received}} a favorable review from Guerra, {{who believed that}} its merengue version [...] "manages to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> considerable sweat". Calling it a [...] "tropical rhythm", Banda noted {{that it is the}} earliest-recorded track on the album. Lopetegui considered it [...] "crowd-pleasing". Lovelace thought it [...] "enjoyable", saying that the merengue mix version [...] "adds a lively, tropical tone to the original slow tempo love song", but he added that it [...] "seems awkwardly paired when it comes to collaborating artists, who often clash with Selena's voice and the overall sound". Of the acoustic bonus tracks, Guerra wrote that they are [...] "unlikely highlights, the new instrumentation gives them all a nice edge and highlights Selena's burgeoning vocal prowess". Banda was more positive, listing them as recommended tracks that he found to be reminiscent of live Selena recordings.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, playing the titular role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even {{wrote a letter to}} {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] From the moment she was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song... I think on her mind, {{the best way to do}} it was go in the studio and <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> remix".|$|E

Coon told Gerrold to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> further pitch. This version of the story added the Klingons, and moved the action from planetside to a space station. During a visit to the set, Gerrold had the opportunity to speak to Leonard Nimoy and ask his advice on how to write for Spock and was allowed to watch the dailies from each day's shoot of the episode [...] "" [...] which was being filmed at the time. This version of the story was entitled [...] "A Fuzzy Thing Happened to Me...", which was purchased by Coon as a plot outline. He offered Gerrold a chance to write the script himself, by promising not to hand it to another writer for a month. However, Coon {{made it clear that he}} was not offering Gerrold a script assignment, but was giving him the option of submitting a draft.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. PopMatters {{described it as}} [...] "dripping with sexual energy and cool" [...] and is [...] "sexy as hell, but contains a pretty unmistakable edge of hostility, macho swagger, and thunderous chest thumping." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote {{that it was an}} [...] "appealing throwaway single" [...] and lyrics such as [...] "after you <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> sweat, you can play with the stick" [...] are not seductions; [...] "they're orders". MusicOMH wrote that the chemistry between 50 Cent and Olivia [...] "is almost as explicit as the lyrics ... the bass line is made for grinding to". Author Ethan Brown, in a review of The Massacre, called the track [...] "uninspiring" [...] and [...] "nearly identical" [...] to his previous collaboration with Lil' Kim on [...] "Magic Stick". He stated that 50 Cent seemed too content with his [...] "hypersexual image" [...] among other things and [...] "not inspired enough to work beyond the same old attention-getting schemes." [...] Pitchfork Media listed [...] "Candy Shop" [...] as a reprise of [...] "Magic Stick" [...] both [...] "in beats and in timbre", and Stylus magazine said it was [...] "more of the same" [...] as his previous collaboration. Billboard wrote that 50 Cent [...] "shows little growth lyrically" [...] with the song being [...] "typical playa-friendly fodder". The song was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song, but lost to Kanye West's [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone".|$|E
500|$|On 8 January 1941, Rear Admiral Bruce Fraser, Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy {{asked the}} DNC to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hybrid {{aircraft}} carrier {{based on the}} Lion-class hull. Two months later, a sketch design was presented for consideration, {{but it was not}} well liked by the participants. This design retained all three main gun turrets and the flight deck was deemed too short to be useful. A revised version with only the two forward turrets retained was requested and was ready in July. In this design, the displacement ranged from [...] at standard load and [...] at deep load. The design's dimensions included a waterline length of , a beam of [...] and a draught of [...] The flight deck was [...] long and had a width of [...] The machinery was unchanged, but [...] of additional oil increased her endurance to [...] at 10 knots. The hybrid's armament consisted of six 16-inch guns in two triple turrets, sixteen 5.25-inch guns and eight octuple 2-pounder mounts. Twelve fighters and two torpedo bombers could be carried. The Director of Naval Gunnery was particularly pungent in his assessment of the design, [...] "The functions and requirements of carriers and of surface gun platforms are entirely incompatible ...the conceptions of these designs ...is evidently the result of an unresolved contest between a conscious acceptance of aircraft and a subconscious desire for a 1914 Fleet ...these abortions are the results of a psychological maladjustment. The necessary readjustments should result from a proper re-analysis of the whole question, what would be a balanced fleet in 1945, 1950 or 1955?" [...] Not surprisingly, the design was rejected.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} solo singer {{alternating}} with a chorus is extended in the following movement, the bass aria with chorus [...] (Peace be with you). A string introduction depicts in agitated forte passages in 4/4 time the attack of the enemies. John Eliot Gardiner describes it as [...] "a dramatic scena in which the strings <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> storm to illustrate the raging of the soul's enemies". In sharp contrast the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings the greeting of Jesus from verse 19 of the Gospel, [...] "Peace be with you", three times, accompanied by woodwinds in dotted rhythm in 3/4 time, marked piano. Musicologist Julian Mincham describes the music as serene, a [...] "gentle, rocking, almost cradle-like rhythm creating a perfect atmosphere of peaceful contemplation". The upper voices of the choir (without basses) answer {{to the music of}} the introduction, seeing Jesus as help in the battle (""). The greeting and answering is repeated two more times in two stanzas of the poem, reflecting the strengthening of the weary in spirit and body (""), and finally overcoming death (""). The following fourth appearance of [...] "Peace be with you" [...] is accompanied by both woodwinds and strings, and peace is finally achieved. Klaus Hofmann describes the movement as an [...] "operatic scene" [...] and continues [...] "Bach resorts to unconventional means; he shows himself as a musical dramatist and, in the process, stresses the element of contrast: he comments upon the words of the faithful with agitated, tumultuous string figures, whilst Jesus' peace greeting sounds calmly and majestically, embedded in pastoral wind sonorities." [...] Bach adapted this movement as the Gloria of his Missa in A major, BWV 234.|$|E

2500|$|The {{thickness}} or {{weight of}} the yarn is {{a significant factor in}} determining the gauge, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern. [...] Thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks. [...] Hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> given project. [...] Patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate patternwork. [...] Yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky. Quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (WPI). [...] The related weight per unit length [...] is usually measured in tex or denier.|$|E

However, Lanois would [...] "cover for him" [...] such that the two balanced each other out. Much of the album was later recast in Windmill Lane Studios, where they recorded from 6 June to 5 August. For the first time on a U2 album, a synthesizer was used; a Fairlight CMI was used to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> number of songs, the textures of which were later filled out with strings and other orchestration. At Windmill Lane, tension grew between the production team and the band, largely because the band [...] "couldn't finish anything". Twelve days before the official finishing date, Bono said he could not finish the lyrics, and the band worked 20-hour days for the final two weeks. Bono later said he felt songs like [...] "Bad" [...] and [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] were left as incomplete [...] "sketches".|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain {{appointed}} a new High Commissioner for South Africa in May 1897.

[...] Milner was a dedicated proponent of British Imperialism and of the ‘forward’ policy; viewing it {{as the only way}} to preserve what he saw as Britain’s waning regional influence. [...] February 1898 saw Kruger re-elected for his fourth term, with a substantial majority over his reformist rivals. [...] Milner took this as a sign that {{there was no time to}} lose; if there was any further waiting the result would be Afrikaner dominance to the exclusion of Britain, orchestrated from a powerful Transvaal. [...] Milner returned to London in November 1898 for consultations with Chamberlain. [...] Having observed the situation for the past eighteen months, he was now sure of his strategy. [...] Milner proposed that the British government should <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> crisis, giving them a legitimate pretext to intervene, a pretext that would place Britain in the right and the Transvaal in the wrong in the court of public opinion. [...] Chamberlain re-iterated his instruction to Milner that the British government could not be seen to be coercing Kruger; any intervention must be as a result of the Transvaal putting itself in the wrong. [...] Milner returned to South Africa a satisfied man; while the British government would not act, Chamberlain had not tied the hands of officials in South Africa. [...] Milner was determined to be the one to force this pretext.|$|E
