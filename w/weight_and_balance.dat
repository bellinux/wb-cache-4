25|$|Testing {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} problems, notably a lack of horizontal stability, an underpowered trim system, landing gear {{that could only be}} extended at slow speeds, an unreliable airspeed indicator, and a cramped cockpit. The test pilots also requested that six guns be installed. The stability problem was addressed on the second prototype by adding a triangular fillet {{to the front of the}} vertical stabilizer.

25|$|In the 1960s Bernard Pietenpol {{began to}} favor {{converted}} engines from Chevrolet Corvair automobiles. The Corvair engine was smoother, stronger and significantly lighter in weight {{compared to the}} Model A, as the Corvair automobiles used air-cooled, flat-six configuration engines, similar in design to those already available (in generally larger displacements) for general aviation use. The length of a Pietenpol varies with the engine choices, as engines that are lighter than the Fords need to be mounted further out from the firewall for <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> reasons. Over the years over 30 different engines have flown in the Pietenpol Air Camper. Many modern Pietenpol builders prefer Continental A65, C85 or C90 air-cooled flat four powerplants. Several examples of the Aircamper have been built in Europe and are currently (2012) flying.|$|E
25|$|In putting {{together}} the curriculum for training pilots and copilots on the B-29 Superfortress, Training Command could make use of its experience in transition training for heavy bombers. No such experience was available {{in the case of}} flight engineers, because the B-29 was the first AAF aircraft that required a flight engineer. This individual operated the engine control panel of the aircraft. Located behind the pilot, the panel contained all operating instruments but those the pilot used to control the altitude and direction of the B-29. At the direction of the pilot, the flight engineer used these instruments to adjust the throttles, fuel mixture, supercharger, and propeller pitch. He also computed the aircraft's cruising range, fuel consumption, engine performance, <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance,</b> and airworthiness. Flight engineers underwent comprehensive training at Amarillo and Lowry Fields before assignment to B-29 transition training.|$|E

[...] In response, the Operations Manager for MacRobertson Miller Aviation sent specific instructions to pilots on 30 June. [...] On 1 July, the day before the accident, the Operations Manager discussed his instructions with the pilots of the accident flight. Staff involved with the loading of aircraft were instructed to use the method of Index Units to check that the centre of gravity of an aircraft was within limits. [...] The employee who loaded the freight and passengers' luggage on the accident flight told the inquiry that after the freight was loaded, a check of the aircraft <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> showed that about [...] of freight should be removed. [...] Freight weighing [...] was then removed. [...] However, this employee believed the Load Sheet column labelled Index Units was not completed.|$|E

2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} pilot in command (PIC) allowing the aircraft to be loaded beyond its operating limitations. The required pre-flight <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> computations would have shown it was dangerously overloaded and also outside its <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> operating envelope, but in this instance the pilot in command, as a former military pilot, was neither accustomed to nor responsible for computing <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> computations during his military career, as this was the responsibility of the military loadmaster, and thus it is believed he may have by force of habit overlooked this responsibility as a civilian pilot is required to do. Don Alan Burmeister was a former United States Marine Corps aviator, but FAA records show he had very limited experience / training in flying conventional (vs. centerline thrust) twin engine aircraft. [...] Records show it was only a short time prior to the accident (6/9/82) that he completed a check-ride to remove the [...] "centerline thrust" [...] restriction from his pilot's certificate. This check-ride should have fully evaluated his ability to fly a conventional multi-engine aircraft throughout its designed range of operations, but the flight examiner was decertified the next month (7/10/82) by the FAA due to a [...] "history of incomplete or substandard check-rides". Additionally, the insurance carrier (Ideal Mutual Insurance Co.) required Burmeister to log 1,045 hrs of flying time, attend a Cessna ground and flight training course, as well as log 15 hours in a Cessna 414 (C-414) prior to acting as the PIC of the leased aircraft. The NTSB record shows he failed to accomplish all of these requirements, with disastrous results. With pilot and eleven passengers, the aircraft was overloaded by an estimated , and the location of the center of gravity was found to be [...] beyond the maximum aft limit. Combined with an air temperature of , creating a condition known as [...] "hot and high" [...] (high density altitude, producing a lower climb rate on takeoff and greater danger of stalling), the C-414 could do little but struggle into the air within ground effect, and once airborne was left virtually uncontrollable. These factors prevented the aircraft from ever attaining sufficient altitude, and it crashed into trees {{less than a mile from}} the airport.|$|E

Unlike on the {{original design}}, roll control was changed to ailerons, with upper surface spoilers paired with lower surface dive brakes for glidepath control.

To simplify <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> considerations the monowheel landing gear is located on the desired C of G and the pilot's seat is adjustable fore-and-aft.
