The Steelers defeated their division rival, the Baltimore Ravens, 27-10 in the AFC Divisional round at Heinz Field. The following week {{they went on to}} face the second seeded New England Patriots. Bell recorded 8 tackles, a sack, and 2 passes defended. Despite his stellar performance, and a late 4th quarter comeback, the Steelers wound up losing the game 24-17. In 2002, Bell was injured in week 1 of the AFC Championship Game rematch versus New England. He missed the next 4 games, but returned in week 7 to face the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night. He finished the season with 50 tackles, (33 less from his rookie year), and 4 sacks. The Steelers finished with a 10-5-1 record, and went on to face the Cleveland Browns. In an epic 36-33 comeback win over the Browns, Bell recorded 9 tackles but injured his knee in the final quarter and was listed as doubtful for the following week at Tennessee. Although hurt, Bell started the game against the second seeded Titans. He recorded only 2 tackles before leaving the game once again with an injury. The Steelers lost 34-31 in a controversial finish. In 2003, Bell amassed 99 tackles and 5 sacks despite the Steelers poor 6-10 finish. In 2004, Bell injured his knee yet again, and would not see the field until week 9. He played 3 games for the Steelers before he re-injured his knee in week 11 versus Cincinnati. In the 2005 off-season, the Steelers, (who went 15-1 in the regular season without Bell), released him from the team.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: {{procrastination}} {{refers to}} the delay or postponement of task or decision-making initiation or completion and is often conceptualised as a failure of self-regulation. Recent {{research has suggested that}} metacognitions play a role in procrastination and that unintentional procrastination (UP), as opposed to intentional procrastination (IP), may be the most problematic form of this behaviour. We aimed to test a metacognitive model of procrastination that was grounded in the Self-Regulatory Executive Function model. METHODS: a convenience sample of 400 participants were recruited and completed (at least partially) a battery of online questionnaires that measured IP and UP, metacognitions about procrastination, depression, and Cognitive Attentional Syndrome (CAS) configurations. Initially, we tested series of hypotheses to establish the relationships between the experimental variables and to test whether CAS configurations would independently predict UP when controlling for age, depression, IP, metacognitions about procrastination, and whether an individual reported that they had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. RESULTS: CAS configurations, depression, and metacognitions independently predicted UP. Additionally, path analysis revealed that the study data <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to the proposed metacognitive model of procrastination. LIMITATIONS: the study is cross-sectional.

40|$|The {{thin film}} {{pressure}} balance (TFPB) technique {{was used to}} study the kinetics of film thinning {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The experimental results were compared with the predictions of the Reynolds equation. During the initial stages, the film thinning was controlled by the capillary pressure. As the film thickness is reduced, the process is controlled by surface forces. The thickness at which the surface forces begin to control the film thinning process vanes with the surfactant and electrolyte concentrations. At low surfactant and electrolyte concentrations, there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> between the film thinning experiment and the Reynolds equation corrected for the contributions from the hydrophobic forces to the disjoining pressure. In the present work, the magnitudes of the hydrophobic forces were determined from the equilibrium film thicknesses using the TFPB technique. At low surfactant and high electrolyte concentrations, where it was difficult to determine the equilibrium film thicknesses, contributions from the hydrophobic forces were determined by fitting the film thinning data to the Reynolds equation. The hydrophobic forces determined in the present work decreased with increasing SDS and NaCl concentrations. It may, thus, be the role of surfactant and electrolyte to dampen the hydrophobic force and thereby to retard the film thinning process. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the relationships between}} teacher characteristics and the academic achievement of {{students with and without}} Learning Disabilities (LD) in a path model. Teacher-related variables included teacher self-efficacy, expectations of students ’ educational attainment, level of education and years of experience. Data were drawn from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth and participants included students in grades one through six who were taught by a single teacher (N = 2367). Results indicated that the hypothesized path model <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to the data. Furthermore, academic achievement was significantly impacted by teacher expectations, LD status, and teacher efficacy. Teachers felt less confident in their ability to instruct students with LD, had lower expectations of their long-term success and also rated their achievement more poorly. The findings are discussed within existing research and implications for teacher preparation and in-service training programs are presented. Students with Learning Disabilities (LD) are now increasingly included in regular, or inclusive classrooms across North America (Data Accountability Center, 2009 a). These students are typically taught by teachers who have varied training and expertise with respect to including students with exceptionalities in their classes (Booth, Nes & Stromstad, 2003).

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the factor {{structure}} of the Chinese General Self-Efficacy Scale and gender invariance in the structure. Background. The General Self-Efficacy Scale was developed in 1981 and revised in 1995 to measure people's beliefs or expectations about their ability to perform tasks on their own across a wide range of demanding/novel situations. While the Chinese version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale has been examined for adolescents and adults from clinical populations, its psychometric properties for community-dwelling Chinese soon-to-be-aged adults, who are in a transitional stage from adulthood to later life, have not been tested. Females have consistently reported a lower general self-efficacy level than males, but it is unclear whether the difference is a result of response bias of the inventory by gender. Method. A convenience sample of Chinese soon-to-be-aged adults (n= 695) in 28 non-government organizations in Hong Kong completed the survey from March to May 2005. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the factor structure and multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis to test the gender invariance of the Chinese version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Results. The proposed factor structure of the Chinese version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to the overall data, and held equally well for both males and females, both genders demonstrating an equivalent pattern of factor loadings. The Cronbach alpha value was high (0 · 89). Conclusion. The Chinese version of the General Self-Efficacy is a reliable and valid scale and both genders responded to it using the same framework and metric, thus allowing it to be used with confidence in non-clinical Chinese soon-to-be-aged adult samples. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|We have reanalysed {{constraints}} on the equation of state parameter, w_Q = P/rho, of the dark energy, using several cosmological data sets and relaxing the usual constraint w_Q > - 1. We find that combining Cosmic Microwave Background, large scale structure and Type Ia supernova data yields a non-trivial lower bound on w_Q. At 95. 4 % confidence we find, assuming a flat geometry of the universe, a bound of - 2. 68 - 1 does not significantly bias the overall allowed region for w_Q. When this constraint is imposed the 95. 4 % confidence bound is - 1 < w_Q < - 0. 71. Also, a pure cosmological constant (w = - 1) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to all available data. Based on simulations of future data from the Planck CMB experiment and the SNAP and SNfactory supernova experiments we estimate {{that it will be}} possible to constrain w_Q at the 5 % level in the future...|$|R
40|$|Linearly {{coasting}} cosmology is comfortably concordant {{with a host}} of cosmological observations. It <b>is</b> surprisingly <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to SNe Ia {{observations and}} constraints arising from age of old quasars. In this article we highlight the overall viability of an open linear coasting cosmological model. The model is consistent with the latest SNe Ia ``gold'' sample and accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the standard cold-dark model fails to do. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
