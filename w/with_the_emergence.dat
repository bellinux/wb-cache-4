With Weber and Suter {{providing}} most of the offence from the blueline, Hamhuis was used primarily as a shutdown defenceman, matching up against opposing team's top forward units and leading the club in shorthanded ice time, while seeing limited powerplay time.|$|E
5|$|Television and {{newspapers}} take {{an important role}} in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take a part. For a long time, newspapers were regarded as the most influential information medium in Japan, although audience attitudes towards television changed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of commercial news broadcasting in the mid-1980s. Over the last decade, television has clearly come to surpass newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium.|$|E

5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century.

5|$|Bell: Clapper-bells made {{of pottery}} {{have been found}} in several archaeological sites. The {{earliest}} metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. Early bells not only have an important role in generating metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of other kinds of bells during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.|$|E
5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of the Solidarity mass movement.

With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority {{did not want to}} impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary also persuaded {{an active}} expansionist {{policy in the}} Balkan Peninsula {{from the end of}} the 12th century. To that end, Oltenia was put under the control of a Hungarian governor, who received the title of ban. The centre of the new province (the Banate of Severin) was Fort Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania), on the Danube, in the vicinity of the Iron Gates. Its first ban, Luke, was mentioned in 1233.|$|E

The Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned to first base.|$|E

5|$|The {{intermittent}} Roman {{presence in}} Scotland coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of the Picts, a confederation of tribes who lived {{to the north}} of the Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century.

They are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their monumental stones. The Gaels of Dalriada called the Picts Cruithne, and Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.|$|E

The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the lure of filmmaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more money than he was making writing for The New Yorker.|$|E
