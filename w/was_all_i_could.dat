500|$|In the 1934 NFL Championship Game, the Giants {{defeated}} previously unbeaten Chicago 30–13 at the Polo Grounds on an icy {{field with}} temperatures peaking at 25 degrees. Before the game, team treasurer John Mara talked with Owen and team captain Flaherty about the field conditions. Flaherty suggested the Giants wear sneakers {{on the frozen}} field, as he had played in a game under similar circumstances at Gonzaga, and the sneakers proved to be effective. Mara dispatched equipment manager Abe Cohen {{to get as many}} sneakers as he could get. Due to traffic and the inability to find any athletic goods stores open on Sunday, Cohen was unable to return before the game started, and the Giants, wearing conventional footwear, trailed 10–3 {{at the end of the}} first half. Realizing time was short, Cohen went to Manhattan College — where he had a key to the equipment and locker rooms — and returned to the Polo Grounds at halftime with nine pairs of basketball sneakers, saying that [...] "nine pairs <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get." [...] Players donned the sneakers and New York, after allowing Chicago another field goal late in the 3rd quarter, responded with 27 unanswered points in the 4th quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. The game would come to be known as [...] "The Sneakers Game", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the 4th quarter set a single–quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades. After the game, offensive tackle Len Grant expressed his sincere gratitude by stating [...] "God bless Abe Cohen." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{they signed}} McBride, {{who had spent}} the 1934 season playing on a semi-pro team, before the game, the Western Division {{champion}} Bears were still 2½–1 favorites. The Giants defeated the previously unbeaten Bears, however, 30–13 at the Polo Grounds on an icy field with temperatures peaking at 25degrees. Before the game, team treasurer John Mara talked with Owen and captain Ray Flaherty about the frozen field conditions. Flaherty suggested the Giants wear sneakers on the frozen field, as he had played in a game under similar circumstances at Gonzaga and the sneakers proved to be effective. Mara dispatched equipment manager Abe Cohen {{to get as many}} sneakers as he could get. Due to traffic and the inability to find any athletic goods stores open on Sunday, Cohen was unable to return before the game started and New York, wearing conventional footwear, trailed 10–3 {{at the end of the}} first half. Realizing time was short, Cohen went to Manhattan College—where he had a key to the equipment and locker rooms—and returned to the Polo Grounds at halftime with nine pairs of basketball sneakers, saying that [...] "nine pairs <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get." [...] Players donned the sneakers and the Giants, after allowing the Bears another field goal late in the third period, responded with 27 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. When they took the lead 17–13 on a touchdown run by Strong, the game had to be stopped because hundreds of fans ran onto the field to celebrate. The game would come to be known as [...] "The Sneakers Game", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the fourth quarter set a single-quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades. Fans converged on the field after the game, tearing down one of the goal posts. After the game offensive tackle Len Grant expressed his gratitude, saying [...] "God bless Abe Cohen." [...] Oddly, the team's performance was also aided by the consumption of alcohol. The team's trainer felt that whiskey could warm the players up, and he put some into their paper cups. Strong scored a touchdown on the next play, and the trainer did the same thing on the next drive, which again ended in a touchdown. Fearing drunkenness, water was returned to their cups once the team had the lead,.|$|E

60|$|Those wild words <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{say before}} the misery and madness in me forced their way outward {{in a burst}} of sobs and tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon you can coax {{it out of}} Roy. Fact <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn <b>was</b> thet Roy come in {{the saloon}} alone. Beasley was there, an' Riggs--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly, sir; {{my purpose}} is known and {{approved}} by more than one," [...] said I. [...] "And your letter, which I take a pleasure to thank you for, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have hoped." ...|$|R
60|$|Tho. Nay, I don't know, {{but in a}} fright it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do.|$|E
60|$|I nodded my head again. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to {{keep myself}} {{standing}} upright.|$|E
60|$|PARAMORE (utterly {{contemptuous of}} Craven's narrow {{personal}} {{view of the}} matter). Yes. That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get a license for.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear, you <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ask," [...] and Mrs. Shaw {{looked up}} at him with such affection and {{confidence}} in her eyes, that Polly gave Tom the first approving look she had vouchsafed him since she came.|$|R
6000|$|... "These <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hire to-day, sir," [...] the man said. [...] "They are {{too much}} frightened {{to come out}} of their houses. To-morrow we shall get plenty of men. The consul told me to go with you as interpreter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{brought you}} {{something}} to eat, Granny," [...] he panted, as he laid the fish at her feet. He was quite out of breath with running. [...] "It isn't much, but it is something. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find for you." ...|$|R
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from crying.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do to keep}} a {{straight}} face. I'd {{a pretty good idea}} where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|E
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Emily, my child," [...] she whispered, {{pressing}} her affectionately to her bosom, [...] "you have <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish, {{and more than}} I expected, under your arduous struggles. But one more pang, and I trust your recollections on this painful subject will be done away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If that <b>were</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{suit you}} there, my lad," [...] muttered the stranger. He {{continued}} aloud, [...] "Well, {{what is your}} will with me? D----d ungenteel treatment this! But put your questions; and, to oblige you, I may answer them,--if so be that I know anything of the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do," [...] said Carton. [...] "To propose too much, {{would be}} to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was {{obviously}} {{the weakness of the}} position. There is no help for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Every day I gazed on {{the lovely}} fruit, which became {{gradually}} {{more and more}} tempting-looking, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do not to break the magician's commands.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{that last}} {{manoeuvre}} of yours," [...] he said, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do to prevent}} him from rushing over to Jerry Shorter's--and signing the lease." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do to keep}} awake, but I {{managed to}} do so {{with the aid of}} an early morning paper I bought on the train.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was on my}} tongue's end to {{tell him}} that all the fun we'd be likely to have that night would be what we might get out of seeing poor Bobby killed; but I thought we'd soon be having trouble enough without my trying to stir up any more just then, so I said, talking as if it <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from crying: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{said about}} four hundred {{thousand}} dollars a month, and board, <b>was</b> about <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reasonably ask, considering the hard times.|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ask of your Majesty," [...] said Cicely. [...] "The next {{messenger}} {{after my}} return shall carry her full consent to these conditions, {{and there will}} I abide your pleasure until the time comes {{for her to be}} conducted to her convent, if not to see your face, which would <b>be</b> best of <b>all.</b> O madam, what thanks will be worthy of such a grace?" ...|$|R
60|$|It wrung {{my heart}} to see her; it wrung {{my heart to}} hear her. I {{answered}} by a sign--it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do--that I submitted myself to her will.|$|E
60|$|It {{was strange}} {{to be reduced}} to such {{indirect}} evidence on such a point as that; but it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get, and I had to be content with it.|$|E
6000|$|Putney laughed. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do to keep}} Ellen {{from getting}} up and going out of church too, when Brother Gerrish set the example. She's a Gerrishite at heart." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{thought the}} acting was {{unconventional}} and absorbing (especially by Williams, by Glenn Close as his mother, and by John Lithgow as a transsexual). I thought the visualization of the events, by director George Roy Hill, was fresh and consistently interesting. But {{when the movie}} was over, my immediate response <b>was</b> not at <b>all</b> what it should have <b>been.</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find to ask myself was: What the hell <b>was</b> that <b>all</b> about? ...|$|R
60|$|My {{heart was}} thudding with the guns, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to answer {{her for the}} catch of my breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{think you}} know! Well, I'm glad that {{for twenty years}} I've {{mastered}} the longing and kept my head. Now, however, my children have made a fair start, with prospects of going farther than I have done, and my responsibility is lightening. A winter up there would satisfy me--I'm afraid it would <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand now--and though it's still out of the question, I've a feeling that a way may be found before I grow too old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My sweetheart, when I saw {{you doing}} that Dream of What's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from rushing out on {{to the floor and}} hugging you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you are ill, Cristel?" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find to say, under the double {{disadvantage}} of speaking through a door, {{and having a}} father listening at my side.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Nonsense, old chap!' {{said the}} other, {{slapping}} him upon the shoulder. 'I've had a nasty facer myself, but--' That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear, {{but it was}} enough to set me thinking.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He will aye {{be drunk}} {{when the wind}} blaws,' {{returned}} Rorie in the same high key, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to hear him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am in the}} twenty-third year of my life here,' he said, with a {{catch in}} his breath that {{was not so much}} a sob as an irrepressible sound of self-approval, the {{momentary}} outburst of a noble consciousness. 'It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do for my children--I have done it. Amy, my love, you are by far the best loved of the three; I have had you principally in my mind--whatever I have done for your sake, my dear child, I have done freely and without murmuring.' ...|$|R
