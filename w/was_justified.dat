5|$|Nan Chiau High School {{is known}} for its strict {{regulations}} and discipline, with minimal tolerance to misbehaviour of its students. In 2004 the school gained attention for its disciplinary action on a student over misconduct, which was deemed overly harsh. This came despite the backing of many alumni, educators and parents stressing that the action taken <b>was</b> <b>justified.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taqiya ("dissimulation") was {{practiced by}} some Bábís. It <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> {{by some as}} a {{response}} to the often violent oppression the community faced. However, prominent Bábí leaders never encouraged individuals to practice it; and some who had practiced taqiyya later abandoned it, declared themselves openly, and were put to death.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, SMRT Corporation and Land Transport Authority (LTA) {{announced}} that the last ten refurbished trainsets would have one-third of their seats replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space. The move <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> on grounds of allowing more standing space onboard during peak-hour services. The reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters; the decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against the operator and LTA. As of December 2015, all 66 C151s from one-third of their seats {{have been replaced by}} metal bars to create extra standing space.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|Keyes {{supports}} {{an amendment}} to the Constitution barring same-sex marriage. He stated he would not have gone to war in Iraq, but also said that the war <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> and defended President George W. Bush's decision in one of his 2004 debates. Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq, but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} {{imposed on}} {{a speech at}} Speakers' Corner were {{that it had to}} take place only between 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m. on the date notified by the person to the police, had to be in any of Singapore's four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin or Tamil) or any related dialects, and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited. The latter restriction <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> {{on the grounds that it}} would reduce noise pollution and prevent one speaker from drowning out another one, and that it also applied to Speakers' Corner in London.|$|E

5|$|Roope, who drowned when {{he could}} no longer hang on to a rope whilst being pulled {{up the side of the}} cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award <b>was</b> <b>justified,</b> in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made after the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Some {{controversy}} has existed over {{the origins of}} captive breeding stock used by The Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several peregrine subspecies {{were included in the}} breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum (Falco peregrinus anatum), the near extirpation of the anatum in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The US Chief of Army Staff, General Martin Dempsey, said Pakistan's anger <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> {{as it had}} {{a reason}} to be furious given the loss of life. However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying he did not know enough about the {{incident}} and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The current {{president}} is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, {{who took over}} from Paul Nurse on 30 November 2015. Historically, {{the duties of the}} president have been both formal and social. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 left the president {{as one of the few}} individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal <b>was</b> <b>justified.</b> In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E
5|$|The great {{size of the}} {{reservoir}} and the huge relocation it caused <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> by the flood protection it provides for communities downstream. As of June 2008, China relocated 1.24million residents (ending with Gaoyang in Hubei Province) as 13 cities, 140 towns and 1350 villages either flooded or were partially flooded by {{the reservoir}} , about 1.5% of the province's 60.3million and Chongqing Municipality's 31.44million population. About 140,000residents were relocated to other provinces.|$|E
5|$|The {{report was}} duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project no longer <b>was</b> <b>justified.</b> The audited report {{was accepted by}} the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final nail in the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized {{the creation of the}} Yukon Flats National Wildlife Monument, which became the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated any possibility of flooding the Yukon Flats, a process that would have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the second}} phase of expansion, the runway would be {{lengthened}} to , allowing jet aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to land at Mysore Airport. The runway cannot be extended to the west {{because of the presence of}} a railway line, while an extension to the east requires diverting National Highway 766. The State Government initially decided to hold off on this phase, preferring to wait until air traffic increased and the cost of diverting the runway <b>was</b> <b>justified.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Gomułka's anti-Soviet {{image was}} exaggerated, it <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> {{in the popular}} {{imagination}} by his anti-Stalinist line in 1948 and years of subsequent internment. Thus, Polish communists found themselves unexpectedly {{at the head of}} a national liberation movement. The enthusiastic public support offered to Gomułka contributed to the legitimization of communist rule in Poland, which incorporated mass nationalist, anti-Soviet feelings into the prevailing power structures. In Hungary, social protest destroyed the political system; in Poland, it was absorbed within it.|$|E
5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million. The concession <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program. Caixa Econômica Federal is the distributing agent.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism <b>was</b> <b>justified,</b> and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken in this case <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were {{to wait for a}} warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Nagpal was {{suspended}} on 28 July 2013, {{a day after}} she allegedly demolished a wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village, in the Rabupura area of Greater Noida. The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the demolition of the wall, and whether she <b>was</b> <b>justified</b> in her actions even if she was, are disputed. Her supporters {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the demolition of the wall and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the demolition are false. However, there are other sources which quote residents of Kadalpur village claiming that Nagpal personally supervised the demolition of the wall.|$|E
