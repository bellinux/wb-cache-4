50|$|Alston's {{reports to}} the UN {{relating}} to extrajudicial executions also dealt with broad thematic issues that arose in many countries, such as witchcraft and vigilante killings, national-level commissions of inquiry dealing with unlawful killings, the problem of prisoners running prisons, the importance of <b>witness</b> <b>protection</b> <b>programs,</b> the problem of governmental reprisals against individuals or groups who have cooperated with a UN human rights inquiry, the need to regulate the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers, shoot-to-kill policies, the relationship between human rights law and international humanitarian law, mercy killings in times of armed conflict, {{and the need to}} make military justice systems human rights compatible. With respect to the death penalty, Alston's reports discussed the need for transparency, the unacceptability of the mandatory death penalty under international law, the definition of the 'most serious crimes' for which the death penalty may be imposed, the right to seek pardon or commutation of a death sentence, and the juvenile death penalty.|$|R

40|$|As {{individuals}} interact {{on larger}} and larger scales, what makes up their identity also has to expand. In a village, only a single name is enough.

Across the world, a multinational hotel chain may want to identify the same individual whenever he or she stays at one of their hotels, {{but there is no}} single global identifier that makes this possible. Because identities are important in so many interactions, not all of them known to and supervised by individuals, there are considerable economic and privacy risks when identity information is misused. Today, the standard solution to this problem is to mandate legal or policy rules that restrict the flow and use of identity information. This solution is starting to fail for two reasons.

In 2007 Gov. Bill Ritter appointed Rhonda Fields to the Colorado Commission on Criminal Juvenile Justice, where she worked on public safety and criminal justice issues. Fields also testified before the Colorado legislature on two successful bills, one strengthening the state’s <b>Witness</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Programs,</b> as well as the Javad Marshall Fields & Vivian Wolfe <b>Witness</b> <b>Protection</b> Act that is designed to develop better risk-assessment tools to elevate the safety and security of witnesses in criminal trials.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the complex process of transferring cases from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to Rwanda. After {{a decade of}} prosecuting the leaders and organisers of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide that killed an estimated 500, 000 to 1 million ethnic Tutsis, the Security Council of the United Nations called for {{the closure of the}} Tribunal. In an effort to complete all trial activities, the Completion Strategy has involved transferring the indictments of low to mid-level accused to national jurisdictions for trial. With donor fatigue, frustration with the efficiency of the Ad-Hoc tribunals and the desire for states to manage their own issues, there is a shift in enforcement of international criminal law away from international tribunals. The outcome is that national courts will be increasingly responsible for the accountability of international crimes and the application of fair trial rights. As a result, the importance of cases being prosecuted domestically with the appropriate level of fair trial standards and the capacity of national systems will be increasingly important. To transfer a case to a national court, the ICTR has to be satisfied that the court by which the case is referred to has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the case. Moreover, it has to confirm that the standards of trial in respect to fairness are satisfactory. Once the case has been transferred, the ICTR can appoint a monitor to observe the proceedings in the national court. This thesis aims to determine whether the transfer cases to Rwanda were decided with the appropriate fair trial standards. To determine this, this thesis examines the decisions of the ICTR, relevant legislation, Reports of the Monitor as well as academic discussions. Further this thesis demonstrates the importance of capacity building efforts as well as legal reform to improve standards. Improvement of fair trial and penalty standards in Rwanda has involved the creation of new <b>witness</b> <b>protection</b> <b>programs,</b> the abolishment of the death penalty and reform of the Genocide Ideology law. However, this thesis has shown the most challenging part of capacity building by a foreign body is the sensitive and cautious way these issues need to be approached. This thesis concludes that, from the creation of new <b>witness</b> <b>protection</b> <b>programs,</b> video link technology, building of new prisons, judicial training and reforms in legislation, Rwanda has developed the capacity to hold a fair trial. Moreover, twenty years after the genocide, Rwanda has become a neutral territory to hold trials for the transferred cases. However, this author is concerned that these improvements will only affect the handful of cases, which will be transferred. Many Rwandans will not have access to the same safeguards, protection and facilities. Despite these possible inequalities, the correct decision to transfer the cases to Rwanda is a step forward towards ending impunity. It means that Rwanda is willing and able to prosecute their crimes. Following the ICTR’s approach towards strengthening fair trial and penalty standards in Rwanda will be a valuable lesson for the future of International Criminal Law, particularly in light of increased domestic prosecutions...|$|R
40|$|Although the Charter {{has made}} many {{important}} {{improvements to the}} criminal justice system, this paper argues {{that there is a}} need for a greater sense of perspective on the importance of the Charter to the criminal justice system. This paper critically examines the impact of the Charter on rates of imprisonment, rates of pre-trial imprisonment, rates of Aboriginal overrepresentation in prison and among crime victims, rates of crime victimization, national security activities, wrongful convictions, trial delay and complexity, and the Criminal Code. It concludes that the Charter has likely not been a major factor in explaining why Canadian rates of imprisonment have not followed the alarming post- 1982 American trends. Likewise, the Charter cannot take credit for recent reductions in youth imprisonment under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Parliament still very much matters when it comes to Canada’s penal policy. The right to reasonable bail in the Charter has not stopped dramatic increases in remand populations and the Charter has not significantly benefited either crime victims or Aboriginal people, who are over-represented among both crime victims and inmates. Although the Charter has been both a cause and a cure for trial delay, it has only been a partial cause and a partial cure, and fundamental legislative, organizational and cultural changes are needed to respond to trial delay and complexity. Although the Charter has restrained Canadian anti-terrorism law, it has not addressed Canada’s unique and awkward two-court structure for determining national security confidentiality claims, the need for effective <b>witness</b> <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> or the sustainability of using immigration law as a form of anti-terrorism law. Similarly, the Charter has helped recognize and respond to some of the causes of wrongful convictions such as lack of Crown disclosure, but it has not addressed many of the other causes of wrongful convictions or barriers to redress. Although the Charter has trimmed some of the excesses of the Criminal Code, fundamental reforms and simplification are still needed. The Charter can increase the justness of our justice system, but it cannot guarantee it. There is much work to be done and much of it will not involve the Charter...|$|R
