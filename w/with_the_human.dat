5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E
5|$|Dales {{decides to}} {{investigate}} Exley's hometown of Macon, Georgia, and discovers that {{a boy with}} Exley's name had vanished about five years previously. That night at the hotel, Dales hears noises from Exley's hotel room and breaks in, only to find Exley in his true form as an alien. Exley tells Dales that he was forbidden from intermingling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> race but {{fell in love with}} the game of baseball and remained on Earth. Meanwhile, the Alien Bounty Hunter, who has been pursuing the renegade alien ever since he deserted his alien heritage, takes Exley's form and murders a scientist who is investigating the green ooze that Dales found. After learning of the attack, Dales warns Exley that he is now wanted by the police, and Exley goes into hiding.|$|E

Nightbeat also suspects someone has tampered with his memory. Elsewhere, Sixshot, having encountered and felt a kinship with the Reapers before, defects to their side, but is taken out by a returned Starscream (revived by the other Decepticons {{to stand up to}} Megatron), leading to a full-scale battle between the Decepticons and Reapers. The Decepticons win, with aid from Galvatron, who escapes with Sixshot's body as the US military locates the Decepticons' base. Scorponok merges <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> Dante into a new body, but is unable to prevent Hunter, now merged with Sunstreaker's mind in a copy of his body, from escaping.

5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> form, MacDonald {{points out that}} Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E

5|$|The Zarubintsy culture circle, in {{existence}} roughly from 200 BC to 150 AD, extended along {{the middle and}} upper Dnieper and its tributary the Pripyat River, but also left traces of settlements in parts of Polesie and the upper Bug River basin. The main distinguished local groups were the Polesie group, the Middle Dnieper group and the Upper Dnieper group. The Zarubintsy culture developed from the Milograd culture {{in the northern part of}} its range and from the local Scythian populations in the more southern part. The Polesie group's origin was also influenced by the Pomeranian and Jastorf cultures. The Zarubintsy culture and its beginnings were moderately affected by La Tène culture and the Black Sea area (trade with the Greek cities provided imported items) centers of civilization in the earlier stages, but not much by Roman influence later on, and accordingly its economic development was lagging behind that of other early Roman period cultures. Cremation of bodies was practiced, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> remains and burial gifts including metal decorations, small in number and limited in variety, placed in pits.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E
