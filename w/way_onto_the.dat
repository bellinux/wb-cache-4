5|$|On 12 April 2012, a coup d'état in Guinea-Bissau {{was staged}} by {{elements}} {{of the armed forces}} about two weeks before the second round of a presidential election between Carlos Gomes Júnior and Kumba Ialá. The coup started in the evening with military personnel and equipment making its <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> streets, followed by the state-owned media being taken off-air.|$|E
5|$|Key {{continued}} New Zealand's {{push for}} {{a spot on the}} UN Security Council while in New York in 2013. There he accused rival candidates Spain and Turkey of using aid money to buy votes from small African countries, and said New Zealand would not be spending its <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Council. While in New York, Key suddenly fell ill, but recovered in time for meetings with representatives from other countries ahead of the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Lucic played minor hockey (VMHA) in Vancouver, {{but nearly}} quit the sport after being passed {{up in the}} 2003 WHL Bantam Draft. He was invited {{to play for the}} Coquitlam Express of the Junior A British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), but was further {{demoralized}} when he initially failed to make the team out of rookie camp. He agreed to play, instead, for the Junior B Delta Ice Hawks, but later played his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Express after five games.|$|E
50|$|In a very {{competitive}} era in Tyrone football, Carlin has fought his <b>way</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> first team lineup by 2007.|$|R
50|$|Moylan fought his <b>way</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Cork {{starting}} fifteen in 1940, however, he {{left the}} panel {{at the end of}} the season.|$|R
50|$|During Kimishima's {{time working}} at Pokémon USA Inc. from 2000 to 2002 {{there was a}} release of popular Pokémon games that found their <b>ways</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> market and into the homes of consumers. On October 15, 2000 in North America Pokémon Gold and Silver were both {{released}} on the Game Boy Color. The Pokémon game known as Pokémon Crystal was released on July 29, 2001 also for the Game Boy Color.|$|R
5|$|Following {{his sophomore}} year, {{he signed a}} three-year, {{entry-level}} contract with the Canadiens on May 22, 2003. Higgins made his NHL debut on October 11, 2003, registering three minutes of ice time in a 4–0 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Struggling to play his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Canadiens' lineup, he was often made a healthy scratch (non-dressing player) in October before being assigned to the team's minor league affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL), {{by the end of}} the month. He recorded 48 points over 67 AHL games in 2003–04, ranking fifth in team scoring. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Higgins automatically remained in Hamilton and improved to 51 points, ranking third among Bulldogs scorers.|$|E
5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} two outs and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had made its <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E
5|$|About {{halfway between}} Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức, White {{and the rest}} of the column climbed a {{mountain}} where they cleared the jungle to create a landing zone, and called for helicopters to evacuate the survivors. A flight of CH-46 Sea Knights later arrived and, in a scene that would be repeated at Khâm Đức, chaos descended on the allied formation as Nung and U.S personnel fought their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> helicopters. Some of the Nung soldiers had to be thrown off because the helicopters quickly reached their limit capacity; eventually U.S. aircrews had to dump some of their equipment overboard to accommodate the last remaining Nungs on the landing zone. By 08:00, the evacuation of the Ngok Tavak survivors was completed, and White immediately flew out to Đà Nẵng along with the two Australian Warrant Officers after they arrived in Khâm Đức. The fight at Ngok Tavak, though short in duration, took a heavy toll on the allied forces. An unknown number of Nung soldiers and 12 U.S. military personnel were killed, and 52 (including two U.S. Army and 21 U.S Marines) were wounded.|$|E
50|$|Stalactites is a {{solitaire}} {{card game}} {{which uses a}} deck of 52 playing cards. The game is similar to Freecell, but it is different because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> building <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> foundations and the tableau.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Molenschot {{has also}} {{been active in the}} remix side of producing. A mix he {{performed}} made its <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> Trance.nu's Surviving <b>the</b> Chills compilation in 2002.|$|R
6000|$|Tance smiled foolishly {{inside his}} helmet. [...] "I must have {{put my finger}} over the lens. I'll be more careful." [...] He made his <b>way</b> up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> {{circular}} slab, stepping gingerly behind {{the body of the}} gun. He disappeared from view.|$|R
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|To {{play for}} an inter-county GAA team, Canavan {{had to work}} around a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) bylaw, because of a dispute in his parish, Errigal Ciarán. Two clubs claimed to {{represent}} the parish, the established Ballygawley St. Ciaran's club and the newly formed club, then called Errigal Ciaran Naomh Malachai. Players from the Errigal team were not recognised as being GAA members, because the club failed to register correctly. Canavan registered {{as a member of}} the Killyclogher hurling club, even though he didn't play the sport, just so he would be eligible for selection for the Tyrone minors. Prior to that, he had not played legitimate club football, but had forged his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Tyrone under-age teams with his performances at school level. The two clubs united under the banner of Errigal Ciaran two years later.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them {{to fall into the}} sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E
5000|$|The hymn {{even made}} its <b>way</b> briefly <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> operatic stage. The singer Emma Abbott, {{prompted}} by [...] "her uncompromising and grotesque puritanism" [...] rewrote La traviata so that Violetta expired singing not Verdi's Addio del passato, but [...] "Nearer My God to Thee".|$|R
5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of his solo-exhibitions at the Municipal Museum for Contemporary Art (Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, SMAK) in Ghent, [...] "Crack", a comprehensive catalogue, was published, edited by Wouter Davidts, and with contributions by, among others John Welchman, Andrew Renton and Dirk Lauwaert. In this monography, {{as well as in}} the exhibition a broad overview was given of van den Broek's career until then, and this helped him to draw [...] "…new conclusions from my older work and this gave me the energy to keep on developing my familiar motives of the urban landscape and how this can be translated in new <b>ways</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> canvas." ...|$|R
50|$|Some ELPowell studio rehearsals {{and live}} {{recordings}} found their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> bootlegs in <b>the</b> 1990s. The material was subsequently remastered and given an official release on two 2003 CDs, available via the ELP website.|$|R
25|$|Outside of {{classical}} heraldry, lions {{have also found}} their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> coats of arms or emblems used by modern states in Asia, often based on traditional depictions of lions in the respective cultures or regions.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, McTell {{undertook}} a special {{tour of the}} UK. Billed as 'The National Tour', it gave McTell a chance to present concerts featuring his newly acquired National Steel resonator guitar. Two live recordings from the National Tour made their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> 2002 Leola album National Treasure.|$|E
25|$|British naval attacks, however, {{failed to}} break through the Dardanelles Strait and the British decided to support their fleet with a land attack. The land {{campaign}} took place between 25 April 1915, and 9 January 1916. With his division stationed in Gallipoli, Mustafa Kemal found himself at the centre of the Allies' attempts to force their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> peninsula.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "steel beach" [...] in {{question}} is Luna, Earth's moon and the most heavily inhabited world {{in the solar system}} since the Invaders obliterated human civilization on Earth; the title alludes to humans being figuratively thrown <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> inhospitable moon, paralleling fish that made their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> land in <b>the</b> evolution of amphibians.|$|R
5000|$|... "Chuck Versus the Pink Slip" [...] is {{the third}} season premiere episode of the {{television}} series Chuck. It aired on January 10, 2010 in a special two-episode block. After failing [...] "spy school", Chuck must find his <b>way</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> team, {{and in the process}} repair his shattered relationship with Sarah.|$|R
5000|$|Bowerman [...] took {{a female}} hostage {{and held a}} shotgun on her as he {{attempted}} to escape, making his <b>way</b> out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk before he shoved the woman to the pavement, breaking both her wrists. Bowerman {{was shot in the}} chest by police officer Melburn F. Stein. The bullet pierced a lung and lodged in his spine.|$|R
25|$|The {{response}} of the Ollie K. Wilds, commercial towboats, and the local Coast Guard units was commendable. Had the ferry not overturned so rapidly, their immediate response would have been instrumental in saving a number of lives. Unfortunately, the first rescuers were only able to find and rescue two survivors from the river; other survivors made their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> overturned hull.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} Goodson-Todman shows gone, lesser-known Sony {{properties}} such as Juvenile Jury, The Diamond Head Game, the 1976–77 version of Break the Bank, and the Bill Cullen-hosted games Chain Reaction and Pass the Buck all found their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> schedule. Shows from Chuck Barris also aired during this time, including The Newlywed Game, The Dating Game, The Gong Show, Treasure Hunt and 3's a Crowd.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{minority}} officers, however, has remained small. A cadet {{program aimed at}} smoothing the <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> force for black and Hispanic young people was struck down in 1997 as unconstitutional reverse discrimination. On top of that, a well-publicized cheating scandal on the 1996 police exam further undermined confidence in {{the fairness of the}} hiring process. Controversy surrounding these issues has abated somewhat, but has not gone away entirely.|$|E
50|$|When {{vertebrates}} {{found their}} <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> land, <b>the</b> hyomandibula, with its location near the ear, began {{to function as}} a sound amplifier beside its function to support the skull. As evolution later attached the cranium of terrestrial vertebrates {{to the rest of the}} skull, the hyomandibula lost its supportive function and became an interior organ, the stapes, and thus its secondary function had become its primary function.|$|R
5000|$|The {{unwinding}} {{of much of}} Alliance's momentum helped Labour defend most {{of their}} 1982 losses, with the Conservative and Alliance gains restricted to a seat apiece in Morley North and Burmantofts respectively. The Conservative ousted by the Alliance gain in ultra-marginal Horsforth the year before won his <b>way</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> council with the only other gain of the night.|$|R
50|$|In February 2000, Gaffney {{was charged}} with {{allegedly}} stealing $245 and a watch from the Florida Field locker room during the high school state championships, but the prosecutor placed him in a pretrial diversion program. After Steve Spurrier kicked him off the team in December 1999, he was eventually allowed to earn his <b>way</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> squad but forfeited his scholarship for a year.|$|R
25|$|Nearby, the PAVN 9th Regiment {{still held}} Route 23. Beginning {{at the end}} of October, the RLG forces {{repeatedly}} attacked Laongam on Route 23. A Thai mercenary battalion drawn from ranger forces was turned back with heavy casualties. On 17 November, two other Thai battalions failed in an assault. However, a newly arrived battalion still lacking its heavy weapons took up the attack and was successful in pushing its <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Bolovens Plateau.|$|E
25|$|Football {{first made}} its <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Iowa State campus in 1878 as a {{recreational}} sport, but it wasn't until 1892 that an organized group of athletes first represented Iowa State in football. In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded {{the foundation of}} an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams. The 1894 team finished with a 6–1 mark, including a 16–8 victory over {{what is now the}} University of Iowa.|$|E
25|$|Simmons tells Duncan that he {{will use}} the {{breeches}} buoy next, but Duncan punches him, saying the men will draw numbers {{but he and his}} son-in-law will be the last to leave. The fire reaches the Promenade Room and Simmons forces his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> buoy, leading to a struggle. Parker is pushed to his death by Simmons. An explosion severs the lines to the breeches buoy, causing Simmons and others to fall to their deaths.|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork Media stated [...] "Young & Sick is {{a remarkably}} {{polished}} debut, with each song boasting careful, painstaking arrangements and adept uses of space. It's charming, undeniable music that bops its <b>way</b> out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> dance floor with relaxed charm, and it shimmers with the seductive murmur of a lounge staple." [...] Earmilk added {{the album was}} [...] "the stuff of music lovers' dreams." ...|$|R
5000|$|Architect Pierluigi Serraino {{described}} Hillmer's architecture as [...] "assertive, but it's always benevolent.

50|$|On August 26, the Greeks {{attacked}} {{all along}} the line. Crossing the shallow Gök, the infantry fought its <b>way</b> step up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> heights where every ridge and hill top had to be stormed against strong entrenchments and withering fire.|$|R
