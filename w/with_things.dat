5|$|Steins;Gate {{is set in}} {{the summer}} of 2010, {{approximately}} one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering <b>with</b> <b>things.</b> The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game. The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter {{what has happened in the}} future.|$|E
5|$|Shiren the Wanderer is a roguelike game {{in which}} the player {{traverses}} thirty randomly generated grid-based, top-down areas – referred to as floors – in which they fight enemies and find items. The player can move in eight directions, attack with melee weapons and arrows, and use {{a wide range of}} items with different effects: for example, some heal the player, some fling away enemies, and some allow the player to swap positions with an enemy. The items are kept in the player's inventory, which only has a limited amount of space. For every step the player takes, their health regenerates, but their fullness counter also decreases; because of this, the player needs to carry food items with them, which also take up inventory space. The gameplay is turn-based: every time the player performs an action, such as moving, attacking, or using items, all enemies and characters in the area perform one action as well. In addition to the enemy characters, there are friendly characters, three of which can join the player's party and help them <b>with</b> <b>things</b> such as healing.|$|E

30|$|Table  1 {{shows how}} {{elemental}} semantic categories are realized {{due to the}} notion of semantic junction. Elemental categories, quality, process, circumstance, relator, an empty category, thing and circumstance are placed with congruent examples in the first column. Columns 2 to 5 illustrate how joining elemental categories create GM instances. Type 1 results from the joining of quality <b>with</b> <b>thing,</b> and is referred to as “quality thing”. Type 2 represents the joining of process and thing, and might be called “process thing”. Type 3 depends on the semantic junction of process and quality, thus it is refereed to as “process quality”. Types 4, 5 and 6 present how circumstance joins <b>with</b> <b>thing,</b> quality and process creating semantic junction. Types 7, 8, 9 and 10 represent the semantic junction of relator and <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> process, quality, and circumstance. Types 11 and 12 represent the semantic junction of an empty category and <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> process (N.B. although Halliday & Matthiessen do not define an empty category as an element). Moreover, Type 13 is an extension of the environments of Type 1 and Type 2.|$|R
6000|$|If we generalize this process, {{and look}} out for the {{principle}} or law involved in every such inference, and presupposed in every syllogism, the propositions of which are any thing more than merely verbal; we find, not the unmeaning dictum de omni et nullo, but a fundamental principle, or rather two principles, strikingly resembling the axioms of mathematics. The first, which is the principle of affirmative syllogisms, is, that <b>things</b> which co-exist <b>with</b> the same <b>thing,</b> co-exist <b>with</b> one another: or (still more precisely) a <b>thing</b> which co-exists <b>with</b> another <b>thing,</b> which other co-exists <b>with</b> a third <b>thing,</b> also co-exists <b>with</b> that third <b>thing.</b> The second is the principle of negative syllogisms, and is to this effect: that a <b>thing</b> which co-exists <b>with</b> another <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> which other a third thing does not co-exist, is not co-existent <b>with</b> that third <b>thing.</b> These axioms manifestly relate to facts, and not to conventions; and one or other {{of them is the}} ground of the legitimacy of every argument in which facts and not conventions are the matter treated of.(53) ...|$|R

25|$|According to this theory, cool is a zero sum game, {{in which}} cool exists only in {{comparison}} <b>with</b> <b>things</b> considered less cool; for example, {{in the book}} The Rebel Sell, cool is created out of a need for status and distinction. This creates a situation analogous to an arms race, in which cool is perpetuated by a collective action problem in society.|$|E
25|$|In America, {{not only}} do U.S. {{students}} receive sex education within school or religious programs, {{but they are also}} educated by their parents.

A family helper, a college girl, finally put a name (then little-known as a subject) to his set of interests: physics. When Slater entered the University of Rochester in 1917 he took physics courses and as a senior assisted in the physics laboratory and did his first independent research for a special honors thesis, a measurement of the dependence on pressure of the intensities of the Balmer lines of hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|While Natale ran the family, Merlino and {{his young}} allies {{maintained}} control on the street, collecting extortion payments and profiting from rackets and schemes Natale was not made aware of. Merlino was also the crime family's main link {{to many of the}} other criminal groups in Philadelphia. Merlino was only 32 years old, an extremely young age for any Mafia member, let alone a leader of a Mafia family. Merlino and his allies were all young and unexperienced in running a criminal organization of such magnitude. They were also flashy, violent and loved the limelight. Merlino was often spotted by reporters and cameramen on the streets of South Philadelphia followed by a large entourage. Merlino's high-profile brought a lot of attention from the press and law enforcement. The crime family itself was unstable, <b>with</b> <b>things</b> poorly managed by Merlino's crew whose violent reputation was used to keep things in order. The Merlino faction's arrogance and aggressiveness turned off a lot of criminals from working with the crime family. Merlino's associates were also involved in drug deals in Philadelphia and Boston while overseeing the crime family's gambling, loan sharking, stolen goods and extortion rackets.|$|E

25|$|The {{progress}} of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired {{in the course of}} their existence. Modern society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a garden, some friends. Children must be reared in contact <b>with</b> <b>things</b> which are the expression of the mind of their parents. It is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer, the artisan, the artist, the professor, and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians, possessing nothing but their hands or their brains. The development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of industrial civilization. It has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit, and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense. It is destroying the remains of culture. All forms of the proletariat must be suppressed. Each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family. Marriage must cease being only a temporary union. The union of man and woman, like that of the higher anthropoids, ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection. The laws relating to education, and especially to that of girls, to marriage, and divorce should, above all, take into account the interest of children. Women should receive a higher education, not in order to become doctors, lawyers, or professors, but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings.|$|E
