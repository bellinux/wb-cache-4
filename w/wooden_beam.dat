While there, she became involved with, then married, one of the anarchists she met: Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin.

5|$|Construction {{began on}} October 10, 1888. The Big Four Bridge {{would be the}} only Louisville bridge with serious {{accidents}} during its building; thirty-seven individuals died during its construction. The first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a caisson that was supposed to hold back the river water flooded, drowning the workers. Another four men died a few months after that when a <b>wooden</b> <b>beam</b> broke while working on a different pier caisson.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or <b>wooden</b> <b>beam</b> – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify different analytical methods which permit the calcula-tion of the stress level in <b>wooden</b> simply supported <b>beams,</b> due to mechanical and thermal loading conditions. Two different wood species, with different cross-sections, will be presented. The fi re resistance, the charring depth layer and the charring rate will be determined using the fi nite element method with Ansys ® program. To characterize the stress state in <b>wooden</b> <b>beams,</b> all elements are subjected to mechanical load considering the reduction of the cross-section, infl uenced by thermal action. Another purpose of this work is to identify the ultimate safe load-bearing capacity in <b>wooden</b> <b>beams,</b> subjected to uniform load simultaneously with the thermal effect. All numerical results per-mit the specifi cation of simple design calculation methods, simplifying the verifi cation of the fi re safety of <b>wooden</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

They find him trapped beneath a <b>wooden</b> <b>beam,</b> and are able to drag him out to safety. Ryan goes back up the ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy stares at the pub as it is completely destroyed.|$|E

On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century. The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large <b>wooden</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long <b>wooden</b> <b>beam</b> separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E

5|$|Established as a seaport by the Vikings and Danish traders {{at the end}} of the 8th {{century in}} the Prussian border area {{previously}} already explored by the Scandinavians, Truso lasted as a major city and commercial center until the early 11th century, when it was destroyed and replaced in that capacity by Gdańsk. The settlement covered an area of 20 hectares and consisted of a two-dock seaport, the craft-trade portion, and the peripheral residential development, all protected by a wood and earth bulwark separating it from the mainland. The port-trade and craftsmen zones were themselves separated by a fire control ditch with water flowing through it. There were several rows of houses, including long Viking hall structures, waterside warehouses, market areas and <b>wooden</b> <b>beam</b> covered streets. Numerous relics were found there, including weights used also as currency units, coins (from English to Arab) and workshops processing metal, jewelry or large quantities of amber. Remnants of long Viking boats were also found, the whole complex being a testimony to Viking preoccupation with commerce, the mainstay of their activities around the Baltic Sea region. The multi-ethnic Truso had extensive trade contacts not only with distant lands and Scandinavia, but also the Slavic areas located to the south and west of it, from where ceramics and other products were transported along the Vistula in river crafts. Ironically, Truso's sudden destruction by fire and subsequent disappearance was apparently a result of a Viking raid.|$|E

A large section of wing came down on Grand Avenue in South San Francisco, starting a grass fire. A 6-foot section of the wing hit the ground in Holy Cross cemetery and a charred chunk of the engine exhaust struck the rear of a housing area, also in South San Francisco. No injuries were reported.|$|E

25|$|Usually {{the chair}} was {{fastened}} to a long <b>wooden</b> <b>beam</b> fixed as a seesaw {{on the edge of}} a pond or river. Sometimes, however, the ducking-stool was not a fixture but was mounted on a pair of wooden wheels so that it could be wheeled through the streets, and at the river-edge was hung by a chain from the end of a beam. In sentencing a woman the magistrates ordered the number of duckings she should have. Yet another type of ducking-stool was called a tumbrel. It was a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This was pushed into the pond and then the shafts released, thus tipping the chair up backwards. Sometimes the punishment proved fatal and the victim died.|$|E

30|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to detect nondestructively some defects such as knots and grain deviations in wood using modal analysis. The shapes of flexural vibration waves at the first mode generated by the tapping of <b>wooden</b> <b>beams</b> were determined using the transfer function.

The results are summarized as follows: (1) The shapes of flexural vibration waves at the first mode of <b>wooden</b> <b>beams</b> free of defects coincided almost completely with the theoretical wave shape. (2) The shapes of flexural vibration waves of <b>wooden</b> <b>beams</b> containing defects such as knots clearly differed from the theoretical wave shape, especially near the defect. (3) Based on these results, {{it should be possible to}} detect the presence of defects and to determine their location in wood.|$|R

500|$|The straw ropes used in juldarigi are immense, up to 200m {{in length}} and 1m in diameter. They can weigh as much as 40 tons. They are {{constructed}} of twisted rice straw; this choice of material is symbolic, since rice is the staple grain in the areas where juldarigi is practiced. The construction process is a communal event, reflecting the communal nature of rice cultivation. Two ropes are used, one for each team; they are connected by a <b>wooden</b> <b>beam</b> or stump known as a binyeomok, around three metres long. The rope held by the Eastern team is termed the sutjul ( [...] "male rope") and the Western team hold the amjul ( [...] "female rope"). [...] Because of the ropes' great size, they cannot be grasped directly; players attached smaller side-ropes to the main rope to act as handles and fray its ends to provide additional hand-holds.|$|E
