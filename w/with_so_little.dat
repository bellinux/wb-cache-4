5|$|On graduation, Kilburn was {{recruited}} by C.P. Snow. He {{was given a}} quick course in electronics, and was posted to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern, where he worked on radar in Group 19 under Frederic Calland Williams. The group was responsible for designing and debugging electronic circuitry. Although Williams was initially disappointed at being given someone <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> practical experience, Kilburn became a valued member of the team. On 14 August 1943, he married Irene Marsden, a shop assistant. They went on to raise a son, John, and a daughter, Anne.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> noise or confusion.|$|E

5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> time left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived {{at the feet of}} Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of the}} area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} historian Silborne {{writing in}} the middle of the 19th century thought that never, perhaps, did a defeated army extricate itself from its difficulties with so much adroitness and order, or retire from a hard fought field <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> diminution of its moral force.|$|E

25|$|It {{was curious}} that an {{organization}} like the IWW with its revolutionary philosophy and its reputation for violence conducted a major strike <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> violence.

In all the arrests of strikers for picketing, there is no case where a striker was accused of carrying firearms.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier {{urged the}} {{establishment}} of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.|$|E

25|$|The {{vitreous}} is the transparent, colourless, {{gelatinous mass}} that fills {{the space between}} the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye. It is produced by certain retinal cells. It is of rather similar composition to the cornea, but contains very few cells (mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field, as well as the hyalocytes of Balazs of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the hyaluronic acid), no blood vessels, and 98–99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of collagen type II fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid, and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts. Amazingly, <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> solid matter, it tautly holds the eye.|$|E
25|$|Although Disentis {{managed to}} escape the {{dissolution}} which was the fate of most religious houses at that time, the 19th century was nevertheless a difficult and precarious period, with dangerously diminished material resources coupled {{with a loss of}} morale and spiritual discipline so severe that the abbey was not expected to survive. In desperation, Abbot Paul Birker of St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich, was sent in to attempt to turn the situation around, but <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> success that in 1861 he left Disentis and returned to Munich as a simple monk. Nevertheless, despite all the signs to the contrary, the abbey did survive. In 1880, with the restoration of religious houses in Switzerland, Disentis opened a secondary school, which continues to this day, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had entirely regained its spiritual and material health.|$|E
25|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} by Richard Simon, who made some extracts for John Mill, who used {{readings of the}} codex in his edition of Novum Testamentum in Greek. Montfaucon, published the first facsimile of the codex, with text of Matthew 2:19–22, and used this manuscript for his palaeographical studies. Wettstein, textual critic, used readings of the codex but with not great accuracy (with {{a large number of}} errors). Scholz, textual critic, though valued it very highly, collated the text of the manuscript and edited its textual variants in 1820, but <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> care and with numerous errors that his testimony is worth but little. Tischendorf in 1842 and 1849, and Tregelles in 1950 gave a new and more accurate collation (in 1950 in Leipzig they compare their collations and made one). It is cited in Tischendorf's Editio Octava Critica maior. Scrivener published its facsimile with text of Gospel of John 6:52–53.|$|E

25|$|Born 1 October 1900 in Gloucester, Goddard joined Gloucestershire in 1922 as a fast bowler, Goddard met <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> {{success in}} his first six years {{that he was not}} re-engaged by Gloucestershire for 1928. However, {{determined}} to succeed, he joined the ground staff at Lord's and switched to off spin. With his massive hands and steep bounce due to his height (about 190 centimetres or six feet three inches), he was an immediate success and Gloucestershire re-engaged him for 1929. Even on the best of wickets Goddard was able to turn the ball substantially, and when the turf was worn or sticky he could spin to a remarkable degree. He earned a reputation as a voracious appealer, a sworn enemy of batsmen. Owing to his high trajectory, he could be easy to hit (it is estimated he was hit for 70 sixes a season between 1934 and 1938), and it is probable that this is why he was so expensive against the incomparable 1948 Australian side, and in some cases in county cricket. He played only once against Australia (in 1930) and only eight times against all countries – for much of Goddard's time, Hedley Verity was the preferred England spin bowler, and it is often thought that leg spinners rather than off spinners were favoured at this time in Tests. His successes in the matches he played (he did a hat-trick against South Africa in 1938–39) suggests he might have done well with more opportunities. He finished with six hat-tricks, the same as Parker and only one less than the all-time record of seven, held by D. V. P. Wright of Kent.|$|E
