Growth media {{is a mixture of}} sugar, proteins and minerals that allows microscopic life to grow. It is used in hospitals, where swabs from patients are placed in dishes containing growth media for diagnostic purposes. Iraq's hospital consumption of growth media was just 200kg a year; yet in 1988, Iraq imported 39 tons of it.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{announced}} on 19 May 2006 that {{his decision to}} step down from the shadow cabinet had been based on a decision to pursue a quest to establish the truth behind the death in 2003 of David Kelly, an expert in biological warfare employed by the Ministry of Defence and a former United Nations <b>weapons</b> <b>inspector</b> in Iraq. Kelly's discussion with BBC Today programme journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government's dossier on {{weapon of mass destruction}} (WMD) in Iraq inadvertently caused a major political scandal. Kelly had been found dead days after appearing before the Parliamentary committee investigating the scandal.|$|E
25|$|David Christopher Kelly, CMG (14 May 1944 – 17 July 2003) was a Welsh {{scientist}} and authority on biological warfare, {{employed by the}} British Ministry of Defence, and formerly a <b>weapons</b> <b>inspector</b> with the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq. He came to public attention in July 2003 when an unauthorised discussion he had off the record with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government's dossier on {{weapons of mass destruction}} in Iraq was cited by Gilligan and led to a major controversy. Kelly's name became known to the media as Gilligan's source and he was called to appear on 15 July before a parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee investigating the issues Gilligan had reported. Kelly was questioned aggressively about his actions. He was found dead two days later.|$|E

5000|$|On CBS, President Bush said U.N. <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors,</b> {{before they}} were denied access to Iraq in 1998, {{concluded}} that Saddam was [...] "six months away from developing a weapon." [...] He also cited satellite photos released by a U.N. agency Friday that show unexplained construction at Iraq sites that <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> once visited to search for evidence Saddam was trying to develop nuclear arms. [...] "I don't know what more evidence we need," [...] Bush said.|$|R
25|$|In 1989, Kelly was {{involved}} in investigations into Soviet violations of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and was a key member of the inspection team visiting the USSR and former Soviet states on several occasions 1991 and 1994. His experience with biological weapons at Porton Down led to his selection as a United Nations <b>weapons</b> <b>inspector</b> in Iraq {{following the end of}} the Gulf War. Kelly's work {{as a member of the}} UNSCOM team led him to visit Iraq thirty-seven times, and his success in uncovering Iraq's biological weapons programme led to Rolf Ekéus nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1996. Although he was never a member of the intelligence services, the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) regularly sought his opinion on Iraq and other issues. Kelly became a member of the Bahá'í Faith around 1999. He was introduced to this faith by Mai Pederson, a US military linguist and intelligence operative.|$|E
25|$|Organized {{opposition}} to a possible future military attack against Iran by the United States (US) {{is known to have}} started during 2005–2006. Beginning in early 2005, journalists, activists, and academics such as Seymour Hersh, Scott Ritter, Joseph Cirincione, and Jorge E. Hirsch began publishing claims that American concerns over the alleged threat posed by Iran's nuclear program might lead the US government to take military action against that country in the future. These reports, and the concurrent escalation of tensions between Iran and some Western governments, prompted the formation of grassroots organisations, including Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran in the US and the United Kingdom, to advocate against potential military strikes on Iran. Additionally, several organizations and individuals, including the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, a former United Nations <b>weapons</b> <b>inspector</b> in Iraq, Scott Ritter, the Non-Aligned Movement of 118 states, and the Arab League, have publicly stated their {{opposition to}} a would-be attack on Iran.|$|E

Kröd insists the group is safe there, but is surprised when innkeeper Hugo (Dominic Coleman) tries to poison him for reward money, as Dongalor is offering a substantial reward for Krod and Aneka, dead or alive. An angry mob arrives to try to capture the pair and Hugo threatens to burn the stronghold down. But when his two wives arrive and meet each other, a fearful Hugo risks his life to help Kröd and his friends escape. Meanwhile, the evil Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) learns {{at a press conference}} that the Emperor Xanus is sending a <b>weapons</b> <b>inspector</b> to investigate his castle. He orders his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) to hide the Eye of Gulga Grymna, an ancient weapon Dongalor has been secretly studying.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq, Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief <b>weapons</b> <b>inspector,</b> blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive {{to the demands of the}} Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, which severely hampered UNSCOM's ability to cooperate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country. Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result, they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan, which could have taken days, if not weeks. He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site.|$|E
2500|$|Former UN <b>weapons</b> <b>inspector</b> Scott Ritter later accused some UNSCOM {{personnel}} of spying, {{and also}} {{alleged that the}} purpose of the spying was to target Saddam in the bombing.
