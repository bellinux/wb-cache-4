500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears wearing a sparkly black dress at a {{dressing}} table, putting mascara and Circus Fantasy on. Then, it cuts to her holding her hair up and singing the first lines {{in front of}} a white background. There are also black and white scenes of her wearing a white leotard behind a foggy glass. She then appears wearing the leotard and glasses, while surrounded by four female dancers wearing black outfits, hanging from a raised [...] The word [...] "sin" [...] is censored and changed for the word [...] "this" [...] during the pre-chorus. In the chorus, she dances {{in front of a}} white wall with barcode-like light installations with six male dancers. There also [...] scenes of her dancing provocatively with two male dancers. At the bridge, there are intercut close-ups of her that end <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk.</b> The video concludes with Spears dancing with the two male dancers and cuts to a close-up of her looking into the camera.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the animators {{who worked}} on the film were {{professionals}} that Bakshi had previously worked with at Terrytoons, including Jim Tyer, John Gentilella, Nick Tafuri, Martin Taras, Larry Riley, and Cliff Augustine. According to Bakshi, it took quite a long time to assemble the right staff. Those who entered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk,</b> [...] "wanting to be very dirty and draw filthy pictures", did not stay very long, and neither did those with a low tolerance for vulgarity. One cartoonist refused to draw a black crow shooting a pig policeman. Two female animators quit; one because she could not bring herself to tell her children what she did for a living, the other because she refused to draw exposed breasts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so-not so," [...] {{said the}} mercer, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirking</b> laugh--"not {{altogether}} so--but curiosity, thou knowest, and {{a strain of}} compassion withal; for the poor young lady sees nothing from morn to even but Tony Foster, with his scowling black brows, his bull's head, and his bandy legs." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>with</b> <b>a</b> self-satisfied <b>smirk</b> he half-cocked {{the rifle}} {{and handed it}} to me ready for action.|$|R
60|$|He reappeared {{in about}} five minutes, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hateful <b>smirk</b> upon his well-cut but {{somewhat}} pasty features. I laid my hand upon his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{can have}} no apprehensions of gentlemen of your appearance," [...] said the divine, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk.</b> [...] "It is the natives that I apprehend." ...|$|E
6000|$|Said JANE, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk,</b> and a blush on her face, [...] "I'll {{promise to}} wed the boy Who takes me to-morrow to Epsom Race!" [...] (Which I would have done, with joy).|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is coming}} round," [...] said Meagle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk.</b> [...] "By the time I {{have done with}} him {{he will be a}} {{confirmed}} believer. Well, who will go and get some water? Will you, Barnes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Little Tim, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> self-satisfied <b>smirk,</b> as he seated {{himself on}} the branch and {{surveyed}} the four ropes complacently, [...] "it'll puzzle the biggest b'ar in all the Rocky Mountains to break them ropes." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{caricature}} of Martin Van Buren as an opossum.

60|$|Just at {{this moment}} some unfortunate {{individual}} appears, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very <b>smirking</b> air, {{at the bottom of}} the long passage. He has managed to elude the vigilance of the special constable downstairs, and is evidently congratulating himself on having made his way so far.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{not doing}} this against any of the young ladies," [...] said Link Merwell, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> at Laura that made Dave's sister turn away in disdain. [...] "We are only doing it to square {{accounts}} with Dave Porter and his cronies. We owe them a good deal,--and {{this is the first}} installment." ...|$|E
60|$|Basil {{answered}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> that {{fees and}} legal affairs were inseparable; the latter naturally involved the former. Not that he cared for money, he remarked, {{especially in this}} time of general woe. Still, it would never do for a lawyer, however humble, to create a precedent which might be used against his craft in better days. Then he named a sum.|$|E
60|$|The {{conclusion}} of this affecting narrative {{brought them to the}} house. In the passage they encountered Mr Mould the undertaker; a little elderly gentleman, bald, and in a suit of black; with a notebook in his hand, a massive gold watch-chain dangling from his fob, and a face in which a queer attempt at melancholy was at odds <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> of satisfaction; so that he looked as a man might, who, in the very act of smacking his lips over choice old wine, tried to make believe it was physic.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} a {{footstep}} close at hand made them both turn their heads. Along the winding path came Da Souza, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ugly <b>smirk</b> upon his white face, smoking a cigar whose odour seemed to poison the air. Trent turned upon him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of thunder.|$|R
5000|$|Renate Drucker {{bought up}} her daughter, Constanze, {{as a single}} mother which was unusual {{in the context of}} the time and place. One {{relatively}} eulogistic source refers to certain male colleagues who addressed her <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ill-concealed <b>smirk</b> as [...] "Miss Drucker" [...] at this time. In later years she was also able - apparently slightly to her own surprise - to become a devoted grandmother.|$|R
50|$|Thus enters Akira, a dangerously {{reckless}} man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> perpetual evil <b>smirk,</b> <b>a</b> ridiculously flamboyant {{sense of}} style, drop-dead gorgeous looks, an endlessly annoying personality and a libido that just keeps going and going. Despite Kento's previous dream {{of family and}} Akira's fear of abandonment, the two continue their relationship {{over a period of}} three years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay! I'm serious enough," [...] Wingrave answered. [...] "Do {{you suppose}} a man, {{with the best}} pages of his life rooted out, is likely to look out upon his fellows {{from the point of}} view of a philanthropist? Do you suppose that the man, into whose soul the irons of {{bitterness}} have gnawed and eaten their way, is likely to come out <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> and look around him for the opportunity of doing good? Rubbish! My aim is to encourage suffering wherever I see it, to create it where I can, to make sinners and thieves of honest people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] {{said the}} Judge, {{with a look}} that {{scarcely}} expressed approval. [...] "I guess you've been patted on the back too much by your father's friends." [...] He {{leaned back in his}} wooden chair. [...] "How I used to detest people who patted boys on the back and said <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk,</b> 'I know your father.' I never had a father whom people could say that about. But, sir," [...] cried the Judge, bringing down his fist on the litter of papers that covered his desk, [...] "I made up my mind that one day people should know me. That was my spur. And you'll start fair here, Mr. Brice. They won't know your father here--" ...|$|E
60|$|Then if {{we could}} follow him, we might see him reach his Belgravian mansion, and fling an angry word to his wife as she sits alone in the darkling drawing-room, poring over the embers. He will ask her, {{probably}} with an oath, why the ---- she is not dressed? and if she always intends to keep her company waiting? An hour hence, each <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk,</b> and the lady in smart raiment, with flowers in her hair, will be greeting their guests as they arrive. Then will come dinner and such conversation as it brings. Then at night Sir Barnes will issue forth, cigar in mouth; {{to return to his}} own chamber at his own hour; to breakfast by himself; to go Citywards, money-getting. He will see his children once a fortnight, and exchange a dozen sharp words with his wife twice in that time.|$|E
5000|$|Bruce {{was born}} in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh in Scotland. He was born John Charles Young, but adopted the stage name of Robert the Bruce, later {{shortened}} to Robert Bruce, and kept the name when he quit wrestling. In the ring he played the quintessential villain who prefaced every low blow <b>with</b> <b>an</b> evil <b>smirk,</b> once saying [...] "Honestly, it's better being a bad guy. I suppose it's the underlying evil you may have. You {{get a lot more}} fun." ...|$|R
60|$|The manager bustled off, and Bugs Butler, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> final <b>smirk,</b> left Sally and dived {{under the}} ropes. There was a stir of {{interest}} in the audience, though the newspaper men, blasé through familiarity, exhibited no emotion. Presently Mr. Burrowes reappeared, shepherding a young man whose face was hidden by the sweater which he was pulling over his head. He was a sturdily built young man. The sweater, moving from his body, revealed a good pair of shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Jill was too {{astonished}} to speak. Plainly Uncle Chris {{had made no}} mention of the change in her fortunes, and this man looked on her as a girl of wealth. She could only think how typical this was of Uncle Chris. There was a sort of boyish impishness about him. She could see him at the telephone, suave and important. He would have hung up the receiver <b>with</b> <b>a</b> complacent <b>smirk,</b> thoroughly satisfied that he had done her an excellent turn.|$|R
60|$|All this while, however, {{there was}} a more {{poisonous}} ferment at work between the two lads, which came late indeed to the surface, but had modified and magnified their dissensions from the first. To an idle, shallow, easy-going customer like Frank, the smell of a mystery was attractive. It gave his mind something to play with, like a new toy to a child; and it took him on the weak side, for like many young men coming to the Bar, and before they had been tried and found wanting, he flattered himself he was a fellow of unusual quickness and penetration. They knew nothing of Sherlock Holmes in those days, but {{there was a}} good deal said of Talleyrand. And if you could have caught Frank off his guard, he would have confessed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> that, if he resembled any one, it was the Marquis de Talleyrand-Perigord. It was on the occasion of Archie’s first absence that this interest took root. It was vastly deepened when Kirstie resented his curiosity at breakfast, and that same afternoon there occurred another scene which clinched the business. He was fishing Swingleburn, Archie accompanying him, when the latter looked at his watch.|$|E
6000|$|At last we {{set forth}} for Silverado on foot. Kelmar and his jolly Jew girls {{were full of}} the {{sentiment}} of Sunday outings, breathed geniality and vagueness, and suffered a little vile boy from the hotel to lead them here and there about the woods. For three people all so old, so bulky in body, and belonging to a race so venerable, they could not but surprise us by their extreme and almost imbecile youthfulness of spirit. They were only going to stay ten minutes at the Toll House; had they not twenty long miles of road before them on the other side? Stay to dinner? Not they! Put up the horses? Never. Let us attach them to the verandah by a wisp of straw rope, such as would not have held a person's hat on that blustering day. And with all these protestations of hurry, they proved irresponsible like children. Kelmar himself, shrewd old Russian Jew, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> that seemed just to have concluded a bargain to its satisfaction, intrusted himself and us devoutly to that boy. Yet the boy was patently fallacious; {{and for that matter}} a most unsympathetic urchin, raised apparently on gingerbread. He was bent on his own pleasure, nothing else; and Kelmar followed him to his ruin, with the same shrewd smirk. If the boy said there was [...] "a hole there in the hill"--a hole, pure and simple, neither more nor less--Kelmar and his Jew girls would follow him a hundred yards to look complacently down that hole. For two hours we looked for houses; and for two hours they followed us, smelling trees, picking flowers, foisting false botany on the unwary. Had we taken five, with that vile lad to head them off on idle divagations, for five they would have smiled and stumbled through the woods.|$|E
50|$|Beau's camel, {{named after}} a famous aeroplane. Sopwith is {{seemingly}} intelligent and understands what Beau is saying to him, and Sopwith stubbornly refuses to obey any command given to him. Sopwith will often deliberately throw Beau off his back, or spit in his face whilst Beau is attempting to talk down to the animal. After such acts, Sopwith can often be seen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> on his face.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} scene, Tramell pays {{a visit to}} Glass at a local mental {{hospital}} {{where he has been}} institutionalised, and he learns from her that the subject of her latest best-selling novel was a man very much like him. Tramell claims that she manipulated Glass into committing all those murders for her own amusement, and flashbacks are shown of Glass committing the murders. Tramell leaves <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wicked <b>smirk</b> on her face, while Glass continues to sit silently in his wheelchair, stymied by frustration and rage.|$|R
6000|$|The {{brass band}} within {{wrenched}} and blared into {{the tune of}} [...] "The Girl I Left behind Me." [...] Chafing, pawing, snorting, my steed, with its rider, paused in the entry. Then <b>with</b> <b>a</b> last <b>smirk</b> of encouragement from the gipsy woman, the rein was loosed, I bowed my head, and the next moment, {{as if in a}} floating vat of light, I found myself cantering wellnigh soundlessly round the ring, its circumference thronged tier above tier in the smoke-laden air with ghost-white rings of faces.|$|R
500|$|... "Have a nice day" [...] is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} Israeli retail and service industries. Jerry Levin wrote in his 2005book West Bank Diary: Middle East Violence as Reported by a Former American Hostage about {{a woman in a}} coffee shop telling him to [...] "have a nice day" [...] after he purchased a sweet roll and coffee. Levin stated that there is also a [...] "grimmer version of the pervasive pleasantry". After an Israeli soldier destroyed the memory card of Levin's camera, the soldier told him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> jocular <b>smirk,</b> [...] "have <b>a</b> nice day".|$|R
50|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Detective Morton {{receives}} a letter from Mexico - it's a Polaroid from the dinner party of Warwick and John together. A suspicious Morton confronts Warwick, who blows it off; but, when Morton persists, Warwick invites Morton to a dinner party and asks what type of wine he would like. Warwick then {{walks out of the}} office - along with his imaginary friends - <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> on his face.|$|E
50|$|Karl is {{a middle-aged}} man that looks after Spot and lets him stay in his aquarium. Karl usually acts as the {{straight}} man for Spot's and Buddy's antics, knowing the flaws in the frogs' thoughts, but willing to play along with them anyway. Even on the rare occasion when he does question one of their ideas, he does so <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> and a raised eyebrow, more interested in their response than anything else.|$|E
5000|$|At this point, Riddler {{announces that}} Batman is {{en route to}} their very location, {{something}} both Conundrum and the writer have difficulty believing. Riddler claims that since his reform, he and Batman have become close, and that his cane now has its own GPS that alerts Batman to his location whenever the question mark is twisted. Noting her disbelief, Riddler calmly asks Conundrum <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smirk,</b> [...] "Why is this man smiling?".|$|E
2500|$|At The Dragon's shop, the Dragon hears his windchimes ring as a dark lime smoke enters. The smoke {{takes the}} form of the Evil Queen, {{something}} that does not surprise him. The Evil Queen tells the Dragon that he was right about one thing: there was a battle raging within Regina. She then laughs that Regina should have never let her out to play. Now that she's out, there's going to be <b>a</b> war. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>smirk,</b> she rips out the Dragon's heart, but doesn't crush it. Grinning, she declares, [...] "The Queen is back." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then {{we had an}} {{opportunity}} of seeing some of the civilians of the town. Three or four ladies passed, with fan and mantle; to them came three or four dandies, dressed smartly in the French fashion, with strong Jewish physiognomies. There was one, a solemn lean fellow in black, with his collars extremely turned over, and holding before him a long ivory-tipped ebony cane, who tripped along the little place <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solemn <b>smirk,</b> which gave one an indescribable feeling of the truth of [...] "Gil Blas," [...] and of those delightful bachelors and licentiates who have appeared to us all in our dreams.|$|R
