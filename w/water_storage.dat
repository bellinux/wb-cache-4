Microlayer and subsurface samples were taken from eight <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) used to quantify HS concentration. The E 2 /E 3 ratio (ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm) was used to indicate the molecular weight of DOC compounds, and absorbance at 253. 7 nm and the permanganate index were used to compare the reactivity of humified DOC. The concentration of carbonyl compounds in the microlayer was also investigated as carbonyls are considered the most photoreactive functional group present in HS. Preliminary results indicate that the concentration of humic substances and their chemical reactivity in SEQ <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> are highly variable, reflecting the characteristics of the water catchments...|$|R

The Long Hill Road pump house is the primary water supply for the village with supply capacity exceeding 3.5 million gallons per day (MGD). Briarcliff Manor's average daily water supply demand is 1.45 MGD with a peak demand of 3.5 MGD. Briarcliff Manor has four <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> tanks (at Rosecliff, Farm Road, the former King's College, and the Edith Macy Conference Center) and two pump stations (the Long Hill Road pump house and the Dalmeny Road pump station).|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|Further west, Typhoon Sudal {{intensified}} {{quickly as}} it moved through the Caroline Islands and later Yap state. On Ulithi, a wind gust of 132km/h (82mph) was reported, and 6.34inches of rainfall occurred in a 24‑hour period. High waves of over 5m (18ft) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built homes. On nearby Faraulep and Fais islands, similar meteorological conditions and damages were reported. The small Ngulu Atoll received gale force winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> tanks. Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind gusts of 141km/h (87mph).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> and regulation, {{the system has}} a hydroelectric capacity of over 2,000 megawatts, and provides recreation and flood control with its twenty dams and reservoirs. It has allowed major cities to grow along Valley rivers which previously would flood each spring, and transformed the semi-arid desert environment of the San Joaquin Valley into productive farmland. Freshwater stored in Sacramento River reservoirs and released downriver during dry periods prevents salt water from intruding into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta during high tide. There are eight divisions {{of the project and}} ten corresponding units, many of which operate in conjunction, while others are independent {{of the rest of the}} network. California agriculture and related industries now directly account for 7% of the gross state product for which the CVP supplied water for about half.|$|E
5|$|The CVP {{also has}} several dams on the San Joaquin River—which has far less average flow than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to {{southern}} Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, {{is the largest}} component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses the San Joaquin River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> for San Joaquin Valley irrigators {{as well as providing}} a diversion point for a pair of canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the Chowchilla River.|$|E

5000|$|Bronte Lagoon is a {{lake that}} was created by Hydro Tasmania in the 1950s along with Bradys Lake, Lake Binney and Tungatinah Lagoon as <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> for the Tungatinah Power Station on the Nive River.|$|R
5|$|The dam was {{authorized}} in 1944 {{as a unit}} of the federal Central Valley Project, a system designed to provide irrigation water to the fertile agricultural region of the Central Valley. It would be built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), and transferred to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) upon completion. In 1966, work began to clear the foundations for a high dam that would replace an earlier, much smaller structure built by two irrigation districts. Construction of the main embankment began in 1976, and was topped out in late 1978. <b>Water</b> <b>storage</b> in New Melones Lake commenced in 1978, and the dam's hydroelectric station produced its first power in mid-1979.|$|E
5|$|The dams on the Willamette's major tributaries are {{primarily}} large flood-control, <b>water</b> <b>storage,</b> and power-generating dams. Thirteen of these dams were built from the 1940s through the 1960s {{to be operated}} by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and 11 of those produce hydropower. Flood-control dams operated by the USACE are estimated to hold up to 27percent of the Willamette's runoff. They are used to regulate river flows so as to cut peaks off floods and increase low flows in late summer and autumn, and to divert water into deeper, narrower channels to prevent flooding. In addition, a relatively small of amount of the water stored in the reservoirs is used for irrigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. <b>Water</b> <b>storage</b> in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in 2010 and 2011 {{has increased}} Melbourne's <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> to levels not seen for ten years. The Thomson Dam entered winter 2011 at 39% {{full and by}} the end of 2011 had reached 54.4% full.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after being}} commissioned, {{rainfall}} and <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> increased in south east Queensland. Three major storages, Wivenhoe, Somerset Dam and North Pine dams, approached 80% of capacity in mid-2009 and reached 100% {{by the end}} of 2010.|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} for a desalination plant was promoted through the late 2000s {{in response to an}} increasingly severe drought which saw Melbourne's <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> go from 57.1 per cent of capacity in January 2005 to 28.7 per cent in June 2007.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for <b>water</b> <b>storage.</b> Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
5|$|The Kalimpong municipality, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1945, {{is in charge of}} the infrastructure of the town such as potable water and roads. The municipal area is divided into twenty-three wards. Kalimpong municipality is constructing additional <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> tanks to meet the requirement of potable water, and it needs an increase of water supply from the 'Neora Khola Water Supply Scheme' for this purpose. Often, landslides occurring in monsoon season cause havoc to the roads in and around Kalimpong. The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (WBSEDCL) that provides electricity here, needs to resolve issues like voltage fluctuations, unstable electrical supply and faulty electrical meters etc. faced by people of Kalimpong. Renewable Energy Development Agency of the state has plans to promote usage of solar street lights in Kalimpong and proposed an energy park here to sell renewable energy gadgets. The Public Works Department is responsible for the road connecting the town to the National Highway–NH-31A. The Kalimpong municipality has a total of 10 health care units, with a total of 433 bed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{studies for}} {{irrigation}} in the Plain {{were conducted by}} the United States Geological Survey in the late 19thcentury, and the project was authorized on April23, 1904. The first dam constructed for the project was Minidoka Dam in 1904; its power plant began operating in 1909, producing 7MW of electricity. This capacity was revised to 20MW in 1993. However, Minidoka Dam {{was not the only}} dam constructed for the project. As far upstream as Jackson Lake in Wyoming, the Jackson Lake Dam was built in 1907 to raise the lake level for providing additional <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> for dry years. American Falls Dam, upstream of Minidoka, was completed in 1927 and replaced in 1978. As the dams were constructed above Shoshone Falls, the historical upriver limit of salmon and also a total barrier to boats and ships, no provisions were made for fish passage or navigation. Several other irrigation dams were also built - including Twin Falls Dam and Palisades Dam.|$|E
