40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{behaviour}} of a falling apron made from 'poorly sorted' material. It is a follow-up of a report, which was made by a Dutch student, Marc van der Hoeven, with the title: "The behaviour of a falling apron". In {{the end of the}} last century a complex river training work had to be done in con- nection with the construction of the Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh crossing one of the largest rivers of the world. The Jamuna River has a strong changing character and the morphological behaviour is difficult to predict. By means of two banana-formed guide bunds the span of the bridge could be reduced from 15 km to 5 km. The constriction forced to an additional protection of the guide bunds. At the toe loose rock material was dumped, which 'fall' down' and covers the slope when erosion occurs. This is the reason why this kind of exibel protection is called 'falling apron'. In the previous study from Marc van der Hoeven only 'well sorted' material was used for the experiments, material with a narrow grading. In reality these falling aprons are made from material with a <b>wide</b> <b>grading,</b> called 'poorly sorted' material. For this reason a further study was demanded from the contractor Ballast-Ham-Dredging from the Netherlands. The experiments in a flume were mainly done with the aim to get information about the setting process of a falling apron, to determine the angle of the slope and the thickness of the protective layer after a ow attack. In two experiments it was found that the developing slope angle was approximately 1 : 2 and the setting process was evenly spread over the entire slope. A layer with an average thickness of the characteristic stone diameter of D 50 protected the emerging slope. This single layer does not stop the erosion, but it slows down the scour development and this even better in comparison to the 'well sorted' material. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Construction of breakwaters is {{performed}} consecutively from core layer, filter layer, {{up to the}} armour layer. During construction, excessive damage is often encountered on core layers due to environmental conditions. The damage behaviour of core layers is similar to berm breakwater structures, where the initial profile is reshaped into a more stable S-shaped profile in response to environmental loads. In addition, when breakwaters are exposed to oblique waves, longshore transport occurs due to wave force components parallel to the structure alignment. Many researchers have studied the behaviour of profile reshaping and longshore transport on berm breakwaters. Nevertheless, very little information is available about the behaviour of core materials. Most of the studies also focused on investigating the behaviour of breakwater trunks (the straight part of breakwaters), and not much {{is known about the}} behaviour of breakwater roundheads. To investigate the behaviour of berm breakwater roundheads that consist of core materials, a physical model was performed in the Hydraulic Laboratory at Delft University of Technology. The model is exposed to two different wave loads (H_s= 8 cm; 10 cm); two different stones grading, which is narrow (D_n 85 ?(D_n 15 = 1. 3)), and <b>wide</b> <b>grading</b> (D_n 85 ?(D_n 15 = 6)); and three different wave obliquities (0 °, 30 °, and 45 °). In total, twelve tests were performed based on a combination of the above mentioned parameters. During the tests, the data and profile changes were measured using laser profiling, video recording, and manual measurements. The result of laser profiling is then processed using MATLAB software to obtain 3 -Dimensional plots that represent the breakwater models. Based on the 3 -dimensional plots, the analysis of profile reshaping and longshore transport could be performed. Several profile reshaping parameters, such as crest recession length (Rec), crest length (l_c), step length (l_s), crest height (h_c), step height (h_s), and slope below crest (?_ 3) were measured and then compared with the calculated values using existing design formulas. The measured values in roundheads were also compared to the measured values in trunk sections. The effect of stone grading, wave loads, and wave obliquity were also investigated. Finally, a model to calculate the longshore transport on berm breakwater roundheads is proposed.

40|$|Breakwaters under {{construction}} {{are prone to}} undesired deformation because the breakwater core is not designed to withstand severe or moderate wave loads. The reshaping mechanisms for a complete (finished) breakwater have been comprehensively studied; however, few research studies have been undertaken to analyze the deformation mechanisms of the breakwater core (or a breakwater {{under construction}}). It is imperative for the contractor {{to understand how the}} reshaping takes place because reshaping requires construction schedules to be adjusted as well as additional material and therefore, additional costs. The present study focusses on the deformation rubble mound breakwater roundheads undergo during the construction phase. Mulders (2010) performed physical model tests for breakwaters under construction exposed to wave attack. To investigate the deformation processes, twelve scaled physical model tests were performed by varying the wave height (8 cm for low and 10 cm for high wave heights), wave angle (0 °, 30 °, and 45 °), and material grading (fg= 1. 3 for narrow and fg= 6 for <b>wide</b> <b>grading).</b> The data from Mulders’ tests was used in this study to analyze the breakwater deformation, with emphasis on the roundheads, via volumetric changes (initial and final test conditions) for a given control volume. The control volumes included the overwash, the overall breakwater, and the roundheads using radial and angular sectioning methods. The radial sections depicted the cross-shore transport while the angular sections illustrated the longshore sediment transport at the roundheads. As expected, the overwash volumes were proportional to wave load and angle of wave attack. Regarding the breakwater overall behavior, wide graded material caused a volume increase due to the transverse movement of the coarse fractions while the narrow graded material (fine fraction) decreased in volume thus, increasing the packing density. This sorting mechanism was also noticeably present in the roundheads for the radial sections. For the roundheads, distinctive percentage losses (sectors with low resistance to wave loading) were clearly present in the radial sectors; thus, transverse (radially outward) sediment transport was the dominant deformation mechanism over longshore transport. Longshore transport did contribute to roundhead deformation; however, no maximum losses were found because the volume losses were nearly equal throughout the angular sectors. As a result, the angle of wave incidence did not affect the volume losses in the angular direction. With regards to material sorting at the roundheads, wide graded material caused a volume increase at the outer radii due to the transverse movement of the coarsest fraction potentially reducing the packing density. On the other hand, grading did not influence the roundhead negative percent changes in the radial direction; thus, grading appeared to be indifferent to volume losses but relevant for volume gains.

40|$|During the {{construction}} of breakwaters contractors often encounter undesired reshaping of exposed core material. This reshaping {{is comparable to the}} deformation process of berm breakwaters in which the outer profile reshapes into a more stable s-curve. In the case of oblique waves this deformation is enhanced by a longshore transport of stones leading to even more loss of material and damage. Throughout the years few formulas were derived for both processes which describe the behaviour of berm breakwaters as well as gravel beaches reasonably well. These formulas however turned out to be inadequate when it comes to describing the behaviour of core material. In particular the influence of the <b>wide</b> <b>grading</b> of quarry run, commonly used as core material, is to a large extent unknown and generally not described in the available relations. To investigate this influence of the stone grading on both the two-dimensional deformation and longshore transport new physical model tests were carried out in the wave basin at Delft University of Technology. In total 12 tests were executed in which two different gradings, three different angles of wave attack and two different wave spectra were tested. Data collected from the tests included wave and profile measurements together with the displacements of stones, originating from two colour beams which were applied {{in the middle of the}} trunk. These data along with visual observations eventually led to a conceptual model describing stone movements in both transverse and longshore direction. Using Matlab three-dimensional profile and erosion models were generated from which the different profile parameters were determined. With respect to the distance from origin, for each test an exponential relation was derived to describe the stone displacements. After determination of the area of uniform transport these exponential relations were used to calculate the total longshore transport by means of extrapolation and multiple integrations. Subsequently all parameters found were compared to the formulas currently available for both processes. Regarding the deformation parameters the test results produced the best fit with the formulas derived in [MERLI 2009]. Still on several occasions a deviant relation was found concerning the influence of wave obliquity. In addition, the formulas became less accurate for the narrow grading used in the tests, which fell outside the range tested by Merli. However, for the crest height of the deformed profile test results deviated completely from the available formula as no influence was found whatsoever for all tested parameters. Here the deviation was contributed to a higher instability of the part above the initial deformation, partly due to the steepness of the slope. On the subject of the longshore transport clear trends were found describing the influence of the varying parameters. Both a higher wave load and wider grading lead to an increase of the longshore transport. For the wider grading, however, this increase gave a rather distorted image, as not all fractions in the mixture were transported evenly. Due to segregation the coarsest fractions were mostly transported in the transverse direction while the finer fractions were transported further away in the longitudinal direction. Alternatively, computation of the longshore volume transport proved to be more representative. Regarding the effect of wave obliquity an increase in angle of wave attack of 30 to 45 degrees was accompanied by a decrease in longshore transport; though this decrease was less than already available formulas indicated. However despite the fact that it describes a completely different trend concerning this particular influence, the best fit was found after multiplying the relation derived by [ALIKHANI 1996] with a factor 100.
