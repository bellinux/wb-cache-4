5|$|Hibiki is a {{young girl}} with little {{confidence}} in her abilities, except in tea making. When she met Shirotsuki, Hibiki was a shy girl who would hide {{in the corner of}} a room in his house speechlessly. Eventually, Hibiki warmed up to Shirotsuki's affectionate personality and came to consider him a very important person. Hibiki can be very lighthearted, and always helps people <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> She has no talent for magic, and relies on her master to help her in this regard. She is a crybaby and somewhat clumsy, but does her best and wins people over with her abundant kindness and warm heart.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
25|$|Catholic social {{teaching}} {{is based on}} the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others, to give advice to those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give correction to those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> and pray for the living and the dead. The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, however, is performed by a priest, who will anoint with oil the head and hands of the ill person and pray a special prayer for them while laying on hands.|$|E

Some critics also fear that the movement will prevent autistic children from receiving important therapies.

It currently funds three 'bobby vans' that serve as mobile workshops to the three operators, who are trained locksmiths, carpenters, crime reduction officers and fire risk assessors. The operators travel around the county installing equipment to those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> free of charge.

Maternal and child healthcare (MCH) {{is a priority}} for UNRWA's health programme. School health teams and camp medical officers visit UNRWA schools to examine new pupils to aid early detection of childhood diseases. All UNRWA clinics offer family planning services with counselling that emphasises the importance of birth spacing {{as a factor in}} maternal and child health. Agency clinics also supervise the provision of food aid to nursing and pregnant mothers <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> and six clinics in the Gaza Strip have their own maternity units. Infant mortality rates have for some time been lower among refugees than the World Health Organisation's benchmark for the developing world.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{nutrition}} {{are some of}} the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding. In young children, providing food (in addition to breastmilk) between six months and two years of age improves outcomes. There is also good evidence supporting the supplementation of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world. To get food to people <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> most, both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective. Simply feeding students at school is insufficient. Management of severe malnutrition within the person's home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods is possible much of the time. In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems, treatment in a hospital setting is recommended. This often involves managing low blood sugar and body temperature, addressing dehydration, and gradual feeding. Routine antibiotics are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection. Longer-term measures include: improving agricultural practices, reducing poverty, improving sanitation, and the empowerment of women.|$|E

Rob Keyes of GameRant said that when compared to the previous iterations, the Naga 2014 has better buttons and is more user-friendly. He recommended the mouse to people who liked the previous iterations and to people who wish to have better control in MMOs. Marshall Honorof said the mouse is guaranteed to appeal to MMO fans, but isn't very useful for other genres.|$|E
