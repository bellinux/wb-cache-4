5|$|On June 28, Washington {{learned that}} the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were heading toward New York. On June 29, signals were sent from men {{stationed}} on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic {{at the sight of the}} British ships; alarms <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|Masterson {{was back}} in Denver on April 6, 1897, serving as a deputy sheriff of Arapahoe County, when he got into an election-day dispute with a man named Tim Connors. Masterson drew his pistol and Connors {{attempted}} to seize it. During the scuffle, the gun <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> a man named C.C. Louderbaugh {{was shot in the}} left wrist.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 2012 around 6:25 hours local time, {{an alarm}} <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> the cooling {{system of the}} spent fuel pool halted. At that time, the {{temperature}} was 33.3 degrees Celsius; no leakage of radioactive contaminated water was reported. On 4 June, a similar situation caused the cooling to be halted. On 1 July shortly after 3 p.m. the cooling was resumed, the water temperature of the pool having risen to 42.9°C. TEPCO had feared that the temperature could reach 65°C, the upper limit designated in safety regulations. The cause of the troubles was laid {{in some parts of}} the emergency power system, and these were to be replaced.|$|E

25|$|For 2007, Sébastien Loeb {{returned}} {{as an official}} Citroën driver, with the new Citroën C4 WRC. He won the 75ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo, the first race for the new C4, following that with a solid second place after Grönholm, in Sweden, to set a two-point lead over the Finn after two of 16 rounds. At the first Rally Norway, Loeb <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> lost eight minutes during SS12 while chasing Grönholm and the leader, Mikko Hirvonen. On the next stage, he made another mistake and lost nine minutes. He eventually finished 14th in the rally and dropped to third in the championship standings. He won 8 of the 18 stages in this rally. Loeb won the next rally, the 21º Corona Rally México, 55.8 seconds clear of Grönholm.|$|E
25|$|During the Paitilla Airfield operation, another Navy SEAL group, {{consisting}} of four divers and men on Zodiac attack boats, {{was assigned to}} sabotage Noriega's heavily armed gunboat, Presidente Porras, while it was tied to a pier on the canal. The plan called for the divers to plant explosives {{on the bottom of}} the boat, using Draeger rebreathers, which do not give off exhalation bubbles, for added secrecy. The divers were transported by several combat rubber raiding craft to an insertion point located in a grove of mangrove trees roughly one hundred fifty yards away from the target. The divers entered the water and approached the boat in separate pairs, attached the explosives, and began exfiltrating. As they were leaving, several PDF guards began dropping grenades and shooting into the water, forcing the SEALs to take cover under the pier. Due to this diversion, the divers were still in the area when the bombs <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> were able to confirm that the ship was destroyed. As the divers were heading back to the rendezvous point, they heard a large ship approaching overhead, and were forced to descend to forty feet, dangerous due to the increased toxicity of the pure oxygen used in the Draeger at greater pressures. However, no divers experienced any ill effects, and both pairs were picked up by several raiding craft, and were transported back to Rodman Naval Base.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} Easter Cup final at Shelbourne {{and won the}} Spring Cup final at Harold's Cross Stadium and National Cup final at Shelbourne before {{travelling}} to England for the first time. In a solo trial prior to the 1929 English Greyhound Derby on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win {{by the time of}} the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby. In the first round, Mick pulled away down the back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the dog would win on the night, which at the time was more than the cost of buying a house in nearby Shepherd's Bush. By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race klaxon <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a handkerchief soaked in cold water.|$|E

At one point, Benoit applied a crossface submission hold on Grenier. Kane's pyrotechnics <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> {{made his way to}} the ring, as he entered the ring and delivered a Big Boot to Benoit, prompting the referee to end the match in a disqualification, thus La Résistance retained the World Tag Team title.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 4:30pm the twister, which witnesses {{described as}} a [...] "mass of blowing dust" [...] or [...] "rolling fog bank" [...] entered Comfrey, a town of 550people located in both Cottonwood and Brown Counties. Comfrey's fire chief saw the tornado while storm spotting and ordered the town's sirens activated. The tornado moved {{through the center of}} Comfrey one minute after the sirens <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> destroyed a grain elevator, the town hall, three of the town's four churches, the grocery store, and most of the main street businesses downtown. The town's firehouse collapsed, and the school was heavily damaged. Of the 200houses in the town, all but 15suffered damage. Fifty of those homes were destroyed and as a result 100people were left homeless. Approximately 75% of the buildings in Comfrey were damaged or destroyed.|$|E
500|$|During the {{backwards}} guitar solo, Frusciante {{was filmed}} waving a large aluminum ribbon; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui's {{desire for the}} guitarist to do so, believing he would tell the director [...] "'Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your French ass, buddy' but [...] gladly <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> made love to the air with this dancing ribbon. He would have danced around for hours with that thing." [...] The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo. While some of the scenes in the video were planned with a storyboard, {{much of it was}} improvised or made up on the spot over the two-day shoot. During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics, which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video. Where the video begins in {{what appears to be the}} daytime, it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun.|$|E

500|$|After the race, Sebastian Vettel criticised Lewis Hamilton {{for what}} he {{believed}} was excessive low speed at the restart after the safety car period, calling his behaviour [...] "ridiculous". He added: [...] "There {{was no reason to}} go that slow. If you want to pack up the field you can do it earlier and not in the very last bit." [...] Following his 46G impact on Saturday, Carlos Sainz conceded that he felt [...] "a bit of dizziness" [...] {{in the early stages of}} the Grand Prix, though he added: [...] "But after lap 10 it <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> I could push normally without problems." [...] After his accident on lap twelve, Romain Grosjean spoke of his [...] "biggest impact for quite a while". He also revealed that the seat of his car broke at impact, but also emphasised the fact that he was able to escape unharmed: [...] "It's a testament to all the safety inherent in the car and the other safety devices." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{began work}} on her first novel, An Ordinary Lunacy, {{relatively}} late in life: she started writing in her late thirties, and it was published only in 1963, by which time she was aged 47. Although it began life as a radio play, Anderson quickly found that An Ordinary Lunacy was [...] "interesting enough for a novel, so I <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> it got quite out of hand." [...] The novel detailed the romance between thirty-five-year-old Sydney barrister, David Byfield, and Isobel Purdy, a woman accused of murdering her husband. Acclaimed for its adept portrayal of the protean nature of romantic love, An Ordinary Lunacy foregrounds the different perspectives of three women: Isobel, Daisy Byfield (David's mother), and Myra Magaskill, David's ex-lover. Pam Gilbert writes that [...] "Anderson's construction of the tensions existing between three women such as Daisy, Isobel and Myra offers an interesting platform for an exposition of romance and passion from a woman's perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> did other things." ...|$|E
