5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Caracalla's death, Adventus was selected to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age. The army then chose Macrinus; they had no feelings of 'love or esteem' towards him, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> competing for the position. The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla, and named him Augustus.|$|E

The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.|$|E

500|$|The {{night before}} the National League playoffs began, Manager Walter Alston asked Koufax if he could start the first game the next day. With an overworked {{pitching}} staff, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else,</b> as Don Drysdale and Johnny Podres had pitched the prior two days. Koufax obliged. Koufax later said, [...] "I had nothing at all." [...] He was knocked out in the second inning, after giving up home runs to Hall of Famer Willie Mays and Jim Davenport. After winning the second game of the series, the Dodgers blew a 4–2 lead {{in the ninth inning}} of the deciding third game, losing the pennant.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> for me... second best is no good for me... I would have liked a wife and family, {{but it was not}} to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 he said to the Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E
500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else,</b> except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Chrysostom (347–407) defended {{perpetual}} virginity on {{a number}} of grounds, one of which was Jesus' commands to his mother in Calvary: [...] "Woman, behold your son!"

2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic {{and there was a}} sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, a {{newspaper}} reported that [...] "the former invincible Cranston" [...] was not {{playing to the}} level he had in 1889 -- [...] "The old men, instead of improving with age, are rather deteriorating {{in the quality of}} their play." [...] The New York Tribune offered a more positive take on Cranston in November 1890:"John Cranston, the Crimson's center rusher, {{is one of the oldest}} and strongest men on either team. He has played four years on the Harvard team, becoming center rusher in his freshman year. He played a right guard in the two following years, but returned to his old place, because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> to fill the old place. Cranston is aggressive and active and always gives his opponent a great deal of work." [...] The Springfield Republican wrote that Cranston was not a great blocker and [...] "is rather pugnacious and wastes time splitting heads; but he is a strong, heavy man, and will do his part very nearly as it ought to be done." [...] At the end of the 1890 season, Cranston was again selected for [...] on the College Football All-America Team, this time as the center. In 1891, The New York Times reported that Cranston had left Harvard:"Cranston is another man who will be missed. Year before last he played in the center but last year he was the left guard. Late in the Spring Cranston withdrew from college, and in all probability will not enter Harvard again. Although his game last year was not up to his usual standard, he was an extremely valuable man." ...|$|E
