On 11 September 2008, NDP leader Jack Layton also criticized the Green Shift, saying that it would hurt consumers, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a nuisance for energy producers, and evaluates emission equally across all sectors instead of maximizing reductions where the cost is lowest. Layton further noted that Dion's proposal does not set a target for reducing emissions.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{existence}} of dictionaries and encyclopedias spanned into ancient times, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> new to Enlightenment readers, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century encyclopedic dictionaries. The works {{were part of an}} Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the educated elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers’ tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on secular affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of theology.|$|E

25|$|The {{cities of}} Ionia worshipped the Spartan general Lysander, when he {{personally}} dominated Greece, {{immediately following the}} Peloponnesian War; according to Plutarch, {{this was the first}} instance of ruler cult in Greek history. There were similar instances of divine cult to humans in the same century, although some rulers, like Agesilaus, declined it. Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea, dressed up like Zeus and claimed godhood; this did not stop the Heracleots from assassinating him. Isocrates said of Philip II of Macedon that after he conquered the Persian Empire, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> for him to attain but to become a god; the city of Amphipolis, and a private society at Athens, worshiped him even without this conquest; he himself set out his statue, dressed as a god, as the thirteenth of the Twelve Olympians.|$|E
25|$|PFC Carlos James Lozada was {{assigned}} to Co. A, 2nd Battalion, 503 Infantry, 173rd Airborne Brigade. On November 20, 1967, at Dak To, Lozada spotted a North Vietnamese Army company rapidly approaching his outpost. He alerted his comrades and opened fire with a machine gun, killing at least twenty enemy soldiers and disrupting their initial attack. He realized that if he abandoned his position there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to hold back the}} surging North Vietnamese soldiers and that his entire company withdrawal would be jeopardized - as a result he told his comrades to move to the back and that he would supply cover for them. He continued to deliver a heavy and accurate volume of suppressive fire against the enemy until he was mortally wounded and had to be carried during the withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|The Russians had {{advanced}} considerably {{but they had}} also gained the long and vulnerable coastline with it. After the sea would be clear of ice there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> to prevent Swedish forces from landing troops on the shore. With the Royal Navy supporting the Swedish battle fleet there was little the Russian battle fleet could accomplish. Capture of {{the main body of}} the Swedish archipelago fleet had resulted in a real advantage to the Russians since it allowed them to gain superiority in the narrow waters of the Finnish archipelago where large ships of the line could not operate. Even the powerful explosion at Sveaborg which destroyed several of the captured ships did little to change Russian superiority in the Finnish archipelago. The Russians utilized the guns from the burned ships, and of those which burned during the winter, and constructed several fortifications on the coast, both in Hangö as well as along narrow passages leading to Åbo.|$|E

25|$|The {{news that}} Louis XIV had {{accepted}} Charles II's will {{and that the}} Second Partition Treaty was dead was a personal blow to William III, who had concluded that Philip V <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a French puppet. However, in England many argued that the acceptance of Charles II's will was preferable to a treaty that would have extended French territory, including the addition of Naples and Sicily, which under French control would {{pose a threat to}} England's Levantine trade. After the exertions of the Nine Years' War the Tory-dominated House of Commons was keen to prevent further conflict and restore normal commercial activity. Yet to William III, France's growing strength made war inevitable, and together with Anthonie Heinsius, Grand Pensionary of Holland and de facto executive head of the Dutch state once William had been crowned King of England in 1689, he made preparations to gain support. To this end, William III was aided by Louis XIV's own actions, which fatally compromised the position of advantage the French king held.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, the {{bankrupt}} Volare Group (Volareweb, Air Europe) {{was put up}} for sale. Alitalia bid to buy the group (other bidders were Air One and Meridiana/Eurofly). Air One went to court claiming that Alitalia could not buy Volare Group as it had received state aid in the past. The TAR (Regional Administrative Tribunal) of Lazio tried to block Alitalia's acquisition of Volare Group but abandoned the attempt, claiming that Alitalia had repaid its €400 million loan and so there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> stopping it from buying Volare Group. Air One also went to court, unsuccessfully. Alitalia created Volare SpA to buy the Volare Group. The airlines were becoming closer and Volare Group had started providing soft maintenance services for some Alitalia aircraft in Milan Malpensa airport. However, the Italian Consiglio di Stato (State Council) on 23 May 2006 has once again blocked the acquisition of the airline. It {{is not clear what}} is going to happen as Volare is in serious financial difficulties. On 2 November 2006 TAR court decided that the administrative procedure used by the Italian government to sell Volare to Alitalia was invalid but the selling contract is still valid because the administrative court was declared incompetent about this topic. If Air One wants to obtain Volare it will have to go to the local civil court and ask it to declare that the selling contract is invalid. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).|$|E

500|$|Music halls, {{where both}} Nan and Kitty are employed—and put on display—as male impersonators, allow {{about half the}} novel's action and {{commentary}} on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers {{for the first time}} to perform as Kitty's partner and realises the impact of their double act together, she states, [...] "whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy". Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London [...] "swells": gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves. Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Wohlwend mocked up a 2D {{course in}} grayscale, with humps of mountains. He {{originally}} designed the visuals such that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> {{on the screen}} where the player had not painted, which was later cut. After seeing Boxleiter's draft, he used crisp colors to make distinct gate markers and made the foreground highly contrast with the background. Their early drafts had a nighttime theme and included an aurora that was later cut due to difficulty of implementation in Flash. Wohlwend left the character design for last as his [...] "weak point". Boxleiter was particularly inspired {{by the idea of}} a skier replacing the snowmobile, and set up the parallax scrolling and motion blur, which made the skier appear to go faster. He also added the [...] "tunnel" [...] idea as a series of gates. They animated the skier, who they gave an [...] "ego-tastic" [...] large head on a stick figure body, and decided to not use tutorials, opting for a game that began with the player's first click. Wohlwend's rainbow trail effect was added as a scarf or cape (which later became a rainbow burst behind the player), and the scoring mechanics were refined to reward players who took risks by letting the skier fly through the air without touching the screen. This was partly inspired by the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. The title refers to a combination of solipsism and skiing.|$|E
500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I can tell you is it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> like anything you've seen me do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked {{for a couple of months}} to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E
