5|$|Colt was {{the first}} American {{manufacturer}} to use art as a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms in his paintings. He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers <b>with</b> <b>exotic</b> grips such as ivory or pearl to government officials. On a trip to Constantinople he gave a custom-engraved and gold inlaid revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I, informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols, thus securing a Turkish order for 5,000 pistols; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order.|$|E
5|$|Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop has 288 pages, {{including}} 32 {{pages of}} photographs of the musician. The author compares Lady Gaga to Madonna, writing that both are independent and work to assert control over their futures. The book discusses Lady Gaga's early life and background, including her upbringing in a New York City household with her father, a businessman. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, from age 11 she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart high school; the same high school as Paris Hilton. Germanotta was not popular with her fellow pupils because of her experimentation <b>with</b> <b>exotic</b> dance, drugs, and bisexuality. By age 13, she had written her first song and her mother took her to nightclubs to perform at open-mic events. Germanotta gained entry to the Tisch School of the Arts in New York at age 17, but left and started using drugs while performing as a go-go dancer. After a period of difficulty with her father, she ceased this behavior pattern.|$|E
5|$|Many in the {{conservation}} movement urged {{the state to}} buy back the land, especially after the Curtiss-Wright lease was canceled. In April 1967 Penn State vacated the site and gave the reactor complex to the state. Martin Marietta departed in June 1967, and early in that same year, Pennsylvania bought the remaining land back from Curtiss-Wright for $992,500, about $811,000 more than they had sold it for in 1955. Various usage plans for the area were proposed, including: a vacation resort with a large artificial lake, motels, golf courses, and honeymoon resort; a Penn State game preserve stocked <b>with</b> <b>exotic</b> animals like bison and boar; a large youth camp for several hundred children; and a radioactive waste disposal site. By November 1967, all of the land {{was back in the}} state forests and state game lands.|$|E

5|$|The 1990s saw the {{creation}} of a number of independent publishing houses with output that competed with the giants of mainstream comics publishing, Marvel and DC. The companies included Malibu Comics, Image Comics and later, Dark Horse Comics. These companies gave greater artistic freedom to their writers and artists and chose not to ascribe to the Comics Code, allowing exploration of more mature themes. As a result, comics from these companies included a greater relative number of LGBT characters and storylines than their more traditional competitors. LGBT superhero characters include Spectral and Turbo Charge (from Malibu comics), and Promethea and Gen13's Sarah Rainmaker (both created by Wildstorm for Image Comics before being taken over by DC). Image comic's A Distant Soil, written by Colleen Doran, depicts an alien culture <b>with</b> <b>exotic</b> gender and sexual mores and gay romances that gained the series a Gaylactic Spectrum Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts <b>with</b> <b>exotic</b> species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{society was}} highly stratified. In {{a time when}} famine was commonplace and social {{hierarchies}} were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status {{in a way that}} has no equivalent today in most developed countries. According to the ideological norm, society consisted of the three estates of the realm: commoners, that is, the working classes—by far the largest group; the clergy, and the nobility. The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical, with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes, bishops and their subordinates, such as priests. One was expected to remain in one's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth. Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned <b>with</b> <b>exotic</b> spices, and displayed refined table manners; rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread, salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette. Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods.|$|E

40|$|The {{statistical}} bootstrap model (SBM) {{describes the}} decay of single, high mass, hadronic states (fireballs, clusters) into stable particles. Coupling constants B, one for each isospin multiplet of stable particles, are the only free parameter of the model. They {{are related to the}} maximum temperature parameter T/sub 0 /. The various versions of the SMB can be classified into two groups: full statistical bootstrap models and linear ones. The main results of the model are the following: i) All momentum spectra are isotropic; especially the exclusive ones are described by invariant phase space. The inclusive and semi-inclusive single-particle distributions are asymptotically of pure exponential shape; the slope is governed by T /sub 0 / only. ii) The model parameter B for pions has been obtained by fitting the multiplicity distribution in pp and pn at rest, and corresponds to T/sub 0 /= 0. 167 GeV in the full SBM <b>with</b> <b>exotics.</b> The average pi /sup -/ multiplicity for the linear and the full SBM (both <b>with</b> <b>exotics)</b> is compared <b>with</b> data on pp. (10 refs) ...|$|R

The area surrounding Nuka-World includes: Bradberton, a town built to house park employees, the defunct Nuka-World power plant, Grandchester, a haunted mansion and tourist attraction, and the Nuka-World scrapyard containing a UFO-themed carnival ride which the Hubologists are convinced is a genuine spaceship.|$|E
