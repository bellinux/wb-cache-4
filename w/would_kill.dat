It was 3:45 in the afternoon on Sunday, October 11." [...] Pardo had received many death threats, and although he initially refused protection from the government he ended up accepting it finally as the threat level increased. On the day of his death he had decided to dispatch his security and kept only one of his bodyguards as he went to his farm in the La Mesa town, near to Bogota. As he drove back to Bogota, men shot at him from another car. Although he was transported immediately to the nearby hospital, he died before he could be helped.|$|R

They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E

5|$|Bonventre {{was called}} to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He {{was picked up by}} Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> Bonventre with two more shots when they reached their destination. The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E

The doctors tried {{to tell him that}} the increased radiation dose <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> him, but he said it wouldn't, and that anyway he would die without it. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E

Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers.|$|E
5|$|As Einsatzgruppe A {{advanced}} into Lithuania, it actively recruited local nationalists and antisemitic groups. In July 1941, {{members of}} the Baltaraisciai movement joined the massacres. A pogrom in Riga in early July killed 400 Jews. Latvian nationalist Viktors Arājs and his supporters undertook a campaign of arson against synagogues. On 2 July, Einsatzgruppe A commander Stahlecker appointed Arājs to head the Arajs Kommando, a Sonderkommando of about 300 men, mostly university students. Together, Einsatzgruppe A and the Arājs Kommando killed 2,300 Jews in Riga on 6–7 July. Within six months, Arājs and his men <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> about half of Latvia's Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> him, along {{with the promise of}} hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed.

She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, she reminded {{him that he had}} married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, and she did not come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and {{her mother}} {{received}} him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens' company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without resistance {{in the middle of}} December out of fear that Charles <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary {{and her mother}}, who attended Charles's coronation, visited Louis the Great's tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services {{in order to}} bring suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> him one day, even if he had to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E
5|$|With Simmons' help, Johnson {{discovers that}} the Watchdogs have hacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list using {{tracking}} wristwatches given to all registered Inhumans. The next Inhuman {{on the list}} is J.T. James, an Inhuman with explosive abilities who spent time with Johnson {{under the influence of the}} parasitic Inhuman Hive. Johnson and Simmons remove James's wristwatch, but he betrays them to the Watchdogs with the promise that they <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> him once he helped destroy the other Inhumans—James hates himself and his Inhuman identity. Before they can investigate the Darkhold, Coulson and Mack are alerted to James's wristwatch being removed, and arrive to help Johnson and Simmons fight off the Watchdogs and arrest James.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
