5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> in Frome declined, {{although}} the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller {{than it had been}} in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Reed {{had five}} sons, {{the third of}} whom, Charles Reed (1819–81), was apprenticed in 1836 to a wool {{manufacturer}} in Leeds, Yorkshire, where he also became secretary of the local Sunday School union. Through this work he met Edward Baines, proprietor of the Leeds Mercury one of the town's two MPs. The Baines family had a strong tradition of public and political service; both of Edward Baines's sons followed him into Parliament, the elder, Matthew Talbot Baines, eventually reaching Cabinet rank. Charles Reed was attracted to the youngest Baines offspring, a daughter, Margaret, whom he married in 1844. By this time Charles had left the <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> and returned to London, where he founded his first business, a printing firm.|$|E
5|$|Poverty, {{the decline}} of the <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> in the mid-18th century, {{increased}} industrialisation, and rising food prices led to some unrest amongst the inhabitants of Frome, and there were riots during the century. By 1791, the town was described in less flattering terms than those Defoe had used 70 years earlier. In the early 19th century, plans were developed to reinvigorate the town and once again elevate it to its former position as a more important town than Bath. These plans, the idea of a local businessman, Thomas Bunn, mostly failed to come to fruition, although some public buildings were erected and a wide new approach road to the town centre from the south was cut (named Bath Street after the landowner, Lord Bath of Longleat House).|$|E
40|$|This revised book is an {{expanded}} and {{updated version of}} the Australian Sheep and Wool Handbook published in 1991 and focuses on the sheep <b>wool</b> and meat <b>industry.</b> The book is divided in 5 sections, each including several chapters written by well-known and qualified researchers and industry representatives from many countries. The first section on Major sheep and <b>wool</b> <b>industries,</b> in my opinion, is particularly interesting because it explores the sheep and <b>wool</b> <b>industries</b> of leading countries (e. g. Australia, South Africa and New Zealand) and continents (Europe and South America), and those of emerging countries (e. g. China) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} size and {{distribution}} of returns from alternative broad types of R&D and promotion investments permit strategic-level decisions about resource allocation, both within and across research programs. The Australian sheep meat and <b>wool</b> <b>industries</b> are characterised by strong cross-commodity relationships due to the joint product nature of the industries. An equilibrium displacement model of the Australian sheep meat and <b>wool</b> <b>industries</b> was developed to account for these relationships and any indirect benefits and costs arising from spill-over and feedback effects between the industries {{as a result of}} research-induced innovation or promotion. The potential annual returns and their distribution among the various industry sectors were estimated from different hypothetical investment scenarios to demonstrate the model’s relevance to R&D and promotion policy and decision-making.

5|$|The First Fleet {{brought the}} initial {{population}} of 70 sheep from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia in 1788. The next shipment was of 30 sheep from Calcutta and Ireland in 1793. All {{of the early}} sheep brought to Australia were exclusively used for the dietary needs of the penal colonies. The beginnings of the Australian <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> were due {{to the efforts of}} Captain John Macarthur. At Macarthur's urging 16 Spanish merinos were imported in 1797, effectively beginning the Australian sheep industry. By 1801 Macarthur had 1,000 head of sheep, and in 1803 he exported 111 kilograms (245lb) of wool to England. Today, Macarthur is generally thought of as the father of the Australian sheep industry.|$|E
25|$|PETA {{has also}} {{objected to the}} {{practice}} of mulesing (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep). In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian <b>wool</b> <b>industry,</b> leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores. In response, the Australian <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents flystrike, a very painful disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> agreed to seek alternatives to mulesing.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy was}} {{concentrated}} on <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> for centuries, however, since the 1960s, Tilburg has made more progress in having {{different kinds of}} industries, supported {{by the government to}} save the city from poverty after the decline of <b>wool</b> <b>industry.</b> Chemical company IFF has a factory in Tilburg. In the 1980s, the Japanese company Fujifilm came to Tilburg. Insurance companies like Interpolis and CZ are headquartered in Tilburg, as well. Iris Ohyama has its European offices in Tilburg.|$|E

40|$|The QPLU$ Merino {{breeding}} {{project began}} in the early 1990 s. The aim of the project was to demonstrate the efficiency of using a selection index to achieve breeding objectives. A number of selection lines were created from three strains of Merino sheep. During the ten-year course of the project, selection of each line was undertaken using an index based on measurements of fleece weight and fibre diameter. Different emphases were placed on each trait in each selected line.

25|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries Leeds {{and other}} <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> centred towns {{continued}} to grow, along with Huddersfield, Hull and Sheffield, while coal mining {{first came into}} prominence in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Canals and turnpike roads were introduced in the late 18th century. In the following century the spa towns of Harrogate and Scarborough flourished, due to people believing mineral water had curative properties.|$|E
50|$|The Ministerialists, many of {{whom were}} {{businessmen}} for whom their parliamentary career was not their primary concern, were primarily conservative in character.

25|$|The {{construction}} of water works and aspects of water technology in India {{is described in}} Arabic and Persian works. During medieval times, the diffusion of Indian and Persian irrigation technologies gave rise to an advanced irrigation system which bought about economic growth and also helped {{in the growth of}} material culture.

50|$|He {{was elected}} to the House of Representatives at the 1931 election, when he won Grey for the United Australia Party, {{defeating}} incumbent Labor MP Andrew Lacey. As a backbencher, he advocated for increased assistance to farmers and lower tariffs, and was concerned with the interests of the wheat and <b>wool</b> <b>industries,</b> being that he represented one of the largest electorates in Australia. He was easily re-elected in 1934.|$|R
25|$|The <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> {{took off}} in the 16th century, {{partly due to the}} river. The plague hit the town hard in 1611 and 1636. This, a {{recession}} in the woollen industry, and a drop in corn production in 1622 and 1623, caused massive hardship for the town's population. The trade in cloth faced further problems during the English Civil War due to a Royalist proclamation that prohibited the sale of cloth to the Parliamentarian-controlled London.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as the <b>wool</b> <b>industry</b> collapsed, Cees Becht was the mayor of Tilburg. While he was in office, many {{buildings}} were destroyed, including some very precious monuments. The neighbourhood Koningswei (King's Meadows) was demolished and replaced by Koningsplein (King's Square). The old neighbourhood was some kind of slum and had to be replaced by newer development. The newer development, however, wasn't as successful as was expected, and the square feels abandoned most of the year.|$|E
25|$|Corsham was {{historically}} a centre {{for agriculture}} and later, the <b>wool</b> <b>industry,</b> and remains {{a focus for}} quarrying Bath Stone. It contains several notable historic buildings, such as the stately home of Corsham Court. During the Second World War and the Cold War, it became a major administrative and manufacturing centre for the Ministry of Defence, with numerous establishments both above ground and in the old quarry tunnels. The early 21st century saw growth in Corsham's role in the film industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{inspiration}} for the name Rams derives from the pioneering past of Western Sydney; and as recognition of the settlers that started the Australian sheep and <b>wool</b> <b>industries</b> in Parramatta.

Orange and blue mirror the colours of the City of Parramatta.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{as the former}} {{thriving}} cider and <b>wool</b> <b>industries</b> declined, island farmers benefited from the development of two luxury products - Jersey cattle and Jersey Royal potatoes. The former {{was the product of}} careful and selective breeding programmes; the latter was a total fluke. The anarchist philosopher, Peter Kropotkin, who visited the Channel Islands in 1890, 1896, and 1903, described the agriculture of Jersey in The Conquest of Bread.|$|R
