500|$|Thompson {{continued}} with supporting {{roles in the}} 2003 drama Imagining Argentina, where she played a dissident-journalist abducted by the country's 1970s dictatorial regime. Antonio Banderas played the husband who tries to find her, in a film that most critics disliked. The film was booed and jeered at when it was screened at the Venice Film Festival and received a scathing article in The Guardian. Thompson had greater success that year when she worked with HBO {{for a second time}} in the acclaimed miniseries Angels in America (2003). The show, also featuring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> epidemic in Reagan-era America. Thompson played three roles– a nurse, a homeless woman, and the title role of The Angel of America– and was again nominated for an Emmy Award. In 2004, she played the eccentric [...] Divination teacher Sybill Trelawney in the third Harry Potter film, the Prisoner of Azkaban, her character described as a [...] "hippy chick professor who teaches fortune-telling". She later reprised her role in the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and the Deathly Hallows– Part 2 (2011), and has called her time on the popular franchise [...] "great fun".|$|E

It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

500|$|... "Steve Burdick" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. The Seattle Times described the episode as [...] "as honest {{an exploration of}} AIDS as anything seen on commercial network TV". Moffett's performance was singled out for praise, as was Richard Gollance's script, for [...] "look {{at a number of}} aspects of the AIDS problem, exploring a variety of attitudes about it". The Times marks this as the best episode of the series. The Hartford Courant concurred in this assessment, citing the episode as the most memorable of one of the season's most daring new series. Gollance's script was also praised by critic Jon Burlingame, writing for United Features Syndicate, for delivering accurate information on AIDS and HIV. Burlingame called the episode [...] "as much an indictment of commercial television for its skittishness in dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> crisis as it is a show about AIDS patients" [...] and speculated that this may have been the reason NBC initially pulled it. He cited this episode, along with two AIDS-themed episodes of NBC's Midnight Caller (themselves the subject of protests from gay and AIDS activists), as [...] "network series TV's finest AIDS-related dramas to date". Right-wing activists criticized dialogue from the episode in which Burdick overhears his hospital roommate in prayer and admonishes him that he didn't pay attention well enough in church to learn that God ignores the prayers of [...] "faggots".|$|E

2500|$|According to Bruce Mailman, a gay events organizer, [...] "public partying on Halloween {{fits into}} gay liberation in general, being seen and heard" [...] in a heteronormative society where media {{watchdog}} groups like GLAAD {{have had to}} campaign to ensure that LGBT people are portrayed and done so accurately without perpetuating negative stereotypes. In addition to visibility issues there is also escapism components as the LGBT community dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> pandemic and faced the generally negative domestic policy of the Reagan administration towards LGBT people and the AIDS crisis that was impacting the gay male communities.|$|E

2500|$|The Normal Heart is a play set between 1981 and 1984. It {{addresses}} a writer named Ned Weeks as he nurses his lover, who is dying of an unnamed disease. His doctors are puzzled and frustrated by having no resources to research it. Meanwhile, the unnamed organization Weeks {{is involved in}} is angered by the bad publicity Weeks' activism is generating, and eventually throws him out. Kramer later explained, [...] "I tried to make Ned Weeks as obnoxious as I could... I was trying, somehow and again, to atone for my own behavior." [...] The experience was overwhelmingly emotional for Kramer, as at one time during rehearsals he watched actor Brad Davis hold his dying lover played by D.W. Moffett on stage; Kramer {{went into the bathroom}} and sobbed, only moments later to find Davis holding him. The play is considered a literary landmark. It contended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> crisis when few would speak of the disease afflicting gay men, including gays themselves; it remains the longest-running play ever staged at the Public Theater, running for a year starting in 1985. It has been produced over 600 times in the U.S., Europe (where it was televised in Poland), Israel, and South Africa. Actors following Davis who portrayed Kramer's alter ego Ned Weeks included Joel Grey, Richard Dreyfuss (in Los Angeles), Martin Sheen (at the Royal Court in London), Tom Hulce and then John Shea in the West End, Raul Esparza in a highly acclaimed 2004 revival at the Public Theater, and most recently Joe Mantello on Broadway at the Golden Theater. Upon seeing the production of The Normal Heart, Naomi Wolf commented, [...] "No one else on the left at that time... ever used the moral framework that is {{so much a part of}} Kramer's voice, and that the right has coopted so skillfully. [...] Conscience, responsibility, calling; truth and lies, clarity of purpose or abandonment of one's moral calling; loyalty and betrayal..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Ugandan Bahá'í {{community}} {{has been involved in}} a wide range of projects many of which benefit the nation while also advancing awareness of the religion. In 1989 a Bahá'í expert and businessman in using appropriate technology from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Uganda training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries. In 1989 a Bahá'í Club was organized for Makerere University composed of Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís while the national assembly invited members of the Department of Religious Studies at Makerere University to the Bahá'í House of Worship to familiarize staff with the religion, its institutions and how they function to contextualize the interaction between the agencies of the religion and the university while it implemented two new courses designed and taught by a Bahá'í, Dr. Tim Rost, on [...] "Peace and Justice" [...] and another on [...] "Religion and Development." [...] At the same time Bahá'í women of Mbale took part in events organized by the National Council on Women by a multicultural children's program emphasizing good neighborliness and handicrafts of women - government administrators observed that Bahá'ís had several programs advancing diverse issues in Uganda. In 1990 the Bahá'í Office of Social and Economic Development in Uganda established a project to train healthcare field workers for work in Uganda. In 1993 the national assembly added a project to develop a middle-level management training program for community level primary health care workers. The focus was on prevention of childhood diseases, maternal-infant health care, and community building. Later, the Uganda Bahá'í Institute for Development set up a project introducing use of the latrine, immunization, and nets to fight off malaria-bearing mosquitoes, and people learned the importance of clean water in a Ugandan village. In 2000, the Bahá'ís of Uganda shared their activities in the areas of education, family health, moral training for children, publishing, and collaboration with other non-governmental organizations at a national United Nations Day celebration held at the Muguluka Primary School near Jinja. After receiving her Ph.D. at age 78, Zylpha Mapp-Robinson returned to Uganda at age 86 in the year 2000 to create the Ugandan Institution for the advancement of Women. In 2002 a National Conference in Guyana on [...] "Spiritual Approach to the Challenge of HIV/AIDS" [...] sponsored by the Varqa Foundation, UNICEF, & Bahá'í International Community highlighted experiences in Uganda dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> epidemic by including the role of the spiritual training of children on virtues like humility, reverence, kindliness, respect and courtesy, and unity in diversity so that they would lead moral lives and overcome not only AIDS but alcohol and drug abuse, violence, crime, prejudice, hatred, intolerance and poverty. In 2004 the Bahá'í-based Uganda Program of Literacy for Transformation helped participants acquire the skills, knowledge, and incentive for a “lifelong self-improvement plan” — coupled with an emphasis on moral education and inter-religious harmony.|$|E
