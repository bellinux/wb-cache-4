This paper summarizes and enumerates some comprehensive utilization methods and proposes new ideas on the disposal and comprehensive utilization of solid <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> mines, including reducing the discharge of solid waste by recovering sand from ore dressing flow for construction industry and a mine back filling approaches. The process flow of tailings separated for different purposes that could be carried out in iron mines is putting forward.

The emissions {{associated with the}} combustion of support fuels during the cremation process are also included (Figure 1). 2 CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL EMISSIONS The contribution of this activity to national emissions is comparatively small for all pollutants except for Heavy Metals (HM), especially mercury, in certain countries (Tables 2. 1 - 2. 2). Hydrogen chloride (HCl) emissions can be significant, although the emissions of HCl <b>from</b> individual <b>crematorium</b> can vary considerably. There is currently limited information on the emissions of POPs <b>from</b> <b>crematoria.</b> The OSPARCOM-HELCOM-UNECE Emission Inventory indicates that crematoria contribute 0. 2 % of the total emissions of dioxins and furans. Crematoria also {{have the potential to}} emit PAHs, but are unlikely to release significant emissions of other POPs or sulphurhexafluoride (SF 6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) or perfluorocarbons (PFCs), (ETC/AEM-CITEPA-RISOE 1997).
