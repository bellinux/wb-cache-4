25|$|Recent {{experimental}} recreations {{have proven}} {{that it is}} fully possible that the moai were literally <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> their quarries to their final positions by ingenious use of ropes.

If correct, it can be inferred that the fallen road moai {{were the result of}} the teams of balancers being unable to keep the statue upright, and it was presumably not possible to lift the statues again once knocked over. However, the debate continues.|$|E
