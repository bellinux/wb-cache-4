Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Chamberlin became Assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of War Department General Staff. At this time, the United States was {{embarking on}} a {{military}} buildup {{in response to a}} worsening international situation, which culminated in the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939. A major component of this build up <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses. Some $175 million was allocated to construction under the Expansion Program, as it became known.|$|E
5|$|Nashville {{reached the}} postseason during six of their seven {{seasons in the}} Southern League. They won three Western Division titles and two Southern League Championships. The Sounds' 13years with the American Association at the Triple-A level <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> contrast. The Sounds only managed three trips to the postseason, {{including}} two by virtue of winning the Eastern Division title. Though they did not perform well during their first few years with the Pacific Coast League, the team {{went on to win}} four division titles, two American Conference titles, and one Pacific Coast League Championship between 2003 and 2007. The Sounds did not qualify again for postseason play until 2016 when they won the American Conference Southern Division title.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E

During this time several families lived together because the caves or shelters under bluffs were larger. These shelters were always near to a clear spring of bubbling water.|$|E

From Sun Tzu, they learned the tactical side of military strategy and specific tactical prescriptions. From von Clausewitz, they learned the dynamic and unpredictable nature of military action. From Mao, they learned the principles of guerrilla warfare. Important marketing warfare books include Business War Games by Barrie James, Marketing Warfare by Al Ries and Jack Trout and Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun by Wess Roberts.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> building containing naval magazines and offices of different departments of the naval service. Renamed the Arsenal Real da Marinha (Royal Navy Shipyard), the official maritime works of the Ribeira das Naus continued operating there as in the expansive days of Manuel I, who had ordered the construction of new shipyards (tercenas) on the site of the medieval shipyards.|$|E

Reutemann took the first three victories of his F1 career at South Africa, Austria and the United States. He might have won the first race {{of the year in}} Argentina, too, but the Brabham team apparently failed to properly fuel his car and he ran out of fuel with less than two laps to go while safely in the lead. Though he matched Drivers' Champion Emerson Fittipaldi's win total, inconsistent performances in the other races left Reutemann sixth in the season standings.|$|E
25|$|Persia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> empire with {{a history}} that was already ancient {{before the arrival of}} Islam. Al-Mas‘udi was aware of the {{influence}} of ancient Babylon on Persia. He had access to a wealth of translations by scholars such as ibn al-Muqaffa from Middle Persian into Arabic. In his travels he also personally consulted Persian scholars and Zoroastrian priests. He thus had access to much material, factual and mythical. Like all other Arabic historians he was unclear on the Achaemenid dynasty, though he knew of Kurush (Cyrus the Great). He was much clearer on the more recent dynasties and his estimation of the time between Alexander the Great and Ardashir is much more accurately depicted than it is in al-Tabari.|$|E
