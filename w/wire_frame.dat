5|$|QuestWorld {{characters}} were created as <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked. Animation company Buzz F/X, based in Montreal and Santa Monica, created first season sequences. Work began in April 1996 {{with the opening}} titles—a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls. Buzz F/X used mostly inexperienced animators, as budgetary constraints would not permit hiring seasoned employees.|$|E
5|$|Magic in Vagrant Story {{is learned}} {{later in the}} game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire {{will remain in the}} menu, and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode <b>wire</b> <b>frame.</b> Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the new century, fashionable bodices had high necklines or {{extremely}} low, rounded necklines, and short wings at the shoulders. Separate closed cartwheel ruffs were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> or supportasse used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.|$|E
25|$|The game {{began with}} a 14 minute long high quality CGI {{animation}} to introduce the game's setting and even some gameplay features through the story of Jefferson Clay and his last battle. Along the campaign, shorter pieces of CGI encoded in RAD Game Tools's Smacker video format would be shown within missions as cutscenes. These sometimes provided clues to solving some problematic aspect of the current mission. Simple CGI animations utilising <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> models were used in mission briefings.|$|E
50|$|Extremely thick lenses for myopia can be beveled {{to reduce}} flaring {{out of the}} very thick edge. Thick myopic lenses are not usually mounted in <b>wire</b> <b>frames,</b> because the thin wire {{contrasts}} against the thick lens, to make its thickness much more obvious to others.|$|R

25|$|As well as {{the popular}} platypus mascot Expo Oz, {{designed}} by Disney's Imagineering Division, there were several themed initiatives that promoted World Expo 88, most notably the Expo's two interchangeable brands (as noted above): one an boomerang-styled '88' on a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> globe, and the colourful sunsails logo, which superimposed aspects of the Expo's entertainment on a relief {{of one of the}} Expo's popular sun sails (designed by Ken Cato, of Cato Purnell Partners). There was also a new weekly theme which allowed special-interest groups to entertain.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> {{may be used}} {{either with}} {{positional}} notation like other abaci (thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to 9,999,999,999), or each bead may represent one unit (so that e.g. 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire, so numbers up to 100 may be represented). In the bead frame shown, {{the gap between the}} 5th and 6th wire, corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire, suggests the latter use.|$|E
25|$|Minimal {{surfaces}} have {{a simple}} interpretation in real life: they are the shape a soap film will assume if a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> shaped like the curve is dipped into a soap solution and then carefully lifted out. The {{question as to whether}} a minimal surface with given boundary exists is called Plateau's problem after the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau who carried out experiments on soap films in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1930 Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó gave an affirmative answer to Plateau's problem (Douglas was awarded one of the first Fields medals for this work in 1936).|$|E

25|$|The trapper who has {{located a}} cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use zhao, a soft {{catching}} net on a <b>wire</b> <b>frame,</b> {{to contain the}} cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day. Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of bamboo or ivory rods. Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl {{with a hole in}} its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket was forced to leave its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.|$|E
500|$|The player {{advances}} {{the plot}} by acquiring log discs and e-mails: the game contains no non-player characters {{with which to}} converse. Throughout the game, an evil artificial intelligence called SHODAN hinders the player's progress with traps and blocked pathways. Specific computer terminals allow the player to temporarily enter Cyberspace; inside, the player moves weightlessly through a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> 3D environment, while collecting data and fighting SHODAN's security programs. Actions in Cyberspace sometimes cause events in the game's physical world; for example, certain locked doors may only be opened in Cyberspace. Outside of Cyberspace, the player uses the game's sixteen weapons, of which a maximum of seven may be carried at one time, to combat robots, cyborgs and mutants controlled by SHODAN. Projectile weapons often have selectable ammunition types with varying effects; for example, the [...] "dart pistol" [...] may fire either explosive needles or tranquilizers. Energy weapons and several types of explosives may also be found, with the latter ranging from percussion grenades to land mines.|$|E
500|$|Universal {{makeup artist}} Jack Pierce paid special {{attention}} to the Monster's appearance in this film. He altered his 1931 design to display the after-effects of the mill fire, adding scars and shortening the Monster's hair. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed. Pierce co-created the Bride's makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride's iconic hair style, based on Nefertiti. Lanchester's hair was given a Marcel wave over a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> to achieve the style. Lanchester disliked working with Pierce, who she said [...] "really did feel that he made these people, like he was a god... in the morning he'd be dressed in white as if he were in hospital to perform an operation." [...] To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make.|$|E

50|$|The {{structures}} that soap films make {{can not just}} be enclosed as spheres, but virtually any shape, for example in <b>wire</b> <b>frames.</b> Therefore, many different minimal surfaces can be designed. It is actually sometimes easier to physically make them than to compute them by mathematical modelling. This is why the soap films {{can be considered as}} analog computers which can outperform conventional computers, depending on the complexity of the system.|$|R

In the opening sequence, {{one of the}} graphics turns into a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> of a beating electronic heart, which [...] "pulls out" [...] with each beat. As the camera zooms, the heart grows in size and [...] "weaves" [...] to become Duff. According to MTV News, while she doesn't [...] "take on" [...] Pussy Galore, Plenty O'Toole, Holly Goodhead, or any other Bond girl, she becomes a [...] "Bond girl in spirit", switching from era to era with different looks, with her hair blowing and flying around in graphic silhouettes. Instead of cutting from image to image, the shots evolve in a Bond-like style [...] "as shapes take on different forms to reveal something else". Duff performs in silhouette, with a microphone, [...] "where a gun would otherwise be". In another shot, her band is a silhouette.

2500|$|The Roman ramp in {{the saddle}} below the Yodefat wall towers was a twin ramp and where it became steep, ramp infill was {{held in place by}} still visible {{concrete}} revetment. In 1993 a University of Rochester archaeological team [...] mapped a square kilometer centered on a brass datum placed near the center of Yodefat hill by British surveyors. The mapping project's primary goal was to create a digital elevation model with rendered <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> model and a map depicting all extant city archaeological features, the siege ramp, entrances to cisterns, an olive press on the lower eastern slope, and niche graves on the slopes below the walls. In addition, potential locations for Roman artillery were identified through analysis of ballista trajectories found archaeologically {{at the base of the}} north towers.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the captain}} of Dreadnaught, the player could assume the command {{of any of the}} four {{workstations}} on the command bridge. From the command station (CMD), the player received his/her mission briefings and could sometimes control other ships through a remote link. The station also had access to an accurate star map. The ship was normally flown from the navigation station (NAV). From the weapons station (WEP), the player had an outside view of Dreadnaught's <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> model. Following a locked target, the angle of view could rotate 360 degrees on all [...] This workstation also had a ripple fire mode which allowed attacking quickly a large group of enemies. The fourth station engineering (ENG) was for controlling the repairs when the ship was damaged by weapons or a collision with another object. However, the automated repair functioned well and player supervision was rarely needed. The station also had a fuel gauge, which was nonfunctional because the game design was changed to give Dreadnaught limitless fuel.|$|E
2500|$|Projecting images onto a shape was an {{idea that}} both {{directors}} decided on together in a meeting. Shiga had only four days to create the projections before the video shoot, so contracted the work to an artist he previous collaborated with called Masaya Yoshida, {{as well as an}} art creation company. The projections of the members' faces were taken from video chats with the band members before the video recording. The dodecahedron was an idea of Kitazawa's, as he considered {{it one of the most}} beautiful shapes, and felt that a beautiful shape would work well as a [...] metaphor for the human brain. The shape is made of scrim attached to a <b>wire</b> <b>frame,</b> in order for both the members and the projections to be seen. Two projectors were used to display the images onto the dodecahedron. No trial run was done before the video's shooting, and instead Shiga modelled the set-up as a computer-aided design until he was satisfied with the arrangement.|$|E
