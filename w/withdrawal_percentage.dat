40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the initial stages}} of a new evaluation framework for choosing among retirement income strategies. The investigation includes eight retirement income strategies: constant inflation-adjusted withdrawal amounts, a constant <b>withdrawal</b> <b>percentage</b> of remaining assets, a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>percentage</b> based on remaining life expectancy, a more aggressive hybrid <b>withdrawal</b> <b>percentage,</b> inflation-adjusted and fixed single premium immediate annuities, a variable annuity with a guaranteed living withdrawal benefit rider, and a strategy which annuitizes the flooring level to meet basic needs and uses the hybrid <b>withdrawal</b> <b>percentage</b> for remaining assets. These eight strategies will be analyzed with six retirement outcome measures over a 30 -year retirement period: the average amount whereby spending falls below the minimally acceptable level, the average spending amount, the remaining bequest {{at the end of the}} retirement period, the minimum spending amount for any year in the retirement period, a measure of whether spending increases or decreases over time defined as spending in the first year divided by spending in the 30 th year, and the value of total spending after accounting for diminishing returns from increased spending for a client with somewhat inflexible spending needs. The model is applied to three client scenarios representing a cross-section of RIIA’s client segmentation matrix. It is built using Monte Carlo simulations which reflect current market conditions, so that systematic withdrawals and guaranteed products share compatible underlying assumptions. ...|$|E
40|$|Just over 22 {{percent of}} {{individuals}} who owned a Traditional or Roth individual retirement account (IRA) took a withdrawal in 2013. The overall IRA <b>withdrawal</b> <b>percentage</b> was largely driven by activity among individuals ages 70 - or older owning a Traditional IRA—the group required to make withdrawals under federal required minimum distribution (RMD) rules for IRA owners beyond that age. In contrast, among individuals under age 60, 10 percent or fewer had a withdrawal. For those at the RMD age, the withdrawal rates at the median appeared close to the amount that was required to be withdrawn, though some were significantly more. For instance, looking at the consistent sample in the EBRI IRA Database, approximately 25 percent of those 71 or older took a withdrawal amount in excess of that required by law for Traditional IRAs. Among those ages 70 or older, withdrawal rates over a four-year period showed that most individuals were withdrawing {{at a rate that}} was {{likely to be able to}} sustain some level of post-retirement income from IRAs as the individual continued to age...|$|E
50|$|Strayer has {{higher rates}} of student {{retention}} than other for-profit schools. Among students first enrolled in 2008-09, by mid-2010 slightly less than one-third had withdrawn without completing their degree programs. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>percentages</b> ranged from 17.9 percent for master's degree students to 48.8 percent for students seeking an associate degree. In 2011 the Washington Post claimed that Strayer had a 15 percent graduation rate, while Strayer claimed the graduation rate for its full cohort of bachelor's students was 33 percent.|$|R
40|$|Objective: TNF inhibitors (TNFi) have revolutionised the {{treatment}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Natural killer (NK) cells and Natural Killer Cell Receptor + T (NKT) cells comprise important effector lymphocytes whose activity is tightly regulated through surface NK receptors (NKRs). Dysregulation of NKRs in patients with autoimmune diseases has been shown, however little is known regarding NKRs expression in patients with TNFi-induced remission and in those who maintain remission vs disease flare following TNFi withdrawal. Methods: Patients with RA were recruited for this study, (i) RA patients in clinical remission following a minimum of one year of TNFi therapy (n = 215); (2) Active RA patients, not currently or ever receiving TNFi (n = 18); and healthy control volunteers (n = 15). Patients in remission {{were divided into two}} groups: those who were maintained on TNFi and those who withdrew from TNFi and maintained on DMARDS. All patients underwent full clinical assessment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and NKR (CD 94, NKG 2 A, CD 161, CD 69, CD 57, CD 158 a, CD 158 b) expression on T-(CD 3 + CD 56 2), NK-(CD 3 2 CD 56 +) and NKT-(CD 3 + CD 56 +) cells was determined by flow cytometry. Results: Following TNFi <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>percentages</b> and numbers of circulating T cells, NK cells or NKT cell populations were unchanged in patients in remission versus active RA or HCs. Expression of the NKRs CD 161, CD 57, CD 94 and NKG 2 A was significantly increased on CD 3 + CD 56 -T cells from patients in remission compared to active RA (p, 0. 05). CD 3 + CD 56 -T cel...|$|R

40|$|A four-week {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of partially or completely withdrawing fish meal from broiler finisher diets on growth performance and carcass yield. In a completely randomized design, ninety six (96) four-week-old Marshall Breed of broilers were allotted to four dietary treatments having 0, 50, 75 and 100 % of their fishmeal content withdrawn. Each dietary treatment had 24 birds with 3 replicates of 8 birds. Results show that initial weights, final weights, average daily feed intake, average daily weight gain, feed conversion ratio and feed cost per kilogram gain were not negatively affected (P> 0. 05) by levels of fish meal <b>withdrawal.</b> Dressing <b>percentages</b> were also not significantly different (P> 0. 05) between treatment means. However, the percent carcass cut-up parts of breast, wings, thighs and drumsticks to live weight of birds fed diets with fish meal totally withdrawn were significantly less (P< 0. 05) than those of birds fed diets containing fish meal. From this study, it can be concluded that withdrawing fish meal from broiler finisher diets may not have any adverse effect on their growth performance provided protein is obtained from non-animal sources. However, total withdrawal of fish meal negatively affects optimum development of the cut-up parts and as such 0. 5 - 1 % fish meal may be included in broiler finisher diets for full development of carcass components...|$|R
40|$|Antispasmodics {{may improve}} mucosal {{visualization}} during colonoscope withdrawal, potentially improving polyp and adenoma detection. Meta-analysis and case-control studies suggest a 9  % to 13  % relative increase in adenoma and polyp detection. We aimed {{to assess the}} impact of hyoscine butylbromide on the expected visualization during colonoscope withdrawal using a CT colonography (CTC) simulation. Datasets from a previous CTC study examining the effect of antispasmodic were re-analyzed with customised CTC software, adjusted to simulate a standard colonoscopic view. Eighty-six patients received intravenous (IV) hyoscine butylbromide 20  mg, 40  mg or no antispasmodic. Main outcome measurements at unidirectional flythrough, simulating colonoscope <b>withdrawal,</b> were <b>percentage</b> colonic surface visualization, numbers and sizes of unseen areas, and colonic length. Use of antispasmodic was associated with a significant relative increase in percentage surface visualization of 2. 6  % to 3. 9  %, compared with no antispasmodic, P <  0. 006. Total numbers of missed areas and intermediate sized (300  -  1000  mm(2)) missed areas were significantly decreased, by approximately 20  %. There were no differences between the 20 -mg and 40 -mg doses. Mean colonic length (161  -  169  cm) was unchanged by antispasmodic. IV hyoscine butylbromide at simulated colonoscope withdrawal was associated with significant increases in surface visualization, which might explain up to half the improvement in adenoma detection seen in clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|We placed {{recycling}} receptacles in {{two locations}} in academic buildings and studied re-cycling behavior within an ABA multiple baseline design. During baseline, recycling receptacles {{were placed in}} a central location. During the intervention, receptacles were moved into classrooms where beverages were primarily consumed. Baseline conditions were then reinstated. The percentage of cans recycled daily increased during intervention and returned to near-baseline levels during <b>withdrawal.</b> The <b>percentage</b> of cans discarded daily in the trash decreased during the intervention and increased to near-baseline levels during withdrawal. Implications of this study include making recycling more convenient in institutional settings. DESCRIPTORS: aluminum can recycling, stimulus control, response covariation Behavioral research has identified numer-ous interventions that increase recycling be-haviors. Austin, Hatfield, Grindle, and Bai-ley (1993) used signs and education to in-crease paper recycling in two college depart-ments. By placing signs over the trash containers and recycling containers, they in-creased recyclables from 5 1 % in baseline to 84 % in the experimental condition. WII-liams (199 1) reported that {{less than half of}} the students in residence halls recycled their daily newspapers. He suggested that a ma-jority of students would recycle if drop-off facilities were convenient for them. Brothers, Krantz, and McClannahan (1994) found that when recycling containers were placed in a central location of an office building, 28 % of recyclable paper was recycled. When the containers were moved closer to the workers, recycling increased to 88 % of all pap r, and similar results were maintained for up to 7 months afterward. The present study provided a systematic repl cation of the study by Brothers et al. (1994) appliedto student recycling behav-iors in university academic buildings. By mak g recycling more convenient, it was predicted that patrons of two academic buildings would increase their aluminum can recycling...|$|R
40|$|This paper employs an {{experimental}} model {{to provide additional}} insight into the effect explicit deposit insurance has on depositor behavior {{in the time of}} a bank crisis. The strength of the conjoint approach used in this study is that it combines the control of a laboratory experiment with the external validity of a field-based survey. Respondent samples are selected from banking markets with and without an established system of deposit insurance. Given an extensive amount of literature in this field, our core hypothesis is that the respondents from the latter market will exhibit more significant monitoring behavior even after allowing for insurance features. We use an empirical model with both demanded interest cost and <b>percentage</b> <b>withdrawal</b> rate as correlated dependent variables. The results first indicate that depositors in this study did not place importance on the varying deposit insurance components in their response to the banking crisis. The primary influence on their behavior is the magnitude of deposits at risk as defined by both the level of the insured limit {{and the size of the}} deposit relative to that limit. While the role of bank fundamentals, as measured by the level of buffer capital, was generally significant, there was no significant difference among the samples. These results raise questions about how explicit deposit insurance does affect the monitoring intensity of depositors given a credible implicit insurance system. Important differences in the subsamples also provide added insight into the motivations associated with variations in depositor monitoring. ...|$|R
30|$|From 1977 to 1982, {{value of}} {{pressurized}} irrigation has been increased therefore; a minor decreasing is observable for area waterlogged. However, value of area salinized has been increased due to increase of agricultural water withdrawal and consequently {{a part of}} it that is used for irrigation. From 1982 to 1987, localized irrigation has been increased (Pollok et al. 1990) hence; value of area waterlogged has been diminished. Also, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased due to increase of agricultural water withdrawal again. From 1987 to 1992, pressurized irrigation and agricultural water withdrawal have been increased. Hence, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased and area waterlogged has been decreased. From 1992 to 1997, values of surface irrigation (in comparison with pressurized irrigation), area waterlogged, agricultural water <b>withdrawal,</b> and <b>percentage</b> of area equipped for irrigation salinized, have been increased due to lack of appropriate management in the previous years and high costs as well as the dilemmas of these systems (Biswas 1986; Famoriyo 1984; Alam 1991). Note that NRI has been decreased from 1992 to 1997 and this indicates highlighted role of increase of surface irrigation (Houk et al. 2006). From 1997 to 2002, problems occurred in the previous period raised tendency to use of pressurized irrigation systems afresh but with a reasonable approach and competent management (Qadir and Oster 2004). This approach led to increase of pressurized irrigation as well as decrease of area waterlogged by irrigation. From 2002 to 2007, pressurized irrigation was still growing (Kigalu et al. 2008; Karlberg et al. 2007; Kheira 2009 b) and values of area waterlogged by irrigation and percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized were decreased due to suitable management and decrease of agricultural water withdrawal. From 2007 to 2011, we could see a fall in agricultural water withdrawal (however, this index is allowable to increase if a suitable use), percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized, and area waterlogged and a growth in spate irrigation that needs to specific attention to deal with sedimentation (Embaye et al. 2012). The good event is raise of localized irrigation and its considerable impact on water conservation (Ward and Pulido-Velazquez 2008). However, value of conservation agriculture area is not desirable yet. In the final step, cropping intensity (area equipped) has been studied for Africa in the previous half of century.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Long-term use of opioids has acute {{effects on}} {{homeostasis}} of the body. Discovering {{the impacts of}} opioids on hematological parameters of narcotics withdrawal and dependents blood may be helpful in recognizing the homeostasis condition of their body for the useful treatment. In this study a cross-sectional method was applied. The abusers of opium and heroin {{for more than two}} consecutive years were considered as opium and heroin dependent groups, respectively. The dependent people, who passed the 1 -month withdrawal period, entered the study as opium and heroin withdrawal groups. In this study, hematological factors of heroin and opium dependent and withdrawal groups were investigated. The RBC count remained unchanged in all groups. The WBC count had a significant increase in opium dependent group but in heroin dependent group and withdrawal group there was no significant difference. HGB level had a significant increase only in opium and heroin <b>withdrawal</b> groups. The <b>percentage</b> of HCT had a significant increase in all groups. The MCV increased in heroin and opium dependent groups. MCH level increased significantly in heroin and opium withdrawal groups. MCHC level had a significant increase in all groups. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in heroin and opium addicted groups significantly decreased. Platelet, neutrophil and monocyte counts significantly increased in opium dependent group. Monocyte countshowed a significant reduction in heroin withdrawal group. Eosinophil count showed no difference in any of the groups. The current study indicated that not only the chronic and long-term use of opium and heroin, also withdrawal of addicted people could change hematological parameters related to human serum...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypocretin (orexin) {{signaling}} {{is involved}} in drug addiction. In this study, we investigated the role of these hypothalamic neuropeptides in nicotine withdrawal by using behavioral and neuroanatomical approaches. METHODS: Nicotine withdrawal syndrome was precipitated by mecamylamine (2 mg/kg, subcutaneous) in C 57 BL/ 6 J nicotine-dependent mice (25 mg/kg/day for 14 days) pretreated with the hypocretin receptor 1 (Hcrtr- 1) antagonist SB 334867 (5 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), the hypocretin receptor 2 antagonist TCSOX 229 (5 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and in preprohypocretin knockout mice. c-Fos expression was analyzed in several brain areas related to nicotine dependence by immunofluorescence techniques. Retrograde tracing with rhodamine-labeled fluorescent latex microspheres {{was used to determine}} whether the hypocretin neurons project directly to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and SB 334867 was locally administered intra-PVN (10 nmol/side) to test the specific involvement of Hcrtr- 1 in this brain area during nicotine withdrawal. /nRESULTS: Somatic signs of nicotine withdrawal were attenuated in mice pretreated with SB 334867 and in preprohypocretin knockout mice. No changes were found in TCSOX 229 pretreated animals. Nicotine <b>withdrawal</b> increased the <b>percentage</b> of hypocretin cells expressing c-Fos in the perifornical, dorsomedial, and lateral hypothalamus. In addition, the increased c-Fos expression in the PVN during withdrawal was dependent on hypocretin transmission through Hcrtr- 1 activation. Hypocretin neurons directly innervate the PVN and the local infusion of SB 334867 into the PVN decreased the expression of nicotine withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that hypocretin signaling acting on Hcrtr- 1 in the PVN plays {{a crucial role in the}} expression of nicotine withdrawal.
