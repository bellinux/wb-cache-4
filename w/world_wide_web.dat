As a testbed browser, Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww.

5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in {{software for the}} <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web,</b> the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as a synonym for a URI that uses the scheme http or https.

5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically the <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web,</b> using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI.

More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E
5|$|While at Digital, Kotok {{recognized}} the Web's potential, {{and helped to}} found the <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web</b> Consortium. Early in 1994, in Zürich, Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee had met with Michael Dertouzos to discuss starting a new organization at MIT. In April 1994, Kotok, Steve Fink, Gail Grant and Brian Reid from Digital traveled to CERN in Geneva to speak with Berners-Lee {{about the need for}} a consortium to create open standards and coordinate Web development.

5|$|The {{rise of the}} {{internet}} has resulted in many broadcasters ceasing their shortwave transmissions in favor of broadcasting over the <b>world</b> <b>wide</b> <b>web.</b> When BBC World Service discontinued service to Europe, North America, Australasia, and the Caribbean, it generated many protests and activist {{groups such as the}} Coalition to Save the BBC World Service. In the US, the shifting of resources from shortwave to Internet and television by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. international broadcasting, has also resulted in reduced broadcasting hours in the English language. Radio Netherlands, Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moscow), Radio Canada International and Radio Australia are among the prominent broadcasters who have ceased broadcasting on shortwave. Although most of the prominent broadcasters continue to scale back their analog shortwave transmissions or completely terminate them, shortwave is still very common and active in developing regions such as parts of Africa.|$|E
