5|$|The {{story is}} set in 1967. Bond is {{instructed}} by his superior, M, to investigate a man named Dr Julius Gorner, and his bodyguard, Chagrin. Bond is warned that his performance will be monitored and that a new 00 agent is <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> if his actions go awry.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Felix Leiter and Darius inform agent Silver of {{the second}} method of attack. Silver shows {{himself to be a}} double agent by failing to call in an airstrike against the Ekranoplan and by {{attempting}} to kill Leiter and Darius. In the shoot-out Darius successfully calls in the airstrike at the cost of his own life and Leiter survives only thanks to the timely arrival of Hamid, his taxi driver. The Ekranoplan is destroyed by RAF Vulcan bombers before it reaches its target. Bond and Scarlett escape through Russia but are pursued by Chagrin, whom Bond finally kills on a train. Later Gorner meets him on a boat and tries to shoot him, but Bond pushes him overboard, where he is torn to pieces by a propeller. With the subsequent elimination of both Chagrin and Gorner, Bond considers his mission a success, and on condition that the agent M has <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> will not take his place Bond is sent to assess the new agent, designated 004. She turns out to be Scarlett Papava. Scarlett discloses that the story of her twin sister was a ploy to convince Bond to enable her to join the mission. Papava feared that if Bond knew she was a potential 00 agent, he would not have worked with her. With Bond returning to active duty, Scarlett moves off to her own operations as a full 00 agent.|$|E

25|$|Behind the curtain, {{the actors}} were taking their {{positions}} {{in a box}} set representing an old boathouse {{on the bank of}} the Seine. This was constructed of painted canvas on a flimsy wooden frame and mainly blocked the backstage and flies from view. Kate Claxton, playing Louise, the blind orphan girl, along with actors J. B. Studley and H. S. Murdoch, had taken their places on stage within the box set and were waiting for the curtain to rise. Claxton was lying on a pallet of straw, looking up.

25|$|The rise of state-subsidised theatre, and the {{emergence}} of kitchen sink drama undermined Beaumont's pre-eminence beginning in the 1950s. He disapproved of both, and stuck to his style of lavish, starry West End productions, even when they began to go out of fashion. He alienated both Coward and Terence Rattigan with his arrogant and sometimes duplicitous behaviour. Beaumont attempted to sabotage the former's new play <b>Waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> by telling him that the actresses Coward wanted to cast refused to play in it, whereas in reality Beaumont had not consulted them. He continued to have enormous successes: in 1958, he presented the first British productions of both West Side Story (1040 performances) and My Fair Lady (2281 performances). The latter cost an unprecedented sum to stage, but, thanks to a sustained publicity campaign by Tennent's, advance bookings meant that the show was in net profit two months before it opened.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire at {{this time}} was {{in a period of}} transition. They had won the {{championship}} four times between 1922 and 1925 but had since then been overshadowed by their great rivals Lancashire who had won the title in each of the preceding three seasons. In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established professionals like Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year. <b>Waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> however, was Hedley Verity who was then playing in the Lancashire League and made his Yorkshire debut in 1930.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire's strong {{challenge}} for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.|$|E
500|$|A {{symposium}} {{published in}} 1999 {{to mark the}} centenary of Coward's birth listed some of his major productions scheduled for the year in Britain and North America, including Ace of Clubs, After the Ball, Blithe Spirit, Cavalcade, Easy Virtue, Hay Fever, Present Laughter, Private Lives, Sail Away, A Song at Twilight, The Young Idea and <b>Waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wings,</b> with stars including Lauren Bacall, Rosemary Harris, Ian McKellen, Corin Redgrave, Vanessa Redgrave and Elaine Stritch. In another tribute, Tim Rice said of Coward's songs: [...] "The wit and wisdom of Noël Coward's lyrics will be as lively and contemporary in 100 years' time as they are today", and many have been recorded by Damon Albarn, Ian Bostridge, The Divine Comedy, Elton John, Valerie Masterson, Paul McCartney, Michael Nyman, Pet Shop Boys, Vic Reeves, Sting, Joan Sutherland, Robbie Williams and others.|$|E
500|$|During the 1950s and 1960s Coward {{continued}} to write musicals and plays. After the Ball, his 1953 adaptation of Lady Windermere's Fan, {{was the last}} musical he premiered in the West End; his last two musicals were first produced on Broadway. Sail Away (1961), set on a luxury cruise liner, was Coward's most successful post-war musical, with productions in America, Britain and Australia. The Girl Who Came to Supper, a musical adaptation of The Sleeping Prince (1963), ran for only three months. He directed the successful 1964 Broadway musical adaptation of Blithe Spirit, called High Spirits. Coward's late plays include a farce, Look After Lulu! (1959), and a tragi-comic study of old age, <b>Waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> (1960), {{both of which were}} successful despite [...] "critical disdain". Coward argued that the primary purpose of a play was to entertain, and he made no attempt at modernism, which he felt was boring to the audience although fascinating to the critics. His comic novel, Pomp and Circumstance (1960), about life in a tropical British colony, met with more critical success.|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{the period}} during which it was constructed, {{and because it was}} not {{designed}} to be a performance venue, the Ryman lacked a true backstage area. There was only one dressing room for the men, while women were relegated to an inadequate ladies restroom. The shortage of space forced performers to <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> <b>the</b> narrow hallways, and the alley behind the buildings south wall. Thus, many performers often ventured across the alley to Tootsies Orchid Lounge and other bars, where they would drink alongside - and sometimes perform for - patrons. This practice enhanced the notoriety of the honky-tonk bars along Nashvilles Lower Broadway.Prior to September 27, 1963, Ryman Auditorium had no singular owner, instead being an independent entity governed by a board of directors.

500|$|Footage {{from the}} season was shown at New York Comic Con in October 2015, and at Comic Con Experience that December. On February 15, 2016, {{the first part of}} the season trailer was {{released}} focusing on the Punisher, while the second part focusing on Elektra was released 10 days later, on February 25. Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt the first part is [...] "clearly going for a vibe similar to that first full-length Dark Knight teaser back in December of 2007, with Castle being framed as a natural byproduct of/reaction to Daredevil’s own vigilantism". He also appreciated that it appeared Castle would be presented as a villain, as the previous film adaptions of the character always had Castle [...] "still a hero at the end." [...] Mendelson's one drawback to the trailer was when Castle starts [...] "monologue-ing" [...] in the last third, feeling Bernthal [...] "casts such an imposing and grim shadow as a near-silent angel of death that the [...] mood is almost broken". Joanna Robinson at Vanity Fair felt that the premise of the trailer, with Daredevil facing the Punisher, is [...] "right in line with the big superhero trend this spring", comparing it to [...] and , which feature Captain America fighting Iron Man and Batman fighting Superman, respectively.
