40|$|After the Great East Tohoku Earthquake of 2011, {{operations}} at three critical reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi site were disrupted. All three reactor plants had automatic shutdowns. After a reactor is shutdown from power, decay heat {{must continue to}} be removed for several hours. The earthquake caused electrical equipment disruption which interrupted power supply from off-site. In Unit 2, emergency diesel generators and battery power were also affected. This interruption of on-site and off-site power affected operability of decay heat removal systems. In Unit 2, the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling System (RCIC) was an installed means of removing decay heat. The RCIC System uses a tangential flow impulse turbine called a Terry turbine to power a pump, which directs cooling water into the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV). Though DC and AC power were unavailable, the RCIC System was able to operate for 70 hours. One reason for this may be lowered efficiency due to moisture carryover in the steam line. The events of the plants which were operating at Fukushima Daiichi have been modelled using several computational codes. Instrument data is limited due {{to the loss of}} electrical power, so assumptions were necessary. To more fully understand the events of Fukushima Daiichi Unit 2, it was desired to investigate the performance of a tangential flow impulse turbine under two-phase flow conditions. Estimation techniques have been made of the effect of two-phase injection on turbine performance, but these were also tested for this unique turbine design. A Terry turbine similar to those used in the RCIC Systems was installed in an experimental facility. The facility was equipped to inject compressed air or steam, along with a water component, into the inlet of the turbine. The turbine shaft work was measured by a water brake dynamometer. Dry and <b>wet</b> <b>mixes</b> from 60 g/s to 0 g/s were injected into the turbine down to the lower limit of operability. Torque, shaft work, and isentropic efficiency were obtained for 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 shaft revolutions per minute (RPM). The steam tests produced higher shaft work and torque than the air tests due to the higher enthalpy content of steam. Air, however, achieved similar isentropic efficiency to the steam tests. The 1912 approximations of Baumann for low-quality steam had good agreement with the results from tests using the <b>wet</b> <b>mixes...</b>|$|E

40|$|This work {{involves}} {{the development and}} analysis of a new pump packing material, which utilizes coal washery refuse (CWR) as a raw material, for strata control in underground coal mining operations. A review {{on the state of}} the of pump packing systems is presented, together with an analysis of the cost effectiveness of the new pump packing material as compared to other commercial pump packing materials. A method is proposed for use in the design of cement and coal washery refuse (CCWR) material mixes to give a required early strength and degree of workability when incorporating CWR. The usefulness of the method is shown by comparison of the results from a large number of tests on CCWR specimens with previously published results. It is shown that the relationship between the strength and curing time of a mix can be accurately described by a simple equation. The effects of the compositions on the strength within the experimental regions are discussed. As expected an increase in the strength of CCWR materials can be obtained either by decreasing the water content or increasing the quantity of OPC used in the mixtures. This study also investigated the influence of moisture content on the mechanical properties of CCWR material. The unconfined compressive strength, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, indirect tensile strength, triaxial strength and drying shrinkage were the primary properties investigated. Results indicate that the moisture content has a significant effect on both the strength and elasticity of CCWR material at all curing times. It is evident from the tests that the drying shrinkage of <b>wet</b> <b>mixes</b> is larger than that of dry mixes. In general, moisture content affects the shrinkage of CCWR material as it reduces the volume of the restraining CWR. An empirical criterion is proposed for predicting the strength and yield characteristics of CCWR materials. A numerical procedure has been developed to determine the parameters contained in the proposed yield function. It has been demonstrated that the proposed logarithmic yield function can accurately predict the strength and yield characteristics of CCWR materials. Preliminary tests have also been conducted to determine the influence of moisture content on the flow properties of CWR. The test results indicate that the presence of very fine grains in CWR enhances its flow ability remarkably. Further work investigated the effect of specimen geometry on the strength and elasticity of CCWR material. CCWR models were tested, simulating underground monolithic pack support with different widths in a coal seam of uniform height. The study also investigated the load deformation characteristics of CCWR models under the tests conditions. It is shown that geometry has a significant effect on both the mechanical properties and load deformation characteristics of CCWR models. A yield pillar technique analysed by the finite element method appears suitable for simulation of excavation of roadways under different virgin stress conditions. Comparison of stability of yield and conventional pillars in several examples substantiates the feasibility of the technique and indicates that yield pillars are practical when the factor k, the ratio of horiwntal to vertical stress exceeds 1. 6...|$|E

In comparison with the unreinforced Cu, Cu–GNP composites were lighter, and their hardness and Young’s modulus were higher as a consequence of graphene addition. According to the microstructural observation of pure copper and its composites after sintering, it was concluded that grain refinement is the main mechanism of strengthening in this research.

The feed industry standard is a %CV of less than 10 using a single source tracer such as salt, trace minerals or iron filings. The {{uniformity of}} mix can be affected by many factors including ingredient properties, equipment design, mix time, sampling method, sample preparation and overall precision of method. The objectives of this thesis were to verify the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method and {{to determine the effect}} of extended mixing time, salt particle size, sample preparation, <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time, spray condition, application time of the liquid addition, percent liquid addition and mixer type on the uniformity of mix. The first experiment evaluated the effect of water temperature, technician, extraction time, dissolution time on the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The salt concentration was significantly affected by water temperature and dissolution time. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated the 60 ºC water temperature and the 30 s extraction time by stirring followed by immediately placing the strip into the solution after extraction should be used for the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The second experiment evaluated the effect of extended mix time, particle size of salt and sample preparation on the %CV. The extended mix time did not result in segregation (P > 0. 30). However, particle size of the salt and sample preparation significantly affected the uniformity of mix. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that the extended mix time of up to 60 minutes did not increase the %CV of the feed; the particle size of the salt used in the uniformity of mix test can significantly change the results of the test; and grinding the sample prior to analysis improved the precision of the Quantab® chloride titrator method when coarse salt is used in the manufacturing process. The third experiment evaluated the effect of <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time and the timing of the liquid addition using different spray conditions on the %CV. The <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time significantly changed the %CV of the mixture (P = 0. 0057). The use of a spray nozzle had no effect on the %CV of the feed mixture when a 1. 14 % of a 23 % saline solution was sprayed on to the feed (P = 0. 7435). The results of Experiment 3 indicated the <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time had a greater influence on the uniformity of mix than the type of nozzle used to apply the liquid; and the shorter liquid application time allowed more time for the mechanical shear of the ribbons and paddles to break up the agglomerated wet particles and distribute them throughout the feed mixture when the total time of the liquid addition plus <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time was fixed. The fourth experiment evaluated the effect of different percent liquid addition, application time and mixer type with different <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> times on the uniformity of mix. The %CV of feed mixed using a fixed <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time setting did not change when the percent liquid addition was increased, while the %CV of the feed mixed using a fixed total liquid mix time setting increased when increasing the percent liquid addition. The %CV of feed mixed with a ribbon mixer did not change when the liquid application time was decreased while the %CV of the feed mixed with a paddle mixer increased when decreasing the liquid application time. Differences were observed in the %CV based on the parameters of liquid cycle time, mixer type and mixer size. The results of Experiment 4 indicated the liquid addition time and the percent of liquid addition affected the uniformity of mix. The uniformity of liquid application should be tested with the highest percent liquid addition. Furthermore, application and <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> times should be determined for each mixer type and size to establish the optimal batch cycle...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{elucidate}} relations between parameters of solid-liquid interactions, of wet granulating conditions and physicomechanical properties of final dried granules. As parameters of solid-liquid interactions were selected the spreading coefficient, λ, the work of adhesion, Wa, the swelling and the sticking ability of the components. As granulating conditions were evaluated the resistance of <b>wet</b> <b>mixing,</b> expressed as torque exerted on the mixing vessel, and the consumption of granulation liquid, corresponding to optimal production of usable granulation (funicular agglomeration state). The final dried granules were characterised {{on the basis of}} their size, shape, friability and content uniformity, as well as on their dissolution rate. Systems of single component powder (lactose and sulfadiazine) with different liquid (water, isopropanol, their mixture and paraffin) were initially examined. Then binary powder mixtures comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic components were studied and finally ternary mixtures containing different drugs (Naproxen, Diclofenac, Indomethacin and Ibuprofen) additional to the hydrophilic and hydrophobic component. Hydroxy-propyl-cellulose (HPC) and hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC) were employed as hydrophilic component and hydrogenated vegetable oil (Emvelop) as hydrophobic component. As granulating liquid was used water and isopropanol for the binary and isopropanol for the ternary powder mixes. From the study of single component powders, it was found that, for liquids of similar viscosity, the work of adhesion (Wa) is related to the amount of granulating liquid corresponding to the mean funicular agglomeration state, (S 3 + S 4) / 2 and to the tensile strength and resistance to densification of the wet agglomerates. No correlation was found between the torque and the parameters of solid-liquid interactions examined. This absence of correlation was attributed to the effect of micromeritic properties of wet agglomerates on the torque besides to that of the solid - liquid interactions. The study of binary powder mixes has shown that swellability of the hydrophilic component together with its content determine the consumption of granulating liquid. However, the <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> resistance seems to be dependent on both the sticking and the swelling ability of the components. Swelling in a relatively low degree might increase the sticking and result in increased torque (cases of HPC with water and isopropanol and case of HPMC with water). On the contrary, swelling in a relatively high degree might decrease the sticking and result in great increase of the torque (case of HPMC with isopropanol) due to the increased elasticity of swollen particles and greater contact area and stronger interparticle frictional forces. However, the granulating liquid consumption, for the binary systems, depends on the swellability, while the <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> resistance depends on the sticking ability and the elastic deformation of the swollen particles of the hydrophilic component. From the study of ternary powder mixes it was found that <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> resistance depends on the nature and the content of both the hydrophilic component and the drug incorporated. The consumption of granulating liquid (isopropanol) mainly depends on the content and the swellability of the hydrophilic component and on the solubility and wettability of the drug (third component). As far as the physicomechanical properties of the dried pharmaceutical granules are concerned, the swelling and sticking ability of the wetted solid components determined them. Granules of largest size and narrowest size distribution corresponded to HPMC, which shows highest swellability in isopropanol used as granulating liquid. Fluidity of HPC dissolved in isopropanol during the <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> resulted in the formation of granules with highest sphericity, while the great swelling and subsequent elastic deformation of HPMC resulted in granules of least shape uniformity and sphericity. Reduced friability of granules containing HPMC was observed, which was also attributed to higher swelling ability. Furthermore, intergranular porosity was higher for granules containing HPC due to their smaller size and wider size distribution, while the intragranular porosity was higher for granules containing HPMC, probably due to higher swelling ability and subsequent higher elastic deformation. ...|$|R
