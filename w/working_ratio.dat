The reason for the important increase of the unit cost in 2004 is not clear, but it could be due to the inauguration of the energy-intensive Río Lempa system that pumps water from the Rio Lempa to San Salvador in that year.|$|E

Our studies have already proposed a method of integrating ABC and process simulation in business process reengineering (BPR) and showed {{a case study of}} a chemical plant. Some studies have also already showed some examples of various aspects in manufacturing systems. Although a large number of studies have been made on product-mix/machine loading or scheduling, little is known about human planning based on workers ’ skills. In this paper, effective BPR methodologies to achieve dramatic improvements in business measures of workers ’ skills and costs based on ABC are discussed. First, two important tools: process simulation method and ABC analysis that can be customized by organizations for their own BPR are shown.

But papers concerning the SO 4 2 -/SnO 2 catalyst have been quite few, because of difficulty in preparation of the oxide gels from its salts SnCl 4. A highly dispersed light yellow powder, Sb-SnO 2 nanocrystal, was obtained by the synthesis method of “P-CNAIE ” and the drying method of “AD-IAA”. The Sb doping made the energy gap of nano-crystalline SnO 2 narrower. A saturated solution of ammonium sulfate was dropped into organic solutions containing a fixed amount of Sb-SnO 2 nano-powders in different ratio in order to load Sb-SnO 2 powder with ammonium sulfate. This method has an outstanding advantage that is the loading ratio of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 to Sb-SnO 2 can come to very high and no free water causes the aggregation of Sb-SnO 2 nano powder.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the effects of}} the {{indirect}} evaporative cooler with internal baffle on the performance of the hybrid air conditioning system are numerically investigated. The hybrid air conditioning system contains two indirect evaporative coolers with internal baffle, one is utilized to pre-cool the air inlet to the desiccant wheel and the other is utilized to pre-cool the supply air inlet to the room. The effects of the inlet conditions of the process and reactivation air and working air ratio on the thermal performance of the hybrid air conditioning system have been analyzed. The results of this study show that in the hybrid air conditioning system for using the indirect evaporative cooler with internal baffle as a pre-cooling unit, the supply air temperature reduced by 21 % and the coefficient of performance improved by 71 % as compared to previous designs of the hybrid air conditioning system at the same inlet conditions. For increasing process air inlet temperature from 25  °C to 45  °C, supply air temperature increases from 12. 7  °C to 14. 2  °C, thermal COP increases from 1. 87 to 2. 84, and supply air relative humidity increases from 76. 7 % to 77. 4 %. Also, for increasing the reactivation air inlet temperature from 70  °C to 110  °C, supply air temperature dropped from 15. 9  °C to 10. 9  °C, supply air relative humidity dropped from 82. 7 % to 71. 8 %, and thermal COP dropped from 4. 5 to 1. 7.

40|$|Analytical {{precision}} for Pb isotope measurement by thermal and {{plasma source}} mass spectrometry has improved by {{an order of}} magnitude in the last 20 years. Much of this improvement relates to a shift away from the external method of correcting instrumental mass fractionation – where samples are assumed to fractionate to the same extent as an average value of a working measurement standard. Implementation of a variety of techniques, including thallium spiking, sample–standard bracketing and double/triple spiking has provided more robust methods of fractionation correction. Isotope laboratories use {{one or more of these}} procedures, but an assessment of the measurement precision and relative merits of each system is needed to determine which is the most appropriate for the purpose. This study reviews each of these methods and provides a comparison based on an extensive analytical record covering 18 years, and using a variety of mass spectrometers. As two or three of the methods have been applied to most measurements, direct and robust comparisons can be made between correction protocols. In particular the effects of sample purity and variable sample matrices on measurement precision and accuracy have been examined. Data acquired from the measurement of rock, soil and metal are used to provide a statistical comparison of the analytical uncertainty of each technique, guiding the choice of the most appropriate method.
