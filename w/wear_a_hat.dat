Zaitsev told Zhizn that {{it took some time}} to convince Putina to <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> due to Russian women in general not wearing them.|$|E
25|$|Crosby {{would spend}} hours sunbathing naked atop the mill's turret. Contrary to fashion of the day, {{he would not}} <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat.</b> He often wore a black {{carnation}} in his lapel, and was known to color his finger- and toenails. Crosby once hired four horse-drawn carriages and raced them through the Paris streets. He would frequently drop in at Drosso where he would smoke opium. He would stay {{away from home for}} days.|$|E
50|$|However, some languages, such as Japanese and Chinese, can use finite verbs attributively. In such a language, the man <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> might translate, word-for-word, {{into the}} <b>wears</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> man. Here, the {{function}} of an attributive adjective is played by the phrase <b>wears</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> which is headed by the finite verb <b>wears.</b> This is <b>a</b> kind of relative clause.|$|R

25|$|According to tradition, Jewish men, {{married or}} not, must cover their heads. The most common head {{covering}} is the kippah (Hebrew: skull cap), known as yarmulke in Yiddish. Orthodox men wear something {{on their heads}} at almost all times, while non-Orthodox men may cover their heads only when performing some religious act, or when eating. Few cover the entire head. Almost all will bathe with the head uncovered, but sleeping varies by community or family practice. The exact nature of this practice, and how binding it is, {{is a matter of}} dispute among halakhic authorities. Wearing a hat is not required by Jewish law, and those who <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> always wear a kippah underneath; however, there are some rabbis, especially in Hasidic Judaism, who require a double head covering - of kippah and hat or tallis - during prayer.|$|E
25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E

Tennessee Walking Horses are typically shown with a long mane and tail.

500|$|Fanciful {{tales of}} peers with {{whimsical}} privileges circulate, {{such as that}} of the right to <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> {{in the presence of the}} Sovereign. [...] The most persistent example of such a legend is that of the Kingsale hat. According to the fable, John de Courcy, Earl of Ulster, obtained from King John the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. Though the tale is untrue—de Courcy was never made an earl and did not receive such a privilege—several authorities on the peerage have seen fit to repeat it. A 19th-century edition of Burke's Peerage suggests the origins of the privilege: ...|$|E

Maybe Gerry should run around more." [...] Ryan unsuccessfully pleaded with RTÉ to cancel midway through the series. Gerry Ryan Tonight was a chat show that aired two nights per week. Ryan describes it as [...] "no less traumatic" [...] as it nearly cost him his close personal friendship with the producer Ferdia McAnna.|$|E

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a phone call}} from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami. She goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a [...] "monster", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood. Realizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him. Yutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night. Yutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho. However, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance. Though Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyway and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho. [...] It is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat.</b> At the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow. Seeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process. Yuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka. Miho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and {{make their way to the}} local bath house. Just before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand. The pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.|$|E
