5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II to {{his death}} in April 1985, Enver Hoxha pursued a style of {{politics}} informed by hardline Stalinism as well as elements of Maoism. He broke with the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev embarked on his reformist Khrushchev Thaw, withdrew Albania from the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> in 1968 in protest of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia, and broke with the People's Republic of China after U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact.</b> The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact,</b> the game will begin in eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{forgotten}} in {{coverage of the}} summit was that six new members from the former <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> – Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania – joined NATO in March 2004 and were formally welcomed into the Alliance.|$|E
5000|$|Front Command, in Warsaw (would {{have formed}} the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact’s</b> Northern Front with an {{authorized}} strength of 205,620 soldiers in wartime) ...|$|R
50|$|In the People's Republic of Poland, on 8 September 1968, Ryszard Siwiec immolated {{himself in}} Warsaw during a harvest festival at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium in {{protest against the}} <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia and the totalitarianism of the Stalinist government. Siwiec did not survive.|$|R
50|$|In 1950 Geremek {{joined the}} Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). He {{was the second}} {{secretary}} of the Basic Party Organisation (POP) of the PZPR at Warsaw University. In 1968, however, he withdrew from the party in protest against the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia.|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War, the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> {{countries}} {{launched a}} widespread {{war against the}} potato beetle, blaming {{the introduction of the}} species from America on the CIA, demonising the species in propaganda posters, and urging children to gather the beetles and kill them.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{after the}} {{unsuccessful}} Czechoslovak attempt to liberalise the Communist regime, {{the city was}} occupied by <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> troops. Shortly thereafter, it became capital of the Slovak Socialist Republic, {{one of the two}} states of the federalized Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war. This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.|$|E
5000|$|When the Reagan {{administration}} {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Soviet Union requiring each side to withdraw intermediate-range missiles from Europe, General Rogers called the agreement [...] "foolish." [...] He said the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> superiority in foot soldiers and conventional weapons left NATO forces {{at risk of being}} quickly overrun.|$|R
50|$|TRADOC {{concluded}} {{that there were two}} main possibilities for future conflicts, a major armored conflict in Europe, or a primarily infantry fight in other locations around the world. The latter possibility led to the ill-fated Rapid Reaction Force. The former was more problematic given the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> massive numerical superiority, especially given the ending of Selective Service.|$|R
40|$|For NATO's {{first four}} decades the {{overwhelming}} {{threat to its}} members' security arose from the enormous military strength of the Soviet Union … the allies were unable to match the numerical levels of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> conventional armaments and manpower. This … underlined the key role of nuclear weapons in deterrence, ensuring {{that the cost of}} aggression was plainly too high for any attacker to contemplate...|$|R
5|$|While Stalin's {{death in}} 1953 {{slightly}} relaxed tensions, {{the situation in}} Europe remained an uneasy armed truce. The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact,</b> in 1955.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} voiceovers called STRIKE Files outline {{the origins of}} STRIKE. One such file has the Security Czar {{detailing}} the organization's mandate to US President Bill Clinton after his inauguration in January 1993. In the tape, Clinton is unaware that STRIKE prevented a civil war in Mexico in 1982 which could have turned the country into a secret <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> member-state.|$|E
5|$|Armenian SSR, as a Soviet republic, was internationally {{recognized}} by the United Nations {{as part of the}} Soviet Union but it had Norair Sisakian as President of the 21st session of the UNESCO General Conference in 1964. The Soviet Union was also a member of Comecon, <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> and the International Olympic Committee.|$|E
50|$|That same year, {{after the}} <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> {{squelching}} of the Prague Spring, he, his wife Olga, {{and their daughter}} Ruth left Prague for exile, first in Vienna, and later, from 1969, in the USA. The overwhelmingly positive response in Europe to the German edition of his critical work on Nestroy was the effectual cause of his being offered a professorship at Pennsylvania State University.|$|R
40|$|This work {{considers}} questions, why {{the prevention}} of attempt to socialism with a human face in Czechoslovakia took place in 1968. The work sequentially makes a statement on then political mentality in that era {{as well as it}} considers the outer influences that led to an army intervention of <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> lands into Czechoslovakia in August 1968. The work should answer the following question, why the break of sub political progress came true that consequently aimed at the normalization orientation...|$|R
50|$|Starry {{emphasized}} the close coordination between the Army and Air Force {{to produce an}} integrated attack plan that would use the land forces in a counter-blitz while air power, artillery and special operation forces stopped {{the movement of the}} reserves toward the front line. The result would stretch out the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> advance in time, allowing the smaller NATO forces to continually attrit the enemy all along the battlefield while the reinforcements arrived piecemeal. The result was a single AirLand Battle.|$|R
5|$|Comet 2R: Three Comet 2s were {{modified}} {{for use in}} {{radar and}} electronic systems development, initially assigned to No. 90 Group (later Signals Command) for the RAF. In service with No. 192 and No. 51 Squadrons, the 2R series was equipped to monitor <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> signal traffic and operated in this role from 1958.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried the beetle as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a Warsaw Pact-wide campaign {{to wipe out the}} beetle, villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling schoolchildren from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E
5|$|In {{answer to}} the Prague Spring, on 20 August 1968, the Soviet Army, {{together}} with most of their <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> allies, invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion {{was followed by a}} wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European communist parties.|$|E
50|$|The task of NAVBALTAP was to {{keep the}} <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> United Baltic Sea Fleets, {{consisting}} of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, Polish Navy and East German Volksmarine bottled up in the Baltic Sea by blocking the Danish straits and thus ensuring NATOs unchallenged control of the North Sea. To fulfill its mission NAVBALTAP commanded the entire German as well as the ships of the Danish Navy based in Denmark. The ships based in Greenland and the Faroe islands were under the command of Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 Kukliński {{said that}} his {{awareness}} of the [...] "unambiguously offensive" [...] nature of Soviet military plans was {{an important factor in}} his decision to communicate the details of those plans to the United States, adding that [...] "Our front could only be a sacrifice of Polish blood at the altar of the Red Empire". [...] Kukliński was also concerned that his homeland would be turned into a nuclear wasteland as the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> superiority in conventional forces would mean NATO would respond to military action with tactical nuclear weapons.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the day of}} {{the twenty-first}} anniversary of the Communist {{takeover}} (25 February 1969), he travelled to Prague accompanied by three other students. His intention was to warn the public against the forthcoming political [...] "normalization" [...] of the country. He had several letters challenging the people to fight against the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> military occupation of Czechoslovakia. Around 1:30 in the afternoon he walked into the passageway of the building at No. 39 on Wenceslas Square and ignited his chemical-soaked clothes. He was unable to run out of the door, and collapsed and died in the hallway.|$|R
5|$|After the war {{the gun was}} {{supplied}} to many countries around the globe, including former <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> allies, such as Poland. As of the early 2000s it remains in service in Afghanistan, Albania, China, Cuba, Hungary, Iraq, Mozambique, Syria, Vietnam and other countries. The gun was employed in the Arab-Israeli Conflict and also in some conflicts in former republics of Soviet Union. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in the national armies of numerous countries is an additional testimony to its qualities.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, {{to combat the}} threat posed by the Soviet Navy and other fleets of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact.</b> It ceased to exist in 1969 when it was subsumed into the newly formed Strike Command, which had also absorbed the former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later also absorbed Air Support Command, the former Transport Command.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia. He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield's proposal to bring {{the matter of the}} Vietnam War before the United Nations. Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Romanian Army used mostly PPSh-41, Oriţa submachine guns and {{imported}} AK-47 rifles. With {{the development of}} the stamped Type 4 AKM receiver, and the Soviet Union's call to each of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> nations to produce their own assault rifles chambered in 7.62mm, be they AK-47 pattern or not, the Romanian State Arsenal developed an AKM clone featuring a forward-pointing front handgrip molded into the lower handguard, called the Pistol Mitralieră model 1963 (literally 'machine pistol' model 1963). The underfolding stock version is designated the Pistol Mitralieră model 1965, and features a rear-pointing front handgrip, allowing the underfolding stock to be completely retracted.|$|R
5000|$|As the Israeli-Arab Six-Day War {{started on}} June 5, 1967, the Polish Politburo met the {{following}} day and made policy determinations, declaring condemnation of [...] "Israel's aggression" [...] and full support for the [...] "just struggle of the Arab countries". Gomułka and Cyrankiewicz then went to Moscow on June 9 for a Middle East conference of communist leaders. The participants deliberated in a depressed atmosphere. The decisions made included the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> continuation of military and financial support for the Arab states and the breaking of diplomatic relations with Israel, in which only Romania refused to participate. The events of 1967 altered the relatively correct relations between People's Poland and Israel.|$|R
5|$|Rhodesian {{air traffic}} was not seriously {{threatened}} until about 1977, {{in the latter}} stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launcher, supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s {{as part of the}} <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> materiel support. By September 1978, there had been 20reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War.|$|R
5|$|Battlefield Germany is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 released in April 1987. It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during a fictional scenario in which the powers of NATO and the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> engage in a conventional war throughout Europe, mostly centring in West and East Germany.|$|E
5|$|Despite the evident {{conflicts}} between amateurism and the Soviet {{system in which}} athletes received stipends, jobs, and housing at state expense, Brundage took no action against the USSR or <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> nations with similar systems; when challenged on this point, he argued that Western nations had similar abuses, such as athletic scholarships. The Soviet system remained in place, though Western nations reacted by giving their athletes greater state support.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{was little}} more than a {{political}} association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact,</b> that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.|$|E
50|$|Together with German Fleet {{under the}} Flag Officer Germany (FOG) the Royal Danish Navy {{would have tried}} to keep the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> United Baltic Sea Fleets, {{consisting}} of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, Polish Navy and East German Volksmarine bottled up in the Baltic Sea by blocking the Danish straits and thus ensuring NATOs unchallenged control of the North Sea. Additionally NAVBALTAP was to prevent amphibious landings on the Danish coast. To fulfill its mission the navy fielded a large number of minelayers and fast attack crafts. The first would have been used to mine all sealanes and potential landings beaches, while the latter would have harassed the enemy fleet with continuous hit and run attacks.|$|R
5000|$|Kukliński {{was born}} in Warsaw to a working-class family with strong Catholic and socialist traditions. During World War II, his father {{became a member of}} the Polish {{resistance}} movement; he was captured by the Gestapo, and subsequently died in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After the war, Kukliński began a successful career in the Polish People's Army. In 1968, he took part in preparations for the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia. Disturbed by the invasion, and by the brutal crushing of the parallel Polish 1970 protests, in 1972, Kukliński sent a letter to the US embassy in Bonn describing himself as a foreign [...] "MAF" [...] from a Communist country, and requested a secret meeting.|$|R
5000|$|Trench warfare {{has been}} {{infrequent}} in recent wars. When two large armoured armies meet, {{the result has}} generally been mobile warfare of the type which developed in World War II. However, trench warfare reemerged in the latter stages of the Chinese Civil War (Huaihai Campaign), the Korean War (from July 1951 to its end), and at Dien Bien Phu and other later locations and engagements during the Vietnam War. During the Cold War, NATO forces routinely trained to fight through extensive works called [...] "Soviet-style trench systems", named after the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> complex systems of field fortifications, an extension of Soviet field entrenching practices {{for which they were}} famous in their Great Patriotic War. or the German-Soviet War by outside parties.|$|R
