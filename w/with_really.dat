500|$|The new {{creative}} team, {{while avoiding}} references aimed specifically at adults, {{was determined not}} to adapt the humour to children or otherwise patronise their audience. Instead, they sought to make the best use possible of the material. Norris said that her goal was [...] "to make a show that people would say was too good for children... we started out <b>with</b> <b>really</b> high ambitions." [...] To that end, adult historical satires such as Blackadder and the Monty Python films were shown at the first writers' meeting to demonstrate the proposed tone, and these influences would be visible throughout the show's run.|$|E

500|$|Not all non-video game {{publications}} {{gave the}} same {{praise for the}} game. [...] Common Sense Media gave it all five stars and called it [...] "a perfect game {{for a bunch of}} teenagers to play because it's wacky, fast-paced, and just plain fun." [...] However, Maxim gave it a score of seven out of ten and stated that [...] "With matches of five-on-five taking place on small fields <b>with</b> <b>really</b> basic controls, Strikers is classic arcade-style soccer, but the game gets an extra kick from power-ups, random Bowser attacks, and a Telemundo-style announcer." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a similar score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "immediately likable".|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the film}} only the tagline [...] "A love {{story in the}} city of dreams", David Lynch has refused to comment on Mulholland Drives meaning or symbolism, leading to much {{discussion}} and multiple interpretations. The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director [...] "insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like Lost Highway. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, [...] "I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want. He loves it when people come up <b>with</b> <b>really</b> bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious." ...|$|E
500|$|... "And Then We Kiss" [...] is {{four minutes}} and twenty-eight seconds long. It is an euro-trance song with {{influences}} of techno and usage of synthesizers. The song blends dance-rock guitars and symphonic strings and closes with an orchestral overtone. Its lyrics {{talk about a}} kiss and the different sensations that the protagonist experiences, including trembling, crying and moaning. At the beginning she sings the lines [...] "Lying alone / touching my skin" [...] which suggest that the whole song may actually be a fantasy. Spears's vocals are much less prominent than on the original version. In an interview with About.com, Junkie XL {{said he wanted to}} turn the song [...] "into a 2006 version of Enjoy the Silence <b>with</b> <b>really</b> electronic chunky beats and nice melodic guitar lines. Besides the fact that 's singing on it, it could be a track off my album because it's the same vibe. I'm really happy with the end result and so are they." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO. The group had also planned to tour in Israel and Australia following their European tour, but refused to do so, as they had been away from home for three weeks and found the tour [...] "rigorous". Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of our music. When we discovered that, we realized that the music we were working <b>with</b> <b>really</b> was universal, that we didn't have to think of a particular market. People everywhere like to dance, sweat and party, and they like the same kind of sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just {{thought it would be fun}} to make a [...] "really scary film <b>with</b> <b>really</b> scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot using the video mode of two Canon EOS 5D Mark II and one Canon EOS 1D Mark IV digital single-lens reflex cameras, which helped the filmmakers {{look more like}} typical park visitors. To {{compensate}} for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in monochrome mode. [...] "e were shooting <b>with</b> <b>really</b> fast lenses wide open, so our depth of field was razor thin. Black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition, since we were doing almost everything in camera and didn't use a focus puller," [...] Moore recalled. It was an irreversible choice. [...] "ecause the 5D doesn't shoot RAW, we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn't go back to color, {{even if we had}} wanted to." [...] Moore was comfortable with the result because of the surrealistic, dreamlike quality it created, forcing viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a new way.|$|E

500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch {{to see if we could}} find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts that had to do <b>with</b> <b>really</b> big visual pictures. But I wanted to start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E
500|$|The I EP {{contains}} a single, 21-minute song of complex arrangements {{and was a}} hint of the forthcoming album, 2005's Catch Thirtythree. The EP, which was never played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal. On Catch Thirtythree, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001's compilation Rare Trax. The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger. Hagström notes, [...] "The eight-strings really have given us a whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can't play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up <b>with</b> <b>really</b> unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings. We wanted to get as far away from any kind of conventions and traditions as we could on the album, so the guitars worked out beautifully." ...|$|E
500|$|Amiga Format {{stated that}} this [...] "fine {{adventure}} game well worth investigating" [...] could compete with Sierra and LucasFilm games; [...] "in any event, Temptress surpasses almost anything Sierra have offered, by being larger, funnier, {{and a whole}} lot better drawn ... an innovative system knocks spots of the Sierra-standards and shows LucasFilm a thing or two" [...] and also praised its humour, saying that there's [...] "a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humour and fairy-tale nonsense." [...] The One praised the game's controls, saying that [...] "the game's impressive user-friendliness is undoubtably one of its strong points," [...] adding that [...] "Lure of the Temptress is every bit as professional and polished as anything the Americans and French have been able to offer us recently" [...] but [...] "Lure is, if anything, a little too serious and sombre" [...] and that [...] "LucasFilm's games boast the more interesting characters and interaction sequences." [...] Amiga Power praised its graphics, saying they are [...] "very pretty drawn, with the dark, moody look you'd expect from a town being oppressed by an evil Temptress," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best graphic adventures ever" [...] that's [...] "up there with Monkey Island 1 and Beneath a Steel Sky," [...] and adding that the [...] "only drawback is that it's shorter than your average adventure." [...] Mega Zone praised the game, stating that it is a [...] "Sierra/Lucasfilmish <b>with</b> <b>really,</b> really good playability. We're talking 32 colours graphics which look really nice, with playability which is really smooth, and simply pure gaming enjoyment here," [...] adding that [...] "the manual is very well written, the sound the graphics are all there, disc access is very good, and looking at the way the whole game is put together right down to the intro it's one of the most amazing Amiga Adventures every written! An Adventure Zone classic!" [...] Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power opined that Core Design's rival 1992 fantasy adeventure game Curse of Enchantia (also published by Virgin) was [...] "a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot." ...|$|E

[...] The album includes references to several religious figures of Christianity, notably Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalene, and Jesus of Nazareth. Several songs on the album give reference to sexuality and feminism. Other themes referenced in the album include individualism, equality, and freedom.|$|E
