40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of 1852 retrospectively evaluated patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC), a scoring system was developed to predict survival. This study was performed to validate the scoring system in a new data set. The score included 6 prognostic factors: tumor type, interval between tumor diagnosis and MSCC, other bone or visceral metastases, ambulatory status, and duration of motor deficits. Scores ranged between 20 and 45 points, and patients were initially divided into 5 groups: <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 20 to 25 points, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 26 to 30 points, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 31 to 35 points, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 36 to 40 points, and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 41 to 45 points. To facilitate the clinical use of the score, the patients were regrouped into 3 groups: <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 20 to 30 points, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 31 to 35 points, and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 36 to 45 points. In this study, data of 439 new patients were included who were divided into the same prognostic groups as in the preceding study. In this study, the 6 -month survival rates were 7 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 20 - 25 points), 19 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 26 - 30 points), 56 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 31 - 35 points), 73 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 36 - 40 points), and 90 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 41 - 45 points), respectively (P <. 0001). After regrouping, the 6 -month survival rates were 14 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 20 - 30 points), 56 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 31 - 35 points), and 80 % (for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> 36 - 45 points), respectively, in this study (P <. 0001). In the current study, the difference in 6 -month survival between the prognostic groups {{was found to be}} as significant as in the preceding study. Thus, this scoring system was considered valid to estimate survival of MSCC patients. The system could have been simplified by including only 3 instead of 5 prognostic group...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of research were to find out: (1) which learning model provided better student learning achievement, Problem based Learning (PBL) or Numbered Heads Together (NHT) type of Cooperative Learning or direct learning model, (2) which students had better mathematics learning achievement, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> auditory, or visual, or kinesthetic learning style, (3) in each learning model, which one had mathematics learning achievement better, whether the students <b>with</b> auditory, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> visual or <b>those</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic learning style, (4) in each learning style, which one provided better mathematics learning achievement, Problem based Learning (PBL) or Numbered Heads Together (NHT) type of Cooperative Learning or direct learning model. This {{study was a}} quasi experimental research with a 3 x 3 factorial design. The population of research was all of the VII graders of Junior High Schools in Pacitan Regency. The sample was taken using stratified cluster random sampling. The sample of research consisted of 242 students: 82 students for the experiment 1, 80 students for experiment 2 and 80 students for control classes. Considering the result of hypothesis testing, the following conclusions could be drawn. (1) The Problem Based Learning, the NHT type of cooperative learning, and direct learning models provided equal mathematics learning achievement. (2) The students with visual learning style had the mathematics learning achievement equal to <b>those</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic one. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> visual learning style had the mathematics learning achievement better than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> auditory one. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic learning style had the mathematics learning achievement better than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> auditory one. (3) In PBL learning model, the students with visual learning style had the mathematics learning achievement better than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> auditory one, but <b>those</b> <b>with</b> visual learning style had the mathematics learning achievement equal to <b>those</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic one, and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> auditory learning style had the mathematics learning achievement equal to <b>those</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic one. In NHT type of cooperative learning model, the students with visual learning style had the mathematics learning achievement equal to <b>those</b> <b>with</b> auditory one and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> visual learning style had the mathematics learning achievement equal to <b>those</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic one, but <b>those</b> <b>with</b> auditory learning style had the mathematics learning achievement better than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic one.
