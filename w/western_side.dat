5|$|A {{well-developed}} tropical wave exited Africa on August 27. The next day, {{it developed}} into a tropical depression, and shortly thereafter it intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. On August 29, it passed just south of Cape Verde as it continued intensifying on its west-northwest track. An eye feature appeared in the convection on August 31, suggesting winds of near hurricane status; since the feature was located on the <b>western</b> <b>side</b> of the deep convection and the storm was slightly asymmetric, the intensity was held just below hurricane status. Shortly after, strong wind shear caused the storm to deteriorate, leaving the low-level circulation exposed on the <b>western</b> <b>side.</b> Beryl weakened to a tropical depression the next day {{due to the lack}} of convection, and it continued westward without redevelopment. On September 5, a reconnaissance flight into the depression found winds of 65mph (100km/h); this was deemed unrepresentative of the actual intensity as it was recorded in a squall line. The depression became disorganized once more and by September 6, it was no longer identifiable on satellites.|$|E
