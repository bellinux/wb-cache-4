Testing {{group consisted of}} professional golfers. <b>Weight</b> <b>transfer</b> was measured by two plattens KISTLER a kinematics of movement was observed by kinematic analysartor CODA motion system. The analysis of interindividual and intraindividual stability was based on data collected during the testing of professional golf players. Results High interindiviual and intraindividual stability of execution was proved due to parametres <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> and accuracy. It was proved that capability of accuracy and stability of execution <b>weight</b> <b>transfering</b> is decreasing alongside with longer distance. For description of <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> critical phazes of movement were estabilished.

50|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>transfer</b> {{occurs as}} the vehicle's CoM shifts during {{automotive}} maneuvers. Acceleration causes the sprung mass to rotate about a geometric axis resulting in relocation of the CoM. Front-back <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> {{is proportional to}} the change in the longitudinal location of the CoM to the vehicle's wheelbase, and side-to-side <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> (summed over front and rear) {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the change in the CoM's lateral location to the vehicle's track.|$|R
50|$|Sprung <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> is the <b>weight</b> <b>transferred</b> by {{only the}} weight of the vehicle resting on the springs, not the total vehicle weight. Calculating this {{requires}} knowing the vehicle's sprung weight (total weight less the unsprung weight), the front and rear roll center heights and the sprung center of gravity height (used to calculate the roll moment arm length). Calculating the front and rear sprung <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> will also require knowing the roll couple percentage.|$|R

50|$|By way of example, when {{a vehicle}} accelerates, a <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> {{toward the rear}} wheels can occur. An outside {{observer}} might witness this as the vehicle visibly leans to the back, or squats. Conversely, under braking, <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> {{toward the front of}} the car can occur. Under hard braking it might be clearly visible even from inside the vehicle as the nose dives toward the ground (most of this will be due to load transfer). Similarly, during changes in direction (lateral acceleration), <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> to the outside of the direction of the turn can occur.|$|R
50|$|The {{roll axis}} {{is the line}} through {{the front and rear}} roll centers that the vehicle rolls around during cornering. The {{distance}} from this axis to the sprung center of gravity height is the roll moment arm length. The total sprung <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> is equal to the G-force times the sprung weight times the roll moment arm length divided by the effective track width. The front sprung <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> is calculated by multiplying the roll couple percentage times the total sprung <b>weight</b> <b>transfer.</b> The rear is the total minus the front transfer.|$|R

40|$|Deep {{learning}} {{has become a}} promising approach for automated medical diagnoses. When medical data samples are limited, collaboration among multiple institutions is necessary to achieve high algorithm performance. However, sharing patient data often has limitations due to technical, legal, or ethical concerns. In such cases, sharing a deep learning model is a more attractive alternative. The best method of performing such a task is unclear, however. In this study, we simulate the dissemination of learning deep learning network models across four institutions using various heuristics and compare the results with a deep learning model trained on centrally hosted patient data. The heuristics investigated include ensembling single institution models, single <b>weight</b> <b>transfer,</b> and cyclical <b>weight</b> <b>transfer.</b> We evaluated these approaches for image classification in three independent image collections (retinal fundus photos, mammography, and ImageNet). We find that cyclical <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> resulted in a performance (testing accuracy = 77. 3 %) that was closest to that of centrally hosted patient data (testing accuracy = 78. 7 %). We also found {{that there is an}} improvement in the performance of cyclical <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> heuristic with high frequency of <b>weight</b> <b>transfer...</b>|$|R

Purpose {{was to examine}} differences within a highly skilled group of baseball batters to use visual information to guide <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> and bat movements. One batter who played at Major League Baseball (MLB) level was compared to five batters who played at Australian Baseball League (ABL) level in a case-control design.

50|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>{{transfer}}</b> {{and load}} transfer are two expressions used somewhat confusingly to describe two distinct effects: {{the change in}} load borne by different wheels of even perfectly rigid vehicles during acceleration, and the change in center of mass (CoM) location relative to the wheels because of suspension compliance or cargo shifting or sloshing. In the automobile industry, <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> customarily refers to the change in load borne by different wheels during acceleration. This is more properly referred to as load transfer, {{and that is the}} expression used in the motorcycle industry, while <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> on motorcycles, to a lesser extent on automobiles, and cargo movement on either is due to a change in the CoM location relative to the wheels.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} disorder on the dynamical spectrum of layered $f$-electron systems. With random dilution of $f$-sites in a single Kondo insulating layer, we explore the range and extent to which Kondo hole incoherence can penetrate into adjacent layers. We consider three cases of neighboring layers: band insulator, Kondo insulator and simple metal. The disorder-induced spectral <b>weight</b> <b>transfer,</b> used here for quantification of the proximity effect, decays algebraically with distance from the boundary layer. Further, we show that the spectral <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> is highly dependent on the frequency range considered {{as well as the}} presence of interactions in the clean adjacent layers. The changes in the low frequency spectrum are very similar when the adjacent layers are either metallic or Kondo insulating, and hence are independent of interactions. In stark contrast, a distinct picture emerges for the spectral <b>weight</b> <b>transfers</b> across large energy scales. The spectral <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> over all energy scales is much higher when the adjacent layers are non-interacting as compared to when they are strongly interacting Kondo insulators. Thus, over all scales, interactions screen the disorder effects significantly. We discuss the possibility of a crossover from non-Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid behavior upon increasing the ratio of clean to disordered layers in particle-hole asymmetric systems.

40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the physics of}} <b>weight</b> <b>transfer.</b> You will often hear instructors and drivers say that applying the brakes shifts weight {{to the front of}} a car and can induce oversteer. Likewise, accelerating shifts weight to the rear, inducing understeer, and cornering shifts weight to the opposite side, unloading the inside tires. But why does weight shift during these maneuvers? How can weight shift when everything is in the car bolted in and strapped down? Briefly, the reason is that inertia acts through the center of gravity (CG) of the car, which is above the ground, but adhesive forces act at ground level through the tire contact patches. The e#ects of <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> are proportional to the height of the CG o# the ground. A flatter car, one with a lower CG, handles better and quicker because <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> is not so drastic as it is in a high ca...|$|R

50|$|Current {{methods of}} {{analyzing}} individual wheel instant centers have yielded more intuitive {{results of the}} effects of non-rolling <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> effects. This type of analysis is better known as the lateral-anti method. This is where one takes the individual instant center locations of each corner of the car and then calculates the resultant vertical reaction vector due to lateral force. This value then is taken into account in the calculation of a jacking force and lateral <b>weight</b> <b>transfer.</b> This method works particularly well in circumstances where there are asymmetries in left to right suspension geometry.|$|R

This feature was controlled by electronic wheel-slip detection devices and an electric <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> relay, which reduced the anchor current to the leading bogie by as much as 50A in notches 2 to 16.|$|R
5000|$|Excessive load {{transfer}} - On any vehicle that is cornering, the outside wheels are more heavily loaded than the inside {{due to the}} CG being above the ground. Total <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> (sum of front and back), in steady cornering, {{is determined by the}} ratio of the height of a car's center of gravity to its axle track. When the <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> equals half the vehicle's loaded weight, it will start to roll over. This can be avoided by manually or automatically reducing the turn rate, but this causes further reduction in road-holding.|$|R

50|$|Roll rate is {{analogous}} to a vehicle's ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a vehicle's sprung mass to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass. It is influenced by factors including {{but not limited to}} vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of <b>weight</b> <b>transferred</b> on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> on that axle.|$|R
