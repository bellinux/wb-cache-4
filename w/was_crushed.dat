5|$|Atangana's {{appointment}} irritated {{members of}} the Bulu ethnic group. They feared they might one day lose German favour, or worse yet, fall under the dominion of the Ewondo. This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by Martin-Paul Samba, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> and Samba executed.|$|E

50|$|These beasts {{are much}} like the player; they can move blocks and can <b>be</b> <b>crushed.</b> The only {{advantage}} the player has to them is greater movement speed and hopefully wits. Although these foes don't need to <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> against a static block, {{the key is to}} hide behind a static block, making room behind the player (so he won't <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> by it), and let it come to his side of the static block. If the player is able to lure it properly, he should <b>be</b> able to <b>crush</b> it against the static block. While the hatched beasts are rightfully considered the hardest opponent, they may also be helpful; any beast trapped between something and a block he pushes will <b>be</b> <b>crushed.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} pharmacist interventions in the adaptation of pharmaceutical forms in elders institutionalized in nursing 	homes whose medicines <b>are</b> <b>crushed,</b> which may have a clinical relevance. Methods: Quasi-experimental, multicenter, transversal and 	prospective study carried out in 10 nursing homes. Subjects for whom drugs <b>were</b> being <b>crushed</b> <b>were</b> identified. Their treatments were reviewed {{in order to identify}} drugs that should not <b>be</b> <b>crushed.</b> In these cases, we proposed an alternative to the physician and we evaluated the degree of acceptance, its association to other variables and the pre-post adaptation index (tablets that can <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> and capsules that can be opened/ total number of tablets and capsules before and after the intervention). Moreover, health professionals received a training course. Results: Medication <b>was</b> being <b>crushed</b> for 33...|$|R

5|$|Ahmose I's {{campaigns in}} Nubia are better documented. Soon {{after the first}} Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but <b>was</b> <b>crushed.</b> After this attempt, an anti-Theban Egyptian named Tetian {{gathered}} many rebels in Nubia, but he too was defeated. Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new administrative center established at Buhen. When re-establishing the national government, Ahmose appears to have rewarded various local princes who supported his cause {{and that of his}} dynastic predecessors.|$|E

The triumvirate expired {{on the last day}} of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, war began again. At the Battle of Actium, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and Cleopatra in a naval battle near Greece, using fire to destroy the enemy fleet.|$|E

5|$|Emperor Caracalla, {{the son of}} Severus, {{marched on}} Parthia in 217 AD from Edessa to begin a war against them, but he was assassinated while on the march. In 224 AD, the Parthian Empire <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> not by the Romans but by the rebellious Persian vassal king Ardashir I, who revolted, leading to the {{establishment}} of Sassanid Empire of Persia, which replaced Parthia as Rome's major rival in the East.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{repeating the}} devolved {{arrangements}} of previous treaties, Edward chose to permanently colonise North Wales instead. The remaining royal family of Llwelyn and Dafydd <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> and their lands divided amongst major English nobles. The governance of Wales was reformed, and the arrangements {{set out in}} the Statute of Rhuddlan, enacted on 3March 1284. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west: Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey.|$|E

5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds blew away roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One man was electrocuted while another man <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to have died and 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby Bataan after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in Bataan were due to drownings; the city was also the hardest hit by the storm. Throughout the area near Bataan, 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E

In response, TiE promised to carry out repairs and Edinburgh Trams agreed to fund special training for cyclists., but the repairs were insufficient: in 2017, a woman <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> to death by a passing bus when her bicycle wheel {{was caught in the}} tracks. Further {{safety concerns}} were raised by residents along the routes about the suspension of overhead electric cables from residential buildings, and some property owners refused permission for cables to be attached.|$|E
5|$|Eureka Stockade, 3 December – The Eureka Stockade on 3 December {{has had a}} {{long history}} as an {{alternative}} choice for Australia Day, having been proposed by The Bulletin in the 1880s. The Eureka uprising occurred in 1854 during the Victorian gold rush, and saw a failed rebellion by the miners against the Victorian colonial government. Although the rebellion <b>was</b> <b>crushed,</b> it led to significant reforms, and has been described as being the birthplace of Australian democracy. Supporters of the date have included senator Don Chipp and former Victorian Premier Steve Bracks. However, the idea has been opposed by both hard-left unions and right-wing nationalist groups, both of whom claim symbolic attachment to the event, and by some who see it as an essentially Victorian event.|$|E

On 1 January, 89, the {{governor}} of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, revolted against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} a tribe of the Chatti. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. Within twenty-four days the rebellion <b>was</b> <b>crushed,</b> and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front of Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.|$|E

According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and {{early the next morning}} the revolt <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway. Guðrøðr may very well have been slain in the defeat, although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, states that he, his wife and his followers escaped the carnage to Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1394, {{relations}} between the Byzantines and the Ottomans changed for the worse and the war between the two resumed when the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid (ruled 1389–1402) ordered the execution of Manuel II after the Emperor attempted to reconcile his nephew John VII. The Ottoman Sultan then later changed his decision and demanded that a mosque and a Turkish colony be established in Constantinople. Manuel II not only refused this, he also refused to pay the Sultan tribute and {{went so far as}} to ignore the Sultan's messages, leading to a siege of the city in 1394. Manuel II called for a Crusade, which came in 1396. Under the future Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, the Crusade <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> at Nicopolis in 1396.|$|E
5|$|In spring 548, {{he participated}} {{once more in}} Troglita's campaign, {{according}} to Corippus {{at the head of}} no less than 30,000 men, divided into units a thousand strong under a Berber dux each. This number possibly also includes Byzantine troops placed under Cutzinas' command as well. During the campaign, Cutzinas and the other Berber leaders were crucial in suppressing a near-mutiny of the Byzantine troops due to Antalas' scorched earth strategy. The Berbers' steadfast support enabled Troglita to overcome the crisis and lead his army against the forces of Carcasan and Antalas. Cutzinas fought in the ensuing Battle of the Fields of Cato, which was a decisive Byzantine victory: Carcasan fell, and the Berber revolt <b>was</b> <b>crushed</b> as Antalas and the surviving leaders submitted to Troglita.|$|E
