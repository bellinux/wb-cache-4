40|$|Here, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the wing kinematics and wing deformations of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria, Forskål) flying tethered in a wind tunnel. We filmed them using four high-speed digital video cameras, and used photogrammetry to reconstruct the motion of more than 100 identified points. Whereas the hindwing motions were highly stereotyped, the forewing motions showed considerable variation, consistent with a role in flight control. Both wings were positively cambered on the downstroke. The hindwing was cambered through an ‘umbrella effect’ whereby the trailing edge tension compressed the radial veins during the downstroke. Hindwing camber was reversed on the upstroke as the <b>wing</b> <b>fan</b> corrugated, reducing the projected area by 30 per cent, and releasing the tension in the trailing edge. Both the wings were strongly twisted from the root to the tip. The linear decrease in incidence along the hindwing on the downstroke precisely counteracts the linear increase in the angle of attack that would otherwise occur in root flapping for an untwisted wing. The consequent near-constant angle of attack is reminiscent of the optimum for a propeller of constant aerofoil section, wherein a linear twist distribution allows each section to operate at the unique angle of attack maximizing the lift to drag ratio. This implies tuning of the structural, morphological and kinematic parameters of the hindwing for efficient aerodynamic force production...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is situated in}} the field of Computational AeroAcoustics (CAA). The thesis focuses on the computation of the aerodynamic noise generated by turbulent flows around <b>wing,</b> <b>fan,</b> or propeller airfoils. The computation of the noise radiated from a device is the first step for designers to understand the acoustical characteristics and to determine the noise sources in order to modify the design toward having acoustically efficient products. As a case study, the broadband or trailing-edge noise emanating from a CD (Controlled-Diffusion) airfoil, belonging to a fan is studied. The hybrid methods of aeroacoustic are applied to simulate and predict the radiated noise. The necessary tools were researched and developed. The hybrid methods consist in two steps simulations, where the determination of the aerodynamic field is decoupled from the computation of the acoustic waves propagation to the far field, so {{the first part of this}} thesis is devoted to an aerodynamic study of the considered airfoil. In this part of the thesis, a complete aerodynamic study has been performed. Some aspects have been developed in the used in-house solver SFELES, including the implementation of a new SGS model, a new outlet boundary condition and a new transient format which is used to extract the noise sources to be exported to the acoustic solver, ACTRAN. The second part of this thesis is concerned with the aeroacoustic study where four methods have been applied, among them two are integral formulations and the two others are partial-differential equations. The first method applied is Amiet’s theory, implemented in Matlab, based on the wall-pressure spectrum extracted in a point near the trailing edge. The second method is Curle’s formulation. It is applied proposing two approaches; the first approach is the implementation of the volume and surface integrals in SFELES to be calculated simultaneously with the flow in order to avoid the storage of noise sources which requires a huge space. In the second approach, the fluctuating aerodynamic forces, already obtained during the aerodynamics simulation, are used to compute the noise considering just the surface sources. Finally, Lighthil and Möhring analogies have been applied via the acoustic solver ACTRAN using sources extracted via SFELES. Maps of the radiated noise are demonstrated for several frequencies. The refraction effects of the mean flow have been studied. Doctorat en Sciences de l'ingénieur et technologieinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

In particular this paper analyses the full assembly of a CFRP flap including wing track attachments ready to be tested a birdstrike scenario. Before to introduce the impact simulations on the entire flap, a dedicated model calibration, which fully reflect ASTM procedure of tensile and compression tests have been prepared and simulation results, have been compared with typical experimental tests expected for a CFRP material. Furthermore the dimensioning of the roller carriages, which are the links between the flap tracks, has represented a critical issue in the interference aspects between the flap and the wing box, then a detailed evaluation of the links allowed to size the fixture for a fullscale test case. Using of an iterative approach, all failure parameter requested have been properly tuned. Then the calibration impact projectile is introduced to study the interaction between the bird (equivalent gelatine) and the target including the equation of state and contacts. Flap object of this work is equipped on a medium rage turbojet aircraft of about one hundred twenty seats. The flap model is a single slotted flap fixed to the main component with two tracks respectively, staring from the wing root. The impact condition presents for all flap deflections not affected by <b>wing,</b> <b>fan</b> cowl and track shadow. This paper present the analysis of bird strike with flap assembled on wing tracks. For this particular topic, a dedicated session has been developed in order to apply the most representative track installation. Finally an extensive campaign of impacts were performed on the inboard flap. Particular attention on the track zones is dedicated when the flap is fully opened. These zones are very critical because failure of links is a failure of complete systems. Results of the impacts analysis are presented in terms of visual damage and history forces reaction on link and carriage. Moreover the strain of the most critical items will be surveyed (rear spar damage).

In the parasitic wasp Lariophagus distinguendus, male courtship behaviour consisting of <b>wing</b> <b>fanning,</b> antennal stroking of the female antenna, and head nodding stimulates female receptivity leading to copulation.
