5|$|About 82% of Americans live {{in urban}} areas (including suburbs); {{about half of those}} reside in cities with populations over 50,000. The US has {{numerous}} clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston). There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the <b>West</b> <b>or</b> South.

5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the <b>west</b> (<b>or</b> cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E
5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent {{about a third of the}} way down from the summit on the mountain's <b>west</b> <b>or</b> northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} that immortality could be achieved if one reached the lands of the Queen Mother of the <b>West</b> <b>or</b> Mount Penglai. Han-era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs. By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher Laozi (fl.6th century BC) was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout followers would confess their sins, ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the Daodejing.|$|E

5|$|Klein's {{division}} {{was part of}} the decisive defeat of the Austrian and Russian force at the subsequent Battle of Austerlitz three weeks later. Initially, his dragoons, assigned to support Friant's division, occupied a position of observation on the Marchfeld. The rest of his dragoons remained near Stockerau, just to the west of Vienna, and these dragoons, plus Louis-Nicolas Davout's, Fran√ßois Antoine Louis Bourcier's and Marc Antoine Beaumont's divisions of dragoons, formed a cordon between Pohrlitz and Pressburg, and could move either <b>west</b> <b>or</b> east, depending on the actions of the Archduke Charles or the Russian commander Kutuzov. Consequently, Klein's dragoons, held the road between Austerlitz and Vienna, eliminating a possible Austrian retreat.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} <b>West</b> <b>or</b> Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1932, the Piccadilly {{line was}} {{extended}} west {{from its original}} terminus at Hammersmith and shared the route with the District line to Ealing Common. From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line {{was replaced by the}} Piccadilly line, and from that date, District line trains from Acton Town ran only either to Hounslow <b>West</b> <b>or</b> to Ealing Broadway. On 9 January 1933 Piccadilly line trains, sharing with the District line, began serving Northfields on the Hounslow branch, and their service was extended to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933 but Piccadilly line trains did not call at South Ealing until 1935. District line services on the Hounslow branch were withdrawn on 9 and 10 October 1964 after which operations were provided by the Piccadilly line alone.|$|E

5|$|The Monmouth Rebellion, {{also known}} as The Revolt of the <b>West</b> <b>or</b> The West Country rebellion, {{was an attempt to}} {{overthrow}} James II, the Duke of York who had become King of England, Scotland, and Ireland upon the death of his elder brother Charles II on 6 February 1685. James II was a Roman Catholic, and some Protestants under his rule opposed his kingship. James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, an illegitimate son of Charles II, claimed to be rightful heir to the throne and attempted to displace James II.|$|E
5|$|Their {{motives for}} {{escaping}} evolved over time. Those who fled {{in the years}} shortly after the Wall was built had experienced the formerly open border first-hand and often had relatives in the <b>West</b> <b>or</b> had traveled there. By contrast, later escapees {{had grown up with}} the closed border, desired greater freedom and were dissatisfied with conditions in East Germany. Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of a request to emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the state authorities and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the <b>west</b> <b>or</b> the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson Smith has pointed out, that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting {{that they may not}} be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II {{as well as in the}} tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.|$|E

5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the <b>west</b> <b>or</b> southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on August15, the NHC began {{forecasting}} {{that the}} hurricane would make landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina within two days. Early on August16, the eye became better defined, although the feature diminished {{within a few}} hours, and the NHC {{was on the verge}} of downgrading Felix to tropical storm status. A break in the ridge allowed Felix to turn to the north, bringing it about 150mi (250km) east of the Outer Banks. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to a northeast drift, and there was initial uncertainty whether Felix would loop back to the <b>west</b> <b>or</b> recurve to the northeast. During this time, the system remained a minimal hurricane, maintaining a large eye about 60 to 80miles (95 to 130km) in diameter, but with weak convection due to cooler air. After the trough that turned Felix to the east-northeast bypassed it to the north, the hurricane turned to the southeast, executing a small loop while northwest of Bermuda. On August20, Felix weakened below hurricane intensity for the first time in nine days, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear. By that time, the convection was removed from the center, and another trough brought the storm to the northeast. While passing east of Newfoundland on August22, Felix became extratropical. The remnants continued to the northeast, eventually passing north of the United Kingdom on August25.|$|E
5|$|During Hershiser's streak he posted 59 IP, 0 runs, 31 hits, 38 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits, while Drysdale had posted 58 IP, 0 runs, 28 hits, 45 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits. Drysdale {{maintained}} {{the record for}} consecutive shutouts (6) because Hershiser did not pitch beyond the first 10 innings of his September 28 start because it lasted 16 innings. Hershiser's record was overshadowed because the 1988 Summer Olympics {{and the start of}} the 1988 National Football League season occurred at the same time. Los Angeles had two NFL teams at the time (Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders). Additionally, baseball fans were more concerned with pennant races. Furthermore, four of the final five games in the streak were played in the Pacific Time Zone, limiting the games' visibility {{to the rest of the}} country. Controversially, KTTV did not broadcast either the September 26 game in which the Dodgers clinched the NL <b>West</b> <b>or</b> the September 28 game in which Hershiser set the record.

5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270¬∞ <b>west</b> (<b>or</b> in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E
5|$|On November17, a typhoon {{originated}} west of Guam, which {{moved slowly}} to the <b>west</b> <b>or</b> west-northwest.

It moved northwestward at first, but recurved to the northeast away from Luzon, and was last reported on November24. On that same day, a typhoon was observed southeast of Guam and proceeded westward. The storm passed near Yap on November25 and later turned to the north. Two days later, a passing United States Navy ship encountered the storm. On November29, a storm passed near the Bonin Islands, but it was uncertain {{whether it was the}} first typhoon of the month near the Philippines or the storm that affected Yap.

5|$|The four {{lanes of}} I-35E pass through {{downtown}} Saint Paul {{in the center}} of the six lanes of I-94, with a short overlap occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th streets. Despite this short overlap, there is no weaving between the two highways, since an exit in each direction of I-35E‚Äîexit107A from I-35E north to I-94 east, and exit107B from I-35E south to I-94 west‚Äîtakes traffic that would move to the right in the overlap instead to the right of the entire roadway. There are no interchanges on the common segment, and no direct access from I-35E northbound to I-94 <b>west</b> <b>or</b> I-94 eastbound to I-35E south. Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection; Ayd Mill Road, further west, nears I-94 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights. Unlike the west split of I-35E and I-94, all ramps are present at the east split; among other uses, the I-35E southbound to I-94 east and I-94 westbound to I-35E north ramps carry traffic following US Highway10 (US10), which overlaps I-35E north of downtown, and truck traffic using the nearby Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid the parkway through the West Seventh neighborhood.|$|E
