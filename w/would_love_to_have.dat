5|$|Elle Bishop is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appeared on the}} American psychological thriller science fiction series Heroes, which aired on NBC from 2006 to 2010. The character was created by series creator Tim Kring and portrayed by actress Kristen Bell. Elle was created by Kring {{to act as a}} contrast {{to the rest of the}} characters, who had all recently found out they had abilities, whereas Elle had known her whole life. Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series Veronica Mars, was a fan of the series and had met up with the writers that informed her they <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her. Elle was one of the new characters introduced in the second season and according to contract, would continue on the series for at least 13 episodes into season three.|$|E

I {{would have to}} meet someone that I wanted {{to spend the rest}} of my life with. That's the only person who I would want to be the father of my children. Maybe that will never happen.

500|$|The {{character}} has proven popular with viewers and critics {{due to his}} aesthetically pleasing looks. A Daily Star reporter said McGregor's contract was extended because female viewers [...] "went mad for him." [...] Nate Micó of SX News praised the casting of McGregor, saying [...] "As the brooding Detective Mark Brennan, handsome actor Scott McGregor has bought a welcome dose of eye candy to Ramsay Street."

2500|$|Carpenter has {{described}} Halloween as: [...] "True crass exploitation. I {{decided to make}} a film I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where you walk down the corridor and things jump out at you." [...] The film has often been cited as an allegory on the virtue of sexual purity and the danger of casual sex, although Carpenter has explained that this was not his intent: [...] "It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Thanks for the Memory" [...] {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of keyboard, which, at the time, was new to a Slade single. The part was played on the {{recording}} by Lea, but the band <b>had</b> initially planned <b>to</b> use a session keyboardist. As Lea felt the part was quite complex, the band auditioned many different session players. However, the band felt {{that none of them}} could play it right so Lea ended up playing it himself. The song was originally titled [...] "Here's To Your Health, Here's To Your Wealth". The band would later rework this original chorus idea into their 1984 song [...] "Here's To...", which appeared as the B-Side to the hit single [...] "All Join Hands". In a 1976 interview with Capital Radio, Holder cited the song as one of his favourites.

[...] He also seldom invited political figures onto the Tonight Show because he [...] "didn't want it to become a political forum" [...] and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Aboriginal woman Karina Lester and Chief Executive Craig Wilkins of the Conservation Council of South Australia raised {{concerns}} that the submission process was unnecessarily complicated as written submissions were required to be signed by a Justice of the Peace. Lester and Wilkins argued {{that this would be}} particularly difficult for members of regional and remote communities. Lester also pointed out that the language of the Commission's presentations and issues papers made them difficult for aboriginal people to comprehend. Lester drew attention to her father, Yami Lester, who lost his sight after exposure to radioactive fallout from British nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and 1960s. She told the ABC: [...] "My father (lives) 27 kilometres west form Marla Bore, (he) doesn't drive, wouldn't have a JP on hand, and would probably need to travel down to Coober Pedy... but he certainly has a story to tell and certainly <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> input into the Royal Commission."The Royal Commission responded by agreeing to accept oral submissions in addition to formal written submissions.|$|E
2500|$|Midway {{through the}} 1996 NBA Finals, Seattle coach George Karl made the {{decision}} to assign Payton to play defense as a shooting guard instead of his normal point guard assignment in order to defend Jordan. Though the Bulls won the series, Seattle's (and especially Payton's) defense held Jordan and the Bulls to their lowest offensive output in an NBA finals and [...] "frustrated {{the best player in the}} game." [...] In his first three NBA Finals, Jordan averaged 36.3 points per game and had scored at least 30 points in 14 of his 17 games. However, in the 1996 Finals, Jordan averaged 27.3 points per game and scored more than 30 points in only one of the six games. In a game 5 preview after Payton had held Jordan to a career NBA Finals low of 23, an NBA pregame show described the rivalry of two strong defensive players renowned for their competitiveness. [...] " [...] lowest output in a Finals game, much of it with Payton guarding him. Though afterwards, Jordan refused to give Payton credit, saying 'No one can stop me, I can only stop myself. I missed some easy shots.' [...] The truth is, Jordan finds the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year [...] annoying. He views the [...] as impudent, and he <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a big game at [...] expense." [...] (NBA on NBC Preview, Game 5) The Sonics won that game by 21 points and Payton held Jordan to 26 points – Jordan's second-lowest-scoring Finals game in his career up to that point. In game 6, which the Bulls would win to capture the Championship, Payton played 47 minutes and Jordan missed 14 of his 19 shots, getting a career Finals low 22 points. Bill Walton, commentating for NBC at the time, said Payton [...] "outplayed" [...] Jordan during the second half of the series, and that Seattle coach George Karl would [...] "rue" [...] the decision to [...] "hide [...] from 'the king'" [...] in the early games of the series. During this series, Payton and his Sonics also held Jordan's Bulls to the lowest-scoring quarter in their NBA Finals history. Michael Jordan would never score fewer points in an NBA Finals game than his 22 points in game 6, and would never be held under 30 points more than twice in a Finals series, which the Sonics did five times.|$|E
50|$|That Brown {{should be}} {{regarded}} as primarily a kicker was ironic, particularly for the man himself. As a youngster he had always been a runner and even in his latter years <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been seen more as an attacker. Rather than being remembered as a marksman dropkicker Brown got more pleasure from the fact he scored 70-odd tries in his first class career and created many others.|$|R
500|$|Despite the film's darkness, Nolan {{wanted to}} make the film appeal to a wide age range. [...] "Not the {{youngest}} kids obviously, I think what we've done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen a movie like this."
