5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> {{within range}} of a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|E
25|$|Nithlings {{dissolve}} into Nothing when killed. They {{are employed}} by many Denizens and the Morrow Days for menial tasks, especially <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> needed {{to venture into}} the Secondary Realms. Nithling species usually are named; this implies that they are usually made in regular forms.|$|E

25|$|Maqam Mahour, {{which is}} related to Maqam Rast, is applied <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> angry {{and there is a}} feeling of {{emotional}} instability. The only two parashiot to have this maqam applied is Toledot and Balak when the main characters, Esau and Balak respectively, are angered. This maqam is used in other instances according to the manuscripts of Hakham Moshe Ashear and Cantor Gabriel A. Shrem.|$|E
25|$|In {{his spare}} time, Monk {{continues}} {{to search for}} information about his wife's death, and is plagued {{with the idea that}} he may never determine who killed Trudy. He dedicates his life to solving other murders because he feels this is fixing disorder in the world. He becomes especially intrigued when a woman is killed, or <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> killed with some type of bomb, because this reminds him of Trudy's murder.|$|E
25|$|On {{the seventh}} floor {{opposite}} an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy attempting to train trolls for the ballet, the Room of Requirement appears only <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> in need of it. To make it appear, one must walk past its hidden entrance three times while concentrating on what is needed. The room will then appear, outfitted with whatever is required. To the Hogwarts house-elves, it {{is also known as}} the Come and Go Room.|$|E
50|$|At {{one point}} in time, this number routed to 9-1-1 as a misdialed call, but this {{operation}} has long passed from use. It was designed so that <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> in a crisis, {{they would not be}} panicked by having reached the wrong line. However, the reassignment of this code was required due to the scarcity of N11 numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{publication}} shares {{its name}} with the Choctaw {{word for a}} speckled, scissortail species of woodpecker. According to Choctaw legend, the Bishinik {{was one of two}} birds to escape the Great Flood and was known as the [...] "little Chahta news bird". The bird was said to warn Choctaws <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> approaching by tapping out messages on trees.|$|R

25|$|The veneration of nats also shares similar {{practices}} with Buddhism. In Buddhism, offerings are extremely common and expected. Shrines and temples, {{in which these}} offerings are to be made, are seen in both Burmese folk religion and Buddhism. In both the faiths, many different statues of various deities {{can also be seen}} around the house. Burmese folk religion differs dramatically in the concept of a soul. Buddhism does not believe in a soul that leaves after one dies, but rather a consciousness that is transferred to a new person (consciousness is reborn in another). In contrast, Burmese folk religion holds that the soul can leave the body it inhabits. This soul is often depicted {{in the form of a}} butterfly called a leppya. The act of the soul leaving the host often happens in dreams, or <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> sick or dying. If one is awoken in the middle of their dream, it is said that their soul might not be back to them yet. If a host tries to live without its soul it will die. <b>When</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> dying, butterfly hunts are often held to try to recapture the soul that has wondered off.|$|E
25|$|Employees have a {{right under}} s94 of the Act not to be unfairly dismissed. This is {{probably}} the most important right, because it would usually be under an action after dismissal that a former employee would complain that his other rights were breached. Firstly, it is unusual to commence litigation against an employer while still working for them. Secondly, some rights such as the right to reasonable notice before dismissal (s.86) can logically only be breached <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> dismissed.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} Mortal Peril {{is situated}} where the numeral 12 would normally be. Throughout {{the first five}} books the hands change to reflect the varying statuses of the family members, but by the sixth book all nine hands point to mortal peril at all times, except <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> travelling. Mrs. Weasley takes this to mean that with Voldemort's return, everyone is always in mortal peril, but she cannot verify this as {{she does not know}} anyone else who has a clock like hers.|$|E
50|$|Often it's {{people that}} make places and <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> special <b>is</b> not around anymore the place never quite {{seems to be}} the same.|$|R
50|$|Roberts’ {{high school}} {{did not have}} an indoor gym and {{therefore}} had to practice on an outdoor dirt court. Often when the ground was too muddy for dribbling, the players would just pass to each other and shoot <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> open. Roberts, even when guarded closely, started jumping in the air, with ball in hand, and released the ball at the apex of his jump.|$|R
50|$|The policemen in Skövde, or 'the magistrate's henchmen' as {{they were}} known in formal terms of the time, were few in number during {{the first part of}} the 19th century. The city's police force {{consisted}} of one permanent employee. The uniform cap showed his power and authority, while his armament consisted of a truncheon. His task was to carry out the punishment <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> convicted to be flogged.|$|R
25|$|Zinc {{is needed}} to {{maintain}} normal vitamin A levels in blood plasma. It also helps vitamin A become metabolized by the liver. However evidence suggests that <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> deficient in both vitamin A and zinc, memory is more improved when just vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased. Of course memory has the largest improvement when both are increased. When one of these nutrients is not balanced, the other {{is most likely to}} be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning.|$|E
25|$|Many {{factors can}} affect marital and/or {{parenting}} difficulties, {{but there has}} not been any evidence found that can link these issues specifically to ACOAs. Research has been conducted to try to identify issues that arise <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> a COA. It has been hard to isolate these issues solely {{to the fact that the}} child’s parents are alcoholics. Other behaviors need to be studied, like dysfunctional family relationships, childhood abuse and other childhood stressors and how they may contribute to things like depression, anxiety and bad relationships in ACOAs.|$|E
25|$|When {{damage is}} inflicted upon characters, it is deducted from their Hit Points, which are {{calculated}} with the Strength stat (prior to GURPS 4th Edition, Hit Points {{were derived from}} the Health stat). Like most other RPGs, a loss of hit points indicates physical harm being inflicted upon a character, which can potentially lead to death. GURPS calculates shock penalties <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> hit, representing the impact it causes and the rush of pain that interferes with concentration. Different weapons can cause different 'types' of damage, ranging from crushing (a club or mace), impaling (a spear or arrow), cutting (most swords and axes), piercing (bullets), and so on.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very bright}} boy, {{he was reading}} at age three and had read the entire Bible by nine. He {{finished}} school at age sixteen and went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where {{he worked for the}} University Bookstore that served Harvard. By age twenty-nine he owned the store. Known for his memory for quotations and trivia, [...] "Ask John Bartlett" [...] became a byword in the community <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> stumped.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{frequently}} used border guide in Saltdal was probably Peter Båtskar. He lived in a hut in the mountains south of Rognan, subsisted mostly on hunting and fishing, and was viewed as an odd character. He was recommended to fugitives {{that came from the}} prison camps. Among the people in Saltdal it became an adage to say: [...] "Send him to Båtskar!" [...] <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> in a difficult situation.|$|R
5000|$|Spenser was {{referring}} to the Gaelic proverb, applied <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> heavily native in their appearance and actions. Such people were [...] "as Irish as Ó Hanlon's breech." [...] Spenser was not denigrating The Ó Hanlon, as much as he was noting that erstwhile English families such as the Fitzsimons of Cos. Cavan and Down, had 'gone native' over the years. Sir Eochaidh was an archetype of the Gaelic nation.|$|R
25|$|Goal-setting Theory {{has strong}} {{empirical}} support dating back thirty years. However, {{there are some}} boundary conditions that indicate in some situations, goal-setting can be detrimental to performance on certain types of tasks. Goals require a narrowing of one's focus, so for more complex or creative tasks, goals can actually inhibit performance because they demand cognitive resources. Similarly, <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> learning a new task, performance-related goals can distract from the learning process. During the learning process, it may be better to focus on mastering the task than achieving a particular result. Finally, too many goals can become distracting and counterproductive, especially if they conflict with one another.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. People {{who suffer from}} this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> talking to them.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{is often}} used {{as a form of}} {{self-treatment}} of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries {{to make up for lost}} time by producing more glutamine than it needs.|$|E
5000|$|The curry eaten at Retrovision is {{traditionally}} chicken vindaloo, with a milder and/or vegetarian alternative available {{for those who}} prefer it. Due to the events's origins with Jeff Minter, who is famously known for keeping several sheep as pets, consumption of lamb or mutton at a Retrovision is normally taboo; on the one occasion <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> caught doing so, they were punished with the zeroing of their post count on Yak Yak.|$|R
50|$|Once, <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> {{walking along}} the road at night in Kawachi, the ubagabi {{suddenly}} appeared from nowhere and hit this person's face, and when this person looked closely, it took on {{the form of a}} chicken-like bird. It's said that when the ubagabi eventually flew away, it turned back into its original appearance of being a ball of fire. From this, the yōkai manga artist Mizuki Shigeru suggested the possibility that the ubagabi was actually a bird.|$|R
5000|$|American Civil War {{officers}} drummed out {{of service}} might have their heads shaved and their uniforms stripped of insignia and be paraded {{in front of their}} comrades. Fellow officers were forbidden to touch the person being dishonorably discharged, but in more than one case after the war had ended, a drummed-out man was found dead after receiving a beating from his former comrades. [...] <b>When</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> being drummed out, the tune [...] "Rogue's March" [...] would be played.|$|R
25|$|Currently {{the judges}} of Tokelau are the Law Commissioners of each island. These are lay {{officers}} who perform their duties with the village councils {{in the context}} of the village structures and local tradition. In the fulfilment of their roles, Commissioners typically are informed more by custom than legislation, although, the Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules 2003 have, where possible, incorporated these customs. The Commissioners are concerned primarily with criminal offences of a minor nature and, in cooperation with the local police officers, deal with offenders by way of reprimand, sentences of community service or fines. There are no prisons in Tokelau, but <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> sentenced to imprisonment for a minor crime, they are required to help police in their duties.|$|E
25|$|After obtaining scores, {{researchers}} {{are able to}} use the information to determine if there is a difference in the average risk estimate of the individual compared to the average risk estimate of their peers. Generally in negative events, the mean risk of an individual appears lower than the risk estimate of others. This is then used to demonstrate the bias' effect. The optimistic bias can only be defined at a group level, because at an individual level the positive assessment could be true. Likewise, difficulties can arise in measurement procedures, as {{it is difficult to determine}} <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> being optimistic, realistic, or pessimistic. Research suggests that the bias comes from an overestimate of group risks rather than underestimating one's own risk.|$|E
25|$|The danger {{most often}} {{associated}} with suspension bondage, {{over and above the}} usual risks inherent in bondage, is falling; whether due to a weak suspension point, faulty equipment or poor technique. Inverted positions are especially hazardous in this regard since a head-first fall of only a few inches can kill or paralyze a person. Less obvious dangers include nerve compression and resulting damage, circulation problems and fainting, and the recently recognized harness hang syndrome. Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs. Extracting a person safely out of suspension bondage can be difficult if they are unconscious, or if a winch or hoist jams. Suspension tops will often work with spotters who can help get the person down in an emergency.|$|E

2500|$|Unjust {{enrichment}} <b>When</b> <b>someone</b> has <b>been</b> unjustly enriched (or {{there is}} an [...] "absence of basis" [...] for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.|$|R
5000|$|In the Wizards Project, {{previously}} {{called the}} [...] "Diogenes Project", Paul Ekman and Maureen O'Sullivan studied {{the ability of}} people to detect deception. Of {{the thousands of people}} tested, only a select few were able to accurately detect <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> lying. The Wizards Project researchers named these people [...] "Truth Wizards". To date, the Wizards Project has identified just over 50 people with this ability after testing nearly 20,000 people. [...] Truth Wizards use microexpressions, among many other cues, to determine if <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> being truthful. Scientists hope by studying wizards that they can further advance the techniques used to identify deception.|$|R
