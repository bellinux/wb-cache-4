5|$|A second death, {{less than}} a week later, forced {{authorities}} to reconsider the cause of Nickell's death. On June 11, Susan Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules for an early-morning headache. Snow's husband, Paul Webking, took two capsules from the same bottle for his arthritis and left the house for work. At 6:30 am, the Snows' fifteen-year-old daughter found Susan Snow collapsed on the floor of her bathroom, unresponsive and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> pulse. Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center, but she died later that day without regaining consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is high and}} {{triangular}} with a pointed apex, originating forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is relatively large and originates over the anal fin. No ridge runs between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are small and sickle-shaped, with pointed tips. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, each bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. Living finetooth sharks are a distinctive dark bluish-gray above and white below, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> pale stripe on the flanks and no prominent fin markings. Some individuals from Florida have green eyes. Males average 1.6m (5.2ft) in length and females 1.7m (5.4ft); the largest shark on record was 1.9m (6.2ft) long.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
50|$|It forms part of {{a double}} star along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fainter</b> optical {{companion}} designated GammaÂ¹ Sagittarii located about 50 arcminutes north of this star. The latter is a magnitude 4.7 Cepheid variable star that also has the variable star designation W Sagittarii.|$|R

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} {{moderately}} falcate (sickle-shaped), with the origin over the pectoral fin rear tips. It {{is followed by a}} low midline ridge running to the second dorsal fin. The second dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large with pointed tips. The coloration is brownish gray above and white below, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> white stripe on the sides. The edges of the fins are darker but not prominently marked. The Galapagos shark can be distinguished from the dusky shark in having taller first and second dorsal fins and larger teeth, and it can be distinguished from the grey reef shark in having a less robust body and less pointed first dorsal fin tip. However, these characters can be difficult to discern in the field. These similar species also have different numbers of precaudal (before the tail) vertebrae: 58 in the Galapagos shark, 8697 in the dusky shark, 110119 in the grey reef shark.|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E

25|$|Spiders, {{like most}} arthropods, {{have an open}} circulatory system, i.e., {{they do not have}} true blood, or veins to convey it. Rather, their bodies are filled with haemolymph, which is pumped through arteries by a heart into spaces called sinuses {{surrounding}} their internal organs. The haemolymph contains hemocyanin, a respiratory protein similar in function to hemoglobin. Hemocyanin contains two copper atoms, tinting the haemolymph <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> blue color.|$|E
25|$|Tabun or GA is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> fruity odor. It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system.

25|$|The chorus {{itself has}} two parts: {{the first part}} is four lines long and uses the chord {{progression}} of D, E minor, A minor, while the second part is two lines long, but repeated twice, and uses G, D, E minor, C. After the second chorus, the song enters a bridge, consisting of just piano and vocals, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> synthesised accompaniment. Following {{the end of the}} vocal part, the song moves into a break as a bass guitar enters, leading up to a reprise of the guitar solo, accompanied by a choir who repeat the lyrics of the bridge. The song ends with Smith singing {{the second part of the}} chorus, accompanied by the lead guitar, with an abrupt fade out on the final syllable.|$|E
25|$|The two dorsal fins have rounded apexes and {{are similar}} in size; the first {{originates}} over the aft portion of the pelvic fins, and the second over the aft portion of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large and wide. The pelvic and anal fins are short and low, with angular corners. The base of the anal fin measures 1011% of the total length, longer than the distances between either the dorsal fins or the pelvic and anal fins. The caudal peduncle is nearly cylindrical and leads to a low caudal fin with an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The small, overlapping dermal denticles each have a leaf-shaped crown with a median ridge and three teeth on the posterior margin. A crest of enlarged denticles is present along the dorsal caudal fin margin. This species is brownish above and lighter below, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> darker saddle beneath each dorsal fin, and two darker bands on the caudal fin. The interior of the mouth varies from light to dusky.|$|E

500|$|The skin {{is covered}} by rather large dermal denticles, which become more tightly packed and {{overlapping}} with age; each denticle bears three to five horizontal ridges and five posterior teeth. This species is grey above and white below, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> pale band on the flanks. The second dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe darken at the tips, particularly in juveniles. An albino individual was caught off Queensland in 1987, {{which was the first}} known example of albinism in a requiem shark.

The stallion's first crop included Holy Bull Stakes winner Cairo Prince, and Social Inclusion, who finished third in the 2014 Preakness Stakes. American Pharoah's dam, Littleprincessemma, was purchased by Zayat in 2007 for $250,000. She raced but did not win either of her two starts in 2008. American Pharoah was her second foal, following allowance race winner Xixixi. [...] Since his birth, she had produced two more full siblings to American Pharoah: a filly born in 2014, and a colt, foaled in 2015 after she soldâin foal to [...] the Nileâin November 2014 for $2.1 million.|$|E
500|$|The small {{pectoral}} fins are falcate (sickle-shaped) {{with relatively}} pointed tips. The first dorsal fin is broad, forming nearly an equilateral triangle in adults, with a blunt apex; it originates over the pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin {{is small and}} originates over {{the midpoint of the}} anal fin base. There is no ridge between the dorsal fins. The pelvic fins are small with pointed to narrowly rounded tips, and the anal fin has a deep notch in its trailing margin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a strong lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are mostly non-overlapping; each has 3â5 horizontal ridges leading to posterior teeth, with the central one the longest. This shark is plain gray to slate above and whitish below, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> lighter stripe on the flanks. The pectoral, dorsal, and caudal fins may darken toward the tips.
