500|$|The USAF {{summary report}} of the {{accident}} investigation stated that, given {{the position of the}} F-104 relative to the XB-70, Walker, the F-104 pilot {{would not have been able}} to see the XB-70's wing, except by uncomfortably looking back over his left shoulder. The report said that it was likely that Walker maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position. The F-104 was estimated to be [...] to the side of, and [...] below, the fuselage of the XB-70. The report concluded that from that position, without appropriate sight cues, Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie, leading to his aircraft drifting into contact with the XB-70's wing. The accident investigation also pointed to the <b>wake</b> <b>vortex</b> off the XB-70's right wingtip as the reason for the F-104's sudden roll over and into the bomber.|$|E

2500|$|Both the CVR and FDR were {{recovered}} {{and used for}} the investigation. Due to the limited parameters recorded by the FDR, investigators did {{not have access to}} the position of the flight-control surfaces (rudder, ailerons, elevator, etc.) for the accident. However, two parameters recorded by the FDR were crucial, one being the aircraft's heading, the other being the pitch control yoke position. During the approach, Flight 427 encountered wake turbulence from Delta 1083; the FAA, however, determined [...] "the <b>wake</b> <b>vortex</b> encounter alone would not have caused the continued heading change that occurred after 1903:00." [...] The abrupt heading change shortly before the dive pointed investigators immediately to the rudder. Due to the absence of rudder pedal positions from the data, investigators had to determine whether the rudder moved hard-over by a malfunction or by pilot command. This in turn led to the CVR being more heavily scrutinized than most other recordings as statements and breathing from the pilots could potentially tell investigators if they were fighting for control over a rudder malfunction or inadvertently stomped on the wrong rudder pedal in excitement from the wake-turbulence. Boeing felt the latter more likely, while USAir and the Pilot's Union felt the former was more likely.|$|E

40|$|The fluid {{dynamics}} of insect wings and the fins and tails of fish {{are governed by}} <b>vortex</b> <b>wake</b> interactions, which are strongly related to the wing, fins and tail kinematics. By modeling the kinematics of these wings, fins and tails as a two-dimensionally flapping foil, {{the influence of the}} kinematics on the <b>vortex</b> <b>wake</b> interactions is studied.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} level of {{uncertainty}} associated with current rotor aerodynamics codes, improved understanding of rotor aerodynamics is required. Wind tunnel measurements on model rotors contribute to advancing our knowledge on rotor aerodynamics. The combined recording of blade loads and rotor wake is desired, because of the coupled blade and wake aerodynamics. In general, however, {{the small size of}} model rotors prohibits detailed blade load measurements; only the rotor wake is recorded. To estimate the experimental blade flow conditions, a measurement analysis tool is developed: the inverse <b>vortex</b> <b>wake</b> model. The rotor wake is approximated by a lifting line model, using rotor wake measurements to reconstruct the <b>vortex</b> <b>wake.</b> Conservation of circulation, combined with the Biot-Savart law, allows the induced velocity to be expressed in terms of the bound circulation. The unknown bound circulation can be solved for, since the velocity is known from rotor wake measurements. The inverse <b>vortex</b> <b>wake</b> model is subsequently applied to measurements on the near wake of a model rotor subject to both axial and yawed flow conditions, performed at a TUDelft open jet wind tunnel. The inverse <b>vortex</b> <b>wake</b> model estimates the unsteady experimental blade flow conditions and loads that otherwise would have remained obscured. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|R
