His relationship with the peasant representative to the ad hoc Divan, Ion Roată, is briefly mentioned in an anecdote authored by Ion Creangă (Moș Ion Roată). He is also {{the subject of a}} short writing by Ion Luca Caragiale (first published by Vatra in 1894). Symbolist poet Dimitrie Anghel, whose father, the National Liberal parliamentarian Dimitrie A.

5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already <b>well</b> <b>acquainted</b> with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E

Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people <b>well</b> <b>acquainted</b> with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E

Noo, I'm fra the North, and I'm not {{the like}} to fling money awa' rashly, but I'd gie six months' pay--one hunder an' twenty pounds--to know who flooded the engine-room of the Grotkau. I'm fairly <b>well</b> <b>acquaint</b> wi' McRimmon's eediosyncrasies, and he'd no hand in it. It was not Calder, for I've asked him, an' {{he wanted to}} fight me. It {{would be in the}} highest degree unprofessional o' Calder--not fightin', but openin' bilge-cocks--but for a while I thought it was him. Ay, I judged it might be him--under temptation." ...|$|R

He {{was defeated in}} the subsequent battle, but {{was able to find}} refuge in the fortress with most of his men. The Muslims now became so confident of victory that they struck their first coins on the island, in the name of Ziyadat Allah and Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari, who however died a short while after and was replaced by Zubayr ibn Gawth. Shortly after that, Theodotus managed to reverse the situation: he led a sally that routed a Muslim raiding party and then defeated the main Muslim army on the next day, killing 1,000 men and pursuing the rest up to the Muslims' fortified encampment, which he placed under siege. The Muslims tried to break out in a night sortie, but Theodotus was expecting such a move and routed them in an ambush.|$|E

60|$|I {{was not at}} {{the time}} <b>well</b> enough <b>acquainted</b> with Caspakian ways to know that truthfulness and loyalty are two of the strongest {{characteristics}} of these primitive people.
