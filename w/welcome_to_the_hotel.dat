5000|$|The [...] "Great Sign" [...] was the {{roadside}} sign used by Holiday Inn during its original era of expansion from <b>the</b> 1950s <b>to</b> 1970s. It {{was perhaps the}} company's most successful form of advertising. It was extremely large and eye-catching, but was expensive to construct and operate. The manufacturer of the sign was Balton & Sons Sign Company, and it was originally designed by sketch artists Gene Barber and Roland Alexander. Wilson wanted a sign that no road traveler could miss, desiring that it be at least 50 feet (15 m) high and visible in both directions. He also wanted a marquee so that the inn could <b>welcome</b> different groups <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel.</b> <b>The</b> original sign cost $13,000. [...] It is said that the sign's colors were selected because they were favorites of Wilson's mother. The popularity of <b>the</b> sign led <b>to</b> many imitations, some of which remain to this day.|$|R
5000|$|Rock Island was {{in need of}} {{a modern}} hotel downtown. To that end over $450,000 was raised in local stock {{purchases}} in a week. [...] The total cost of constructing <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> in 1925-1926 was $800,000. Jacob Hoffman was <b>the</b> <b>hotel’s</b> first General Manager. <b>The</b> <b>hotel</b> became <b>the</b> center of business and social functions for the city. However, not all were <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> stay in <b>the</b> <b>hotel.</b> Jazz clubs along Second Avenue regularly featured African-American entertainers such Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. [...] They had to stay at boarding houses across the Mississippi River in Davenport, Iowa because <b>the</b> area <b>hotels</b> would not serve them. Nat King Cole was refused a room at the Fort Armstrong on one of his visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Quad Cities. [...] The public spaces in <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> were renovated in the 1980s and <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> was converted into an apartment building for senior citizens. Green space for the residents was created after the adjacent commercial buildings were torn down.|$|R

Spears briefly appeared in the screens, as her dancers descended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage. She entered standing {{on top of a}} small bus dressed in a black catsuit, where she performed [...] "Toxic". She descended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage for the breakdown and then performed [...] "Overprotected". She took a break <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience, before going into [...] "Boys", which featured the male dancers pushing her while she was standing in luggage carts. [...] "Showdown" [...] featured rainbow-colored lighting effects and was the last song of the first act. A video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club. While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> [...] "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a frilly pink corset to perform [...] "...Baby One More Time". She performed [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] with a vintage microphone and joined by her background singers. Spears and her dancers performed [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", which contained elements of Latin percussion. After this, she talked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience and usually referenced her wedding with childhood friend Jason Alexander. She also introduced her band before leaving the stage.|$|R
