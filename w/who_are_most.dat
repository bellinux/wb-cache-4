UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. According to an analysis by the New York Times, men ages 20–29, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> likely to be militants, are most overrepresented in the death toll.|$|E

5|$|Slavonia {{significantly}} {{contributed to}} the culture of Croatia as a whole, both through works of artists and through patrons of the arts—most notable among them being Josip Juraj Strossmayer. Strossmayer was instrumental in the establishment of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, later renamed the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the reestablishment of the University of Zagreb. A number of Slavonia's artists, especially writers, made considerable contributions to Croatian culture. Nineteenth-century writers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> significant in Croatian literature include Josip Eugen Tomić, Josip Kozarac, and Miroslav Kraljević—author of the first Croatian novel. Significant twentieth-century poets and writers in Slavonia were Dobriša Cesarić, Dragutin Tadijanović, Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić and Antun Gustav Matoš. Painters associated with Slavonia, who contributed greatly to Croatian art, were Miroslav Kraljević and Bela Čikoš Sesija.|$|E

25|$|Naturally, in a polygynic {{society of}} swarm-founding {{individuals}} {{with so many}} queens, kin selection becomes a challenge. With so many queens, {{it is expected to}} have a lower relatedness between workers and the larvae for which they care.

Women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> {{dependent on the}} spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior.|$|E

25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{may also}} perpetuate existing inequalities. A worker’s social class predicts {{the work that}} he or she will qualify for, and those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> successful in their home country are most able to continue to be successful by improving the economic and social situation of their household. The optimistic “win-win-win” discourse can often overlook the many costs involved in circular migration, as well as the difficulty that exists in implementing policies specifically for circular migration.|$|E
25|$|Family {{members with}} legal status {{are more likely}} to have access to jobs with higher pay and benefits. Second {{generation}} immigrants in the United States, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> likely full citizens, tend to have higher earnings and are less likely to be in poverty than first generation immigrants, some of whom lack formal legal status. Thus, the unequal access to employment opportunities can generate inequality among family members of different legal statuses.|$|E

In 2013, day-time drivers would pay upwards of HK$380 for each shift, and night shift drivers would pay HK$350. Owners would dispute with drivers' groups as they seek to increase the daily rental charge each time taxi fares increased.|$|E
25|$|During Shakespeare's lifetime, {{many of his}} {{greatest}} plays were staged at the Globe Theatre and the Blackfriars Theatre. Shakespeare's fellow members of the Lord Chamberlain's Men acted in his plays. Among these actors were Richard Burbage (who played the title role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including Hamlet, Othello, Richard III and King Lear), Richard Cowley (who played Verges in Much Ado About Nothing), William Kempe, (who played Peter in Romeo and Juliet and, possibly, Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream) and Henry Condell and John Heminges, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> famous now for collecting and editing the plays of Shakespeare's First Folio (1623).|$|E
25|$|The {{subclass}} Apterygota (wingless insects) is {{now considered}} artificial as the silverfish (order Thysanura) are {{more closely related to}} Pterygota (winged insects) than to bristletails (order Archaeognatha). For instance, just like flying insects, Thysanura have so-called dicondylic mandibles, while Archaeognatha have monocondylic mandibles. The reason for their resemblance is not due to a particularly close relationship, but rather because they both have kept a primitive and original anatomy in a much higher degree than the winged insects. The most primitive order of flying insects, the mayflies (Ephemeroptera), are also those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> morphologically and physiologically similar to these wingless insects. Some mayfly nymphs resemble aquatic thysanurans.|$|E
