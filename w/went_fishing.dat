5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he <b>went</b> <b>fishing</b> and a whale came and killed him.|$|E

500|$|While on {{a hunting}} trip on Loyalsock Creek {{north of the}} park in 1850, {{brothers}} Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having {{to spend the night}} on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought , including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as [...] "Ricketts Folly" [...] for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who <b>went</b> <b>fishing</b> and wandered down Kitchen Creek.|$|E

In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. By 1874 Ricketts had renamed Long Pond as Highland Lake, and by 1875 had named the highest waterfall on Kitchen Creek as Ganoga Falls. In 1881, Ricketts renamed Highland Lake as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew suggested the name Ganoga, an Iroquoian word which he said meant [...] "water on the mountain" [...] in the Seneca language. Donehoo's A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in [...] Pennsylvania identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning [...] "place of floating oil" [...] and the name of a Cayuga village in New York.

500|$|Mau {{was born}} Pius Piailug in 1932, {{in the village}} of Weiso, on the small coral island of Satawal, in Yap State of the Caroline Islands, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. Satawal is a wooded island with an area of , located in the western Pacific Ocean about [...] south of Guam. Mau's {{personal}} connection to the sea began early in his life, when he was placed in tide pools in his infancy so he could feel the pull of the ocean. At the age of four or five, Mau was chosen by his grandfather Raangipi to study as an apprentice navigator. Mau initially protested his grandfather's teaching, preferring to spend his time playing on the beach with children his own age. [...] Raangipi trained Mau as a young navigator for many years. Their day would begin at sunrise, when they would eat breakfast together and afterwards, take care of chores before they <b>went</b> <b>fishing.</b> During the evening, Mau would join the men in the canoe house as they drank, listening to their stories about navigation and sailing. Raangipi told the young boy that if he chose to become a navigator, Mau could gain respect from his community, eat well, and maintain a position in Satawalese society higher than that of a chief. Encouraged, Mau learned basic navigational clues regarding the [...] "stars, swells, and birds" [...] from Raangipi, but his grandfather died sometime before Mau was fourteen.|$|E

2500|$|Arriving {{with the}} fleet in January 1788, Clark filled {{a number of}} roles in the colony, from {{guarding}} convicts to occasionally serving on the Criminal Court, which he heavily disliked. When not on duty, he <b>went</b> <b>fishing</b> and shooting, collecting a number of specimens which he sent back to England. To supplement their meagre rations, officers were allowed to keep vegetable gardens, which were tended by convicts. Clark established one such garden on a small island in Port Jackson, which would subsequently be known as Clark Island. To provide some entertainment for the colony, Clark {{was asked by the}} governor, Arthur Phillip, to stage a play using convict actors, with The Recruiting Officer chosen as the play to be performed. He and the convicts' experiences were later the subject of a novel, The Playmaker, by Thomas Keneally, and a play, Our Country's Good, by Timberlake Wertenbaker. Clark was also quite friendly with local Aboriginal tribes (specifically the Eora), particularly compared to some of his companions. At one point, in February 1790, he was asked by the governor to [...] "capture" [...] two Aboriginal tribesmen who he had traded with earlier, but refused for fear their children would starve.|$|E

He spent the early years of his life with his extended family under a matriarch, his grandmother. On SmÃ©agol's birthday, he and his relative DÃ©agol <b>went</b> <b>fishing</b> in the Gladden Fields north of LothlÃ³rien. There, DÃ©agol found the Ring in the riverbed after being pulled into the water by a fish. SmÃ©agol fell immediately under the Ring's influence and demanded it as a birthday present; when DÃ©agol refused, SmÃ©agol strangled him. SmÃ©agol later used the Ring for thieving, spying and antagonizing his friends and relatives, who nicknamed him [...] "Gollum" [...] for the swallowing noise he made in his throat, until his grandmother expelled him from the family. He wandered in the wilderness for a few years until he finally retreated to a deep cavern in the Misty Mountains. The Ring's malignant influence twisted his body and mind, and prolonged his life well beyond its natural limits.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{this fight}} at the [...] "Red Idol Gorge", as the British later called it, the British {{military}} pressed on to Gyantse, reaching it on 11 April. The town's gates were opened before Macdonald's forces, the garrison having already departed. Francis Younghusband {{wrote to his}} father; [...] "As I have always said, the Tibetans are nothing but sheep." [...] The townspeople continued with their business and the Westerners {{took a look at}} the monastic complex, the Palkor Chode. The central feature was the Temple of One Hundred Thousand Deities, a nine-storey stupa, modelled on the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya, the spot where Gautama Buddha first achieved enlightenment. Statuettes and scrolls were shared out between officers. Younghusband's Mission Staff and Escort were billeted in the country mansion and farmyard of a Tibetan noble family named Changlo, and 'Changlo Manor' became the Mission Headquarters where Younghusband could hold his durbars and meet representatives of the Dalai Lama. In the words of historian Charles Allen, they now entered 'a halcyon period', even planting a vegetable garden at the Manor while officers explored the town unescorted, or <b>went</b> <b>fishing</b> and shooting. The Commission's medical officer, the philanthropic Captain Herbert Walton, attended {{to the needs of the}} local populace, notably performing operations to correct cleft palates, a particularly common affliction in Tibet. Five days after he arrived at Gyantse, and deeming the defences of Changlo Manor secure, Macdonald ordered the main force to begin the march back to New Chumbi to protect the supply line.|$|E
