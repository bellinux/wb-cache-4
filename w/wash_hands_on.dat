40|$|Abstract Background Aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the regular use of a <b>hand</b> cream after <b>washing</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> skin hydration and skin roughness. Methods Twenty-five subjects <b>washed</b> <b>hands</b> and forearms with a neutral soap four times per day, for 2 minutes each time, for a total of two weeks. One part of them used a hand cream after each <b>hand</b> <b>wash,</b> the others did not (cross over design after a wash out period of two weeks). Skin roughness and skin hydration were determined on the forearms on days 2, 7, 9 and 14. For skin roughness, twelve silicon imprint per subject and time point were taken from the stratum corneum and assessed with a 3 D skin analyzer for depth of the skin relief. For skin hydration, five measurements per subject and time point were taken with a corneometer. Results <b>Washing</b> <b>hands</b> lead to a gradual increase of skin roughness from 100 (baseline) to a maximum of 108. 5 after 9 days. Use of a hand cream after each <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> entailed a decrease of skin roughness which the lowest means after 2 (94. 5) and 14 days (94. 8). Skin hydration was gradually decreased after <b>washing</b> <b>hands</b> from 79 (baseline) to 65. 5 after 14 days. The <b>hand</b> <b>wash,</b> followed by use of a hand cream, still decreased skin hydration after 2 days (76. 1). Over the next 12 days, however, skin hydration did not change significantly (75. 6 after 14 days). Conclusion Repetitive and frequent <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> increases skin dryness and roughness. Use of a hand cream immediately after each <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> can confine both skin dryness and skin roughness. Regular use of skin care preparations should therefore help to prevent both dry and rough skin among healthcare workers in clinical practice. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bangladeshi {{communities}} have historically used ash and soil as handwashing agents. A structured obser-vation study and qualitative interviews {{on the use}} of ash/soil and soap as handwashing agents were conducted in rural Bangladesh to help develop a handwashing promotion intervention. The observations were conducted among 1, 000 randomly selected households from 36 districts. Fieldworkers observed people using ash/soil to <b>wash</b> their <b>hand(s)</b> <b>on</b> 13 % of occasions after defecation and on 10 % after cleaning a child’s anus. This compares with 19 % of people who used soap after defecation and 27 % after cleaning a child who defecated. Using ash/soil or soap was rarely (< 1 %) observed at other times recommended for handwashing. The qualitative study enrolled 24 house-holds from three observation villages, where high usage of ash/soil for handwashing was detected. Most informants reported that ash/soil was used only for handwashing after fecal contact, and that ash/soil could clean hands as effectively as soap...|$|R
40|$|Fifty volunteers {{randomly}} assigned to one of five <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> agents (10 subjects per agent) [...] a nonantiseptic liquid soap (control), an antiseptic hand rinse containing 60 % isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with emollients (Alc A), an antiseptic hand rinse containing 70 % IPA and 0. 5 % chlorhexidine gluconate with emollients (Alc B), an antiseptic containing 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate and 4 % IPA (CHG), and 70 % IPA [...] <b>washed</b> their <b>hands</b> 15 times per day for 5 days under supervision by using a standardized technique and measured amounts of test agent. Microbiologic samples of hand flora were obtained at base line and after <b>hand</b> <b>washes</b> 1 and 15 on test days 1 and 5. After the initial <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> there were significant reductions over base line in aerobic and anaerobic log CFU among those using Alc A, CHG, and IPA. By the end of the first day of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> (15 washes), there were 2 -log or greater reductions in aerobic counts among subjects using all antiseptics, but no significant reductions in controls. By the end of day 5, all agents produced significant reductions in aerobic (P = 0. 0002) and anaerobic (P = 0. 002) counts over control soap.

40|$|In Victoria, <b>hands</b> free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins in food {{preparation}} areas were a regulatory requirement introduced under the 1984 Health (Eating House and Food Premises) Regulations.

The aim of the pilot study was to investigate the hypothesis that there is no difference between the effectiveness of <b>hands</b> free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins and manual tap operated basins in reducing microbial flora <b>on</b> <b>hands.</b> Thirteen premises with manual hand basins and a comparison random sample of 19 premises with hands free basins were selected from the City of Yarra in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection involved an Environmental Health Officer visiting the premises, conducting a survey and swabbing the food handler’s hands prior to and post washing. The impact of variables, including the temperature of water supplied to the <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin, number of food handling employees, types of food handled, time the sample was taken and approximate number of meals sold per hour, were also investigated. The results indicated that the mean percentage {{reduction in the number of}} colonies compared for the manual and hands free hand basins showed no significant difference (Manual mean = 58 %, Hands free mean = 79 %, p = 0. 163). Overall, there was large variability in pre and post microbial counts for both basins and considerable variability in the temperature of water to <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins. No clear association, however, was found between the number of employees, temperature of <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin, meals served or use of either facility, with the percentage reduction in the microbial load.

Because <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> with soap can prevent the transmission of a variety of pathogens, it may be more effective than any single vaccine or hygiene behaviour.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> regimes <b>on</b> lipid {{transference}} to contact lenses. The presence of lipids on contact lenses can affect visual acuity and enhance spoilation. Additionally, they may even mediate and foster microbial transfer and serve as a marker of potential dermal contamination. Methods and materials: A social <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> were investigated. A 'no-wash regime' was used as control. The transfer of lipids from the hand was assessed by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Lipid transference to the contact lenses was studied through fluorescence spectroscopy (FS). Results: Iodine staining, for presence of lipids, on TLC plates indicated the 'no-wash regime' score averaged at 3. 4 ± 0. 8, the social wash averaged at 2. 2 ± 0. 9 and the RCN averaged at 1. 2 ± 0. 3 on a scale of 1 - 4. The FS of lipids on contact lenses for 'no washing' presented an average of 28. 47 ± 10. 54 fluorescence units (FU), the social wash presented an average of 13. 52 ± 11. 12. FU and the RCN wash presented a much lower average 6. 47 ± 4. 26. FU. Conclusions: This work demonstrates how the method used for <b>washing</b> the <b>hands</b> can affect the concentration of lipids, and the transfer of these lipids onto contact lenses.
