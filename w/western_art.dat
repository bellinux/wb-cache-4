5|$|Even {{though his}} {{military}} career begun {{almost as an}} afterthought, or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered {{as one of the}} most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his forces, and the new <b>Western</b> <b>art</b> of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy shown him to be a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove him to be an equally able leader in the open field.|$|E
5|$|German {{painters}} {{have influenced}} <b>western</b> <b>art.</b> Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German {{artists of the}} Renaissance, Peter Paul Rubens and Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Such German sculptors as Otto Schmidt-Hofer, Franz Iffland, and Julius Schmidt-Felling made important contributions to German art history in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E

5|$|The Platonic solids {{and other}} polyhedra are a {{recurring}} theme in <b>Western</b> <b>art.</b> They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the small stellated dodecahedron, attributed to Paolo Uccello, in {{the floor of the}} San Marco Basilica in Venice; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book The Divine Proportion; as a glass rhombicuboctahedron in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in Albrecht Dürer's engraving Melencolia I; and in Salvador Dalí's painting The Last Supper in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.|$|E
5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the shackles worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The painting was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} truly great depictions in <b>Western</b> <b>art</b> of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using <b>western</b> <b>art</b> materials, {{assisted}} by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after {{the introduction of a}} government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of the}} Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in <b>Western</b> <b>art.</b> The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{long history}} of {{painting}} candlelit scenes in <b>Western</b> <b>art,</b> although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.|$|E

40|$|Since China and Japan {{once belonged}} to the same Catholic {{province}} of Far East, the two countries encountered with Western engravings brought by Catholic mssionaries around the middle of l 6 th century. From 1579 onwards, missionaries set up their educational institutes called Seminario and Collegio to offer the courses of <b>Western</b> plastic <b>arts</b> in Japan. Not long after that, Chinese students of Macau native went to Japan to study Western oil painting at this kind of schools. In 1607, an ltalian Jesuit named Matteo Ricci introduced the method of perspective into China by helping with translating the Euclidis Elementorun Libri XV into Chinese; and over a centuly later, Okumura Masanobu employed perspective in his creation of U-kiyoe. ln 1731, Chinese artist Shen Nanping（沈南蘋）sojourned in Japan for two years; trained many Japanese students and fostered an artistic school.
