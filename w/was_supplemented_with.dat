5|$|The first ski jump in Courchevel {{was built}} on the {{location}} of the large hill in 1944. It was followed by a second in 1955, located in Courchevel 1850. The hills were used to incorporate ski jumping into the Alpine skiing training programs. In 1970, a larger 50-metre hill was built in Courchevel 1850. It <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> a small 25-metre hill in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} in the Parliament of Norway in 1899, it was {{proposed}} that construction be delayed until the Drammen Line was upgraded to standard gauge, but this was rejected by the majority. The plans to build the line were passed on 18 May 1899 and parliament gave a grant of NOK350,800. In 1903, this <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> NOK22,500. Construction started in late 1901 and was led by Engineer E. Richter. No blasting was done, but difficulties arose because of the large amounts of clay, which contributed to increase costs to NOK800,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Innherred was largely without much debate, as the line {{naturally}} {{went through all}} the towns {{and most of the}} important villages. Sunnan was a natural place to halt construction, as it is located {{at the foot of the}} lake of Snåsavatnet, allowing connection with steam ships. Scheduled services on Snåsavatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons, now {{referred to}} as OD, was a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. It was amateurish in production and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold {{in the first year}} followed by 3,000 in 1975, and much more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> several official additions, such as the original Greyhawk and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975), as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many fanzines.|$|E
5|$|LSK started {{purchasing}} {{land for}} their own stadium in 1947, having previously played at Lillestrøm Stadion. Construction started in 1950 and Åråsen opened on 7 July 1951, having cost 150,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). The grandstand <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> a second stand in 1960. On 7 April 1967, the stadium burned down, but was rebuilt by September 1968. Another stand opened {{on the east side}} in 1974, the same year as LSK was promoted to the 1. divisjon, then the highest division of Norwegian football. The East Stand was moved to the north side and a new 3,700-seat stand built on the east side in 1978, which remains today. Between 1999 and 2002, the other three sides were redeveloped, costing NOK240 million. This included luxury boxes, a new pitch with under-soil heating, three grandstands, and adjacent commercial and residential property.|$|E
5|$|NSB Gjøvikbanen {{operates}} nine Class 69g three-car electric multiple unit. They {{were originally}} built by Strømmens Værksted in 1983 and 1984, and delivered {{as part of}} the D-series to NSB. They have since been operating as commuter trains. Prior to the PSO process, the trains were rebuilt by Danske Statsbaner in Denmark, and were completely renovated and refurbished, {{at the expense of the}} Ministry of Transport. The refurbishments included a new color design, where the deep red exterior <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> details in silver and orange. The interior was also replaced, and consists of a silver scheme. Part of the end cars were converted into quiet zones, while another section is a comfort zone (first class), which has a NOK 90 price supplement. Beverages are available from vending machines. The trains were also fitted with two wheelchair lifts and a wheelchair accessible toilet.|$|E
30|$|For actinobacteria enumeration, {{the media}} <b>were</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> 40  µg/ml of actidione to inhibit the {{development}} of fungi (Olson 1968) and 10  µg/ml of nalidixic acid to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria capable of swarming without affecting the growth of actinobacteria (Bulina et al. 1997; Barakate et al. 2002). For fungus evaluation, the media <b>were</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> 5  µg/ml of chloramphenicol to inhibit {{the development of}} bacteria. For other microorganisms, the media <b>were</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> 40  µg/ml of actidione to inhibit the development of fungi. After 7  days of incubation, the actinobacteria were recognized {{on the basis of}} morphological and microscopic features following directions given by International Streptomyces Project (ISP) (Shirling and Gottlieb 1966).|$|R

5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{returned to}} Norway on 1 July 1955, {{where it was}} numbered 602 and put into service on the Nordland Line. The trials were successful, with much higher regularity than the steam locomotives. The Di 3 was used eight days in a row, and then spent a single day in the depot. NSB {{signed an agreement with}} NOHAB for delivery of five further locomotives. This caused a public debate, because the domestic supplier Thune had offered to build a similar locomotive in cooperation with American Locomotive Company. The first delivery was made on 25 April 1957, and the order completed by July. In March 1957 NSB received permission to buy another eight locomotives. Delivery started in October and was completed on 1 June 1958. The order <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> another six trains, with delivery in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of continental Europe and the Scandinavian North Sea coastline now meant tracking U-boats and enemy warships making for the Atlantic was now more difficult with the thin resource pool available. Assets were needed for reconnaissance, air support for Sunderlands {{operating in the}} Atlantic approaches, and anti-invasion patrol. However, any shipping of mainland Europe {{was likely to be}} hostile, which presented plenty of targets. No. 18 Group RAF continued offensive operations further north against German shipping near Norway. Its first success being the 'torching' of a German freighter near Kristiansund on 22 June by a No. 220 Squadron crew. Priority was anti-invasion operations. With the Battle of Britain underway, the Command was ordered to disrupt German preparations for Operation Sea Lion. In this respect, former RAF-Army co-operation squadrons, No. 53 and 59, were handed to Coastal Command in July 1940 for these tasks. No. 254 Squadron <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> No. 21 and 57 Squadron, Bomber Command, in attacking shipping off the Norwegian coast, as result of alerts that suggested a German amphibious assault from there.|$|E

5|$|Braathens SAFE {{started as}} a charter airline, flying {{predominantly}} to the Far East and South America. In 1949, the airline was granted a concession on the Far East route that was flown until 1954, using Douglas DC-4s. The main airport in Norway was Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and the main technical base was at Stavanger Airport, Sola. From 1952 to 1960, the airline cooperated on flights to Reykjavík with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir. Braathens SAFE started domestic services in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo via Tønsberg to Stavanger. Services from Oslo to Trondheim were introduced in 1953. This <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> stops in Farsund and Kristiansand in 1955, and Hamar, Røros and Notodden the following year. However, with the delivery of the Fokker F-27s, many of the smaller airports were cut from the service. The airline started flying from Oslo to Ålesund and along the West Coast in 1958. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to Sandefjord and Aalborg, Denmark. Services to Bodø and Tromsø started in 1967, and Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s were taken into use two years later. Kristiansund was added as a destination in 1970 and Molde two years later. The F-28s were retired in 1986, while services to Longyearbyen started the following year.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus was {{converted}} to the prototype fighter catapult ship in November 1940, carrying three Fairey Fulmar fighters from 807 Squadron between 1 December and 10 February 1941, which {{were replaced by}} aircraft from 804 Squadron between 10 February and 23 July. These fighters were supposed to defend convoys against attacks from Focke-Wulf Fw 200 maritime patrol bombers and {{to prevent them from}} radioing location reports to U-boats. If out of range of land, the fighters would have to ditch at sea and hope to be recovered by a ship from their convoy. The ship escorted nine convoys between December 1940 and July 1941. At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament <b>was</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b> a pair of Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns mounted in the bow, the ship's bridge was enlarged and the mast was replaced with a tripod mast bearing a Type 291 air warning radar. The ship then became a seaplane training ship again, hosting 763 Squadron aboard from 20 April 1942 to 13 February 1944. Pegasus then became a barracks ship until May 1946 and was then listed for disposal in June.|$|E
