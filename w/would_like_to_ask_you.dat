2500|$|Channel 4 {{television}} in the UK present an annual Christmas message {{as an alternative to}} the Christmas Message of Queen Elizabeth II. In 2015 their speaker was Abdullah Kurdi, who said: [...] "If a person shuts a door in someone's face, this is very difficult. When a door is opened they no longer feel humiliated. At this time of year I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> all to think about the pain of fathers, mothers and children who are seeking peace and security. We ask just for a little bit of sympathy from you. Hopefully next year the war will end in Syria and peace will reign all over the world." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Anything {{more that}} you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> Mr. Holmes?" [...] said Lestrade, whose eyebrows {{had gone up}} once or twice during this {{remarkable}} explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a {{question}}," [...] {{said the}} king {{to the rich}} man; [...] "and the question is this: Why are some folk rich and some folk poor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a few questions," [...] he said. [...] "General Lodge here {{informed}} me that you saved my--my daughter's life long ago.... Can {{you tell me what}} became of her mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing at all," [...] I answered. [...] "It is lost like {{a drop in}} the ocean. I hate, my dear, to {{interfere}} in any way with such a splendid calculation as that, but I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one question." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Pardon me, madame, for recalling {{unpleasant}} memories, but I have {{a little}} idea"--Poirot's [...] "little ideas" [...] were becoming a perfect byword--"and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> one or two questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite understand. It {{is a very}} {{difficult}} situation for you, Mr. Cavendish. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one question. Mr. Inglethorp's reason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had forgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Cicely, {{looking at}} the paper; [...] "now that {{you tell me what}} it is, it is as plain as can be. I will write it in the blank space that I have left, and here are some more words that I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Dennison," [...] I began, as {{carelessly}} as I {{could manage}} it; [...] "speaking of decapitation {{reminds me of}} something I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> I have intended asking it several times, but it has always slipped my memory. Of course you will pardon me {{if it is not}} a fair question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am at ease again. Is there {{anything}} more that you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me?" [...] she said, with {{the matter of}} a queen rather than of a mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mr. Parker about this," [...] {{he said to}} his folks, but Mr. Upton {{shook his}} head. He was a very retired man and never brought his affairs to the ears of any outsider.|$|R
60|$|This was {{a command}} which Nathan could not well disobey; {{but he looked}} toward Isaac while the latter was hurried away by Corporal 'Lige, {{as if there were}} yet other {{questions}} concerning this project which he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] he answered, {{looking into}} her face, [...] "there {{is a great}} gulf between us, a gulf, perhaps, of more than years. Miss Lois, I {{am not going to}} ask you too much, but I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one thing. Have these days meant just a little to you also?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The news of Minty's {{success was}} further corroborated by Sir Robert, who {{later that evening}} called Bradley into the study. [...] "Frank has been writing from Nice that he has renewed his {{acquaintance}} with some old Californian friends of yours--a Mr. and Miss Sharpe. Lady Canterbridge says that they are well known in London {{to some of our}} friends, but I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something about them. Lady Mainwaring was on the point of inviting them here when I received a letter from Mr. Sharpe asking for a BUSINESS interview. Pray who is this Sharpe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this moment}} Morton became seized {{of the most}} vivid {{realization}} of the physical characteristics of the man back of the voice. In some mysterious way, through some hitherto unknown sense, {{he was aware of}} a long, rugged face, with bleak and knobby brow. The lips were thin, the mouth wide, the dark-gray eyes contemptuous. [...] "It is all an inner delusion caused by some resemblance of this voice to that of some one I have known," [...] he said to himself; but a shiver ran over him as he questioned the old man. [...] "If you are the grandfather of the psychic," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you think it fair to a young girl to use her against her will for such foolery as this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} you will earn your ten {{thousand}} francs, my friend," [...] said the odious Arthur drily, [...] "and {{my sister and}} M. de Marsan will still be your debtors. Are there any questions you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> before we go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Brown, reflectively, [...] "there is {{something}} I could suggest, but I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> another question." [...] He stopped a moment, and tapped {{the palm of}} one hand with his glasses. [...] "Why did {{you go out to}} Africa?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably," [...] said Brown, with a {{trace of}} dryness. [...] "That is, I might get more for it, but I have no {{intention}} of offering it <b>to</b> everybody. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your careful attention for a minute or two, Mr. Austin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wayne's varsity {{players of}} last year have been barred by the directors. They made their choice, and so should abide by it. They have had their day, and so should welcome the {{opportunity}} of younger players. But I am constrained to acknowledge that neither they nor the great body of undergraduates welcomed the change. This, more than anything, proves to me the evil of championship teams. The football men, the baseball men, the crew men, and all the student supporters want to win all the games all the time. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> young gentlemen if {{you can take a}} beating? If you cannot, I would like to add that you are not yet fitted to go out into life. A good beating, occasionally, is a wholesome thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a pity she was out," [...] said Miss Panney, carelessly, [...] "and {{now that}} you have {{mentioned}} Miss Bannister, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something; why does not your sister return her visits? I saw Dora not very long ago, and found that her feelings had been a little hurt--not much, perhaps, but a little--by Miriam's apparent indifference to her. Dora is a very sensitive girl, and is slow to make friends among other girls. I never knew any friendship so quick and lively as that she showed for Miriam. You know that Dora is still young; it has not been long since she left school; there is not a girl in Thorbury that she cares anything about, and her life at home must necessarily be a lonely one. Her brother is busy, even in the evenings, and Mrs. Bannister is no companion for a lively young girl." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'My dear fellow,' said Eugene, as he lighted another cigar, 'I fear my {{unexpected}} visitors {{have been}} troublesome. If as a set-off (excuse the legal phrase from a barrister-at-law) you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Tippins <b>to</b> tea, I pledge myself {{to make love}} to her.' ...|$|R
50|$|There isn't {{anyone in}} Chile that doesn't {{want to improve}} the quality and equity of {{education}} here. One <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the student leaders, who have proven very competent, that they have a little patience, so that issue may be worked through in the parliament.|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{your advice}} about one thing, sir," [...] said Thursday Smith to Mr. Merrick, {{a little later}} that same evening. [...] "Would it be legal for me to marry {{under the name of}} Thursday Smith, or must I use my real name--Harold Melville?" ...|$|R
5000|$|At one point, the {{official}} Huangfu Gongyi (皇甫公義) became {{the secretary general}} for Emperor Gaozong's son Li Xian the Prince of Pei, and he invited Wei to serve as Li Xian's treasurer.

5000|$|In a letter, Iran's Leader Ali Khamenei wrote that, Two {{weeks ago}} Martyr Kazemi {{came to see}} me. He told me, “I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do me two favors. First, pray to Almighty Allah that I will end up as an honorable person. Second, pray that I will attain martyrdom.”I told him, “It will really be a pity if you and others like you die an {{ordinary}} death. You {{and others who have}} passed through all those crucial stages should not die. You should all end up as martyrs. However, it is not yet time for this, since our country and our Islamic system still need you.”I further said, “The day when I was informed about the martyrdom of General Sayyad-Shirazi, I said that he was worthy of martyrdom, that he deserved to be martyred. It would have been a pity if he had died an ordinary death.”When I said this, the eyes of Martyr Kazemi became filled with tears, and he told me, “God willing, you will receive the news of my martyrdom too!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have already}} spoken of the history, {{so far as}} it is known, of some of the places round us--'Castra Regis,' 'Diana's Grove,' and 'The Lair of the White Worm.'

6000|$|... 'To meet my {{grandmother}} at Islington, if you please, sir,' said Charley. 'I have permission from Mr. Oldeschole to attend upon {{her for the}} rest of the day--perhaps you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him.'

2500|$|Health {{insurance}} costs have risen over 36 {{percent over the}} last four years according to the Washington Post. We're paying more. We're getting less.
