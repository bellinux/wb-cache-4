50|$|Skuas {{are related}} to <b>gulls,</b> <b>waders,</b> <b>auks,</b> <b>and</b> skimmers. In the three smaller species, all nesting {{exclusively}} in the Holarctic, breeding adults have the two central tail feathers obviously elongated, and at least some adults have white on the underparts and pale yellow on the neck. These characteristics are not shared by the larger species, all native to the Southern Hemisphere except for the great skua. Therefore, the skuas are often split into two genera, with only the smaller species retained in Stercorarius, and the large species placed in Catharacta. However, based on genetics, behavior, and feather lice, the overall relationship among the species is best expressed by placing all in a single genus. The pomarine and great skuas' mitochondrial DNA (inherited from the mother) is in fact {{more closely related to}} each other than it is to either Arctic or long-tailed skuas, or to the Southern Hemisphere species. Thus, hybridization must have played a considerable role {{in the evolution of the}} diversity of Northern Hemisphere skuas.|$|R

50|$|There are 215 common {{birds in}} Qatar. The desert and the {{shoreline}} form an important resting {{site for a}} number of migratory bird species during autumn and spring. Coastal birds include gulls, terns, turnstones, sanderlings, kentish plovers, herons and Socotra cormorants. They are usually observed year-round. Lark species, including hoopoes, crested larks and ashy-crowned sparrow-larks are commonly observed in the desert during the summer. More commonly occurring species during the autumn and spring are swallows, swifts, house martins, warblers, redstarts, shrikes, wheatears, wagtails, harriers and falcons (including kestrels). Four of the primary types of birds which can be observed in deserts during the winter are various types of <b>waders</b> <b>and</b> <b>gulls,</b> coots, <b>and</b> little grebes.

60|$|It was {{a lovely}} Arctic day. The sun shone with unclouded splendour, and the bright air, which trembled with that {{liquidity}} of appearance that one occasionally sees in very hot weather under peculiar circumstances, was vocal with the wild music of thousands of <b>gulls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>auks,</b> <b>and</b> other sea-birds, which clustered on the neighbouring cliffs, and flew overhead in clouds. All round, the pure surfaces of the ice-fields were broken by the shadows which the hummocks and bergs cast over them, and by the pools of clear water which shone like crystals in their hollows, while the beautiful beryl blue of the larger bergs gave a delicate colouring to the dazzling scene. Words cannot describe the intense glitter that characterised everything. Every point seemed a diamond; every edge sent forth a gleam of light, {{and many of the}} masses reflected the rich prismatic colours of the rainbow. It seemed as if the sun himself had been multiplied in order to add to the excessive brilliancy, for he was surrounded by parhelia, or sun-dogs as the men called them. This peculiarity in the sun's appearance was very striking. The great orb of day was about ten degrees above the horizon, and a horizontal line of white passed completely through it extending to a considerable distance on either hand, while around it were two distinct halos, or circles of light. On the inner halo were situated the mock-suns, which were four in number--one above and one below the sun, and one on each side of him.|$|R

40|$|The sandmason worm (Lanice conchilega, Annelid polychaete, Pallas 1766) ranges widely along European seashores. Locally very abundant, this ‘engineer species' {{is known}} to locally {{increase}} biodiversity, and could {{play a crucial role}} in trophic networks. Sandmason worms have high water filtration potential, and the clusters that they constitute are attractive feeding grounds for birds (<b>waders</b> <b>and</b> <b>gulls)</b> <b>and</b> fishes (especially flat fishes). By the example of the Chausey Archipelago and the Bay of the Mont Saint-Michel (France), we propose a conceptual approach to evaluate the conservation stakes of these habitats. On the study sites, this habitat turns out to be not only one of the richest in terms of raw biological diversity, but also one of the most attractive habitats for birds. Furthermore, they may have an important socio-economic value. The conservation stakes of sandmason worm habitats, which are sensitive and have heritage interest, is discussed within the context of an integrated and sustainable coastal management policy. The issue is even more pressing when one considers that these habitats still do not benefit from any legal protection...|$|R
30|$|Bi-parental care {{occurs in}} most monogamous bird species with altricial or semi-precocial young (Lack 1968; Clutton-Brock 1991; Székely et al. 2007). Such birds exhibit {{more or less}} divided parental duties during nesting; on the one hand, there are species in which {{both males and females}} {{cooperate}} in incubation, brooding, food provisioning, or nest defense (e.g., <b>waders,</b> <b>gulls,</b> <b>auks,</b> pigeons, <b>and</b> passerines), and on the other hand, there are species in which males and females have strictly divided parental task; females usually incubate and brood, while males provide most food for the young and female (e.g., most diurnal raptors and owls).|$|R
40|$|Seabirds {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their life at sea rather than on land.

Several species of sea ducks (Merganini) also spend much of their life in marine waters. Other bird groups contain pelagic members such as swimming shorebirds (Phalaropodidae), but they seldom interact with groundfish fisheries and, therefore, will not be discussed further.

Results Sixty-eight (42 %) of 161 charadriiform microsatellite loci were assigned to a single location in the chicken genome based on their E-value. Fifty-five primers designed from conserved microsatellite loci with an E-value of E- 10 or lower amplified across a wider range of charadriiform species than a control group of primers from ten anonymous microsatellite loci. Twenty-three of 24 examined conserved markers were polymorphic, each in on average 3 of 12 species tested. Conclusion Genomic sequence databases are useful tools to identify conserved genetic markers including those located in non-coding regions. By maximising primer sequence similarity between source species and database species, markers can be further improved and provide additional markers to study the molecular ecology of populations of non-model organisms. </p...|$|R
50|$|Beach meadows {{offers a}} variety of {{opportunities}} to many birds, primarily <b>waders,</b> ducks <b>and</b> <b>gulls.</b> Many species are resting here during tides and they are feeding in the small ponds. A number of bird species use them as breeding grounds, especially on islands without predators like fox, mustelidae (raccoon dogs, wolverines, polecats, etc.) or the like. Introducing even small numbers of predators to beach meadow habitats, can wreak havoc on the bird populations, as they have unrestricted access to eggs and birds.|$|R
40|$|Up to 95 % of {{wetlands}} in southwestern Ontario, Canada, have been drained and converted to {{other land uses}} since the mid- 1800 s. Remaining wetlands now exist within a mosaic of urban and agriculture land cover and may resemble “islands” {{from the point of}} view of species that need this habitat. We investigated the relationships between waterbirds and wetland size, isolation, and adjacent forest cover and roads in 19 wetlands within and adjacent to London, Ontario. Waterbirds were grouped into resource-based guilds: Dabblers, Divers, <b>Waders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gulls</b> <b>and</b> Terns (because of small samples, the Passerine and Raptor guilds were dropped from the statistical analyses). Because of the high degree of multicollinearity between variables, we used log-linear analysis to develop models that explained variations in species richness in the waterbird guilds. The log-linear technique provided quantification of environmental effects in a richer way than previous research as the interplay between biophysical factors found in reality are partially captured by the inclusion of interaction in the habitat models. All of the models incorporated the biophysical variables of wetland size and adjacent wetland area, forest cover, and roads. Waterbirds in these urban and near-urban landscapes appear to be using all wetlands available to them, no matter how small or how disjunct the wetland. This has implications for wetland evaluations that may not rate wetlands in human-dominated landscapes highly enough to be protected from development...|$|R
