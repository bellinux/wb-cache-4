5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} of his success, along <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, {{including}} how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{the nature of the}} altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, a {{panel is}} {{held for the}} office so that audience members can ask them questions. Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) openly states his distaste for the documentary. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is pressed <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> why she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures. Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) finally meets her birth parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Joan Cusack) who had put her up for adoption.|$|E

Other than the trip by Laurence, little is known of the activities of the missionaries in the period from their arrival until 601. Gregory mentions the mass conversions, and there is mention of Augustine working miracles that helped win converts, but there is little evidence of specific events.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E

25|$|In {{the city}} of Yokohama in March and October food was served to 800 people with dried shiitake-mushrooms that came from a farm near this town at a {{distance}} of 250kilometer from Fukushima.

25|$|The {{method is}} a {{continuous}} process {{that begins with}} observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.|$|E
25|$|Mommsen was a {{delegate}} to the Prussian House of Representatives from 186366 and again from 187379, and {{delegate to the}} Reichstag from 1881–1884, at first for the liberal German Progress Party (Deutsche Fortschrittspartei), later for the National Liberal Party, and finally for the Secessionists. He was very concerned <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> academic and educational policies and held national positions. Although he had supported German Unification, he was disappointed with {{the politics of the}} German Empire and he was quite pessimistic about its future. Mommsen strongly disagreed with Otto von Bismarck about social policies in 1881, advising collaboration between Liberals and Social Democrats and using such strong language that he narrowly avoided prosecution.|$|E
