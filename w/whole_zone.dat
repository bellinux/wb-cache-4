25|$|The London IAZ {{extended}} from Cheshunt and Dagenham {{in the east}} to Bexley and Mitcham {{in the south and}} to Richmond and Northolt in the west. The HAA positions were sited to produce an optimum density of fire of at least 16 guns engaging any one raid simultaneously. It had been intended that 26th AA Brigade would control the <b>whole</b> <b>zone,</b> but it proved too complex for one HQ, and in September 1939 it was divided among three: 26th AA Bde (34 sites disposed to north and east), 48th AA Bde (28 sites to south-east and south), and 49th AA Bde (12 sites to west). 26th AA Brigade still had the heaviest concentration of guns, mainly static 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch guns, with sites being increased from four to eight guns each. 48th AA Brigade had a mixture of 3.7 and 4.5-inch guns, half of the former being mobile. 49th AA Brigade had older 3-inch guns, but also controlled a higher proportion of LAA sites at Vital Points (VPs). Superimposed on the IAZ were the 73 searchlight sites controlled by 38th AA Bde.|$|E
500|$|In economics, an optimum {{currency}} area, {{or region}} (OCA or OCR), is a geographical region {{in which it}} would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by Robert Mundell: the stationary expectations model and the international risk sharing model. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro. However, even before {{the creation of the}} single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the late-2000s recession the chances of a state leaving the euro, or the chances that the <b>whole</b> <b>zone</b> would collapse, were considered extremely slim. However the Greek government-debt crisis led to former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form. Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for The New Yorker, explains it: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{boundary}} between Ibn Saud's territories of Najd and the Eastern Province and the British protectorate of Kuwait was first {{regulated by the}} Al Uqair Convention in 1922. In an effort to avoid territorial disputes, another diamond-shaped Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone of 5,790 square kilometers directly south of Kuwait was established. In 1938 oil was discovered in Kuwait's southern Burqan fields, and both countries [...] contracted with foreign oil companies to perform exploration work in the Divided Zone. After years of discussions, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reached an agreement in 1965 that divided the zone geographically, with each country administering its half of the zone. The agreement guaranteed that the rights of both parties to the natural resources in the <b>whole</b> <b>zone</b> {{would continue to be}} respected after each country had annexed its half of the zone in 1966.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure of a}} single MoS 2 monolayer is investigated with all electron first-principles calculations based on Kohn Sham Density Functional Theory and variational treatment of spin 2 ̆ 013 orbital coupling. The topologies of the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum are explored over the <b>whole</b> Brillouin <b>zone.</b> The single MoS 2 monolayer is confirmed to be a direct band gap semiconductor. The projected density of states (PDOS) of a single monolayer is calculated and {{compared to that of}} bulk MoS 2. The effective masses and the orbital character of the band edges at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone are determined. The spin-splittings of the conduction band minimum (CBMIN) and valence band maximum (VBMAX) are calculated over the <b>whole</b> Brillouin <b>zone.</b> It is found that the maximum spin-splitting of VBMAX is attained at the K point of the Brillouin zone and is responsible for the experimentally observed splitting between the A 1 and B 1 excitons.

This flexured area, called the Carpathian Foredeep, was filled by thick formations of molasse, prevailingly marls, sandstones and conglomerates that were formed in the Oligocene to Miocene periods by erosion of the growing Carpathians. Nevertheless, the foredeep is not generally folded; flysch nappes thrusted from the south partially folded the rock underneath.
