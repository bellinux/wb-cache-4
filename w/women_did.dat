5|$|In 1966, Canadian Lady {{made several}} {{important}} changes to their advertising strategy. They introduced television advertising {{and changed the}} emphasis from the product to the brand. Ads attempted to build consumer awareness of the single brand name: Wonderbra. Market research showed that <b>women</b> <b>did</b> not want girdles advertised on television—girdles were seen as armor against sex, while bras provided a means of attraction.|$|E
5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If <b>women</b> <b>did</b> attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of media about lesbians {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by <b>women</b> <b>did</b> not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|E

5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam laundry machine in the mid-19thcentury, <b>women</b> <b>did</b> most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam-driven washing machines, and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible {{by the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>did</b> much to {{establish}} the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics {{in the name of}} social issues.|$|E

The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston awarded her the first Paige Traveling Scholarship in 1899. Hazelton won an Honorable Mention at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in 1901.|$|E

5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. <b>Women</b> <b>did</b> not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (<b>women</b> <b>did</b> {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
5|$|When Richard {{was five}} years old, his mother {{gave birth to a}} younger brother, Henry Philips, who died at four weeks of age on February 25, 1924. Four years later, Richard's sister Joan was born, and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though {{separated}} by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, as they both shared a natural curiosity about the world. Their mother thought that <b>women</b> <b>did</b> not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things. Despite their mother's disapproval of Joan's desire to study astronomy, Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe. Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council. The women's variant of the game is similar to the men's version, with minor modifications to umpiring and pitch requirements. The first women's ODI was played in 1973, between England and Australia. Due to the sporting boycott placed upon their country, South Africa <b>women</b> <b>did</b> not contest their first ODI until August 1997, playing Ireland in Belfast. Later that year, South Africa entered the Women's Cricket World Cup for the first time, and were eliminated in the quarter-finals. They went one better in 2000, reaching the semi-finals, but since then have finished seventh twice (2005 and 2009) and sixth (2013), before reaching the semi-finals once more in 2017. They were required to compete in a qualifying series to confirm their place in the 2009 (World Cup 2009 qualifier) and 2013 (World Cup 2013 qualifier) tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Bernardina later {{married a}} Venezuelan immigrant, Estanislao Asencio Velázquez, {{continuing}} Cofresí's blood lineage in Cabo Rojo to this day. She had seven children: José Lucas, María Esterlina, Antonio Salvador, Antonio Luciano, Pablo, María Encarnación and Juan Bernardino. One of Cofresí's most notable descendants was Ana González, better known by her married name Ana G. Méndez. Cofresí's great-granddaughter, Méndez was directly {{descended from the}} Cabo Rojo bloodline through her mother Ana González Cofresí. Known for her interest in education, {{she was the first}} member of her branch of the Cofresí family to earn a high-school diploma and university degree. A teacher, Méndez founded the Puerto Rico High School of Commerce during the 1940s (when most <b>women</b> <b>did</b> not complete their education). By the turn of the 21st century her initiative had evolved into the Ana G. Méndez University System, the largest group of private universities in Puerto Rico. Other branches of the Cofresí family include Juan Francisco's descendants in Ponce, and Ignacio's lineage persists in the western region. Internationally, the Kupferschein family remains in Trieste. Another family member was Severo Colberg Ramírez, speaker of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico during the 1980s. Colberg made efforts to popularize Cofresí, particularly the heroic legends which followed his death. He was related to the pirate through his sister Juana, who married Germán Colberg.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man {{married into}} a woman's family after a {{courtship}} {{period during which}} the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man {{would no longer be}} required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household. It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is some indication that many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor. <b>Women</b> <b>did</b> the sewing, cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.|$|E

5|$|Stevens {{was very}} active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in Montevideo, Uruguay, the women {{presented}} their analysis of {{the legal status of}} women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the civil and political rights of women, it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women. Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, <b>women</b> <b>did</b> not have equal custody over their children, including in seven US states, and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and a woman could not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.|$|E
