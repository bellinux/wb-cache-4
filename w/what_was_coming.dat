25|$|Moreover, {{although}} {{before each}} {{series of tests}} Head and Rivers would discuss their plan of action, Rivers was careful to vary this order {{to such an extent}} during the actual testing that Head would be unable to tell <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> next.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Warren Publishing {{included}} an adaptation in Creepy #6. It {{was written by}} Archie Goodwin, with art by Reed Crandall. The ending borrows from the 1951 EC version, except for the murderer getting <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to him 50 years later. This version has been reprinted {{many times over the}} years.|$|E
25|$|Csonka claims that, as {{he walked}} away from the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which {{normally}} allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he would certainly have overruled Gibson had he heard <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, AIB's {{balance sheet}} {{indicated}} only limited impairment (bad debt) provisions. Their 2008 1st half financial report only accounts for an impairment provision of 0.21%. This {{does not appear}} to be consistent with the real negative changes taking place in property market fundamentals. The Central Bank told the Oireachtas Enterprise Committee that shareholders who lost their money in the banking collapse are to blame for their fate and got <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to them for not keeping bank chiefs in check, but did admit that the Central Bank had failed to give sufficient warning about reckless lending to property developers.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginians {{were warned}} of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> when Scipio sent his legate C. Laelius with a naval force to plunder {{the area of}} Hippo Regius on the African coast west of Carthage (205 BC). They took various {{measures}} to prevent a major Roman invasion. However, the attempt to persuade the Macedonian king Philip to invade Sicily was unsuccessful, and the reinforcements sent to their own commanders in Bruttium and Liguria were not sufficient to revive the war in Italy (see the articles about the battle of Croton and the Po valley raid). Nor was Scipio dissuaded by the defection of Syphax, who took the side of Carthage thanks to the diplomatic skills of Hasdrubal Gisgo and the charms of his daughter, Sophonisba.|$|E
25|$|News, {{sport and}} {{detailed}} weather reports were presented on the half-hour. As of 6 August 2012 either Henry or Robinson also presented news headlines on the quarter-hour. In addition Metropolitan viewers also received regular traffic updates for their respective city from SUNA traffic. Until 3 August 2012 after the 8:30am news, the hosts crossed to Yumi Stynes, Gorgi Coghlan or another Circle guest host {{to find out}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> up on The Circle. The hosts were joined by Wendell Sailor and Roger Oldridge respectively to preview and review NRL and AFL matches Monday and Friday mornings at 6:40am during the respective seasons. Viewers were able to express their views by phoning the Henry Hotline, a talkback radio style segment; these calls were replayed later in the show.|$|E

25|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} every Dragon Ball anime series and {{subsequent}} related media, Goku has been voiced by Masako Nozawa. Toriyama selected Nozawa upon hearing her audition sample, remarking that only Goku could sound like that. Nozawa stated {{that she was}} ecstatic when she got the role because she {{had always wanted to}} be in one of Toriyama's works. She said she had to be mindful of the fact that Goku grew up in the mountains and did not know much of the world. Despite having to voice Goku, Gohan, Goten and Burdock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image. Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> in the story until recording, making her reactions the same as Goku's.|$|E
500|$|Before Rolling Thunder {{even began}} the North Vietnamese {{leadership}} knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> It issued a February 1965 directive {{to the military}} and the population to [...] "maintain communication and transportation and to expect the complete destruction of the entire country, including Hanoi and Haiphong." [...] The communist leadership declared [...] "a people's war against the air war of destruction...each citizen is a soldier, each village, street, and plant a fortress on the anti-American battlefront." [...] All except those deemed [...] "truly indispensable {{to the life of the}} capital" [...] were evacuated to the countryside. By 1967, Hanoi's population had been reduced by half.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Journalist Joshua Prager {{published}} {{that the}} Giants secretly learned opponents' finger signals, when several players told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on July 20, 1951, the team used a telescope and buzzer wire {{to steal the}} finger signals of opposing catchers careless enough to leave their signs unprotected. Giants catcher Sal Yvars told Prager that he relayed to Thomson the stolen sign for Branca's fastball. Thomson always insisted {{that he had no}} foreknowledge of Branca's pitch. Branca had been aware of the rumors and was skeptical of Thomson's denial, but later told The New York Times in 2001, [...] "I didn't want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball. And even if Bobby knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> he had to hit it.... Knowing the pitch doesn't always help." ...|$|E

500|$|In December News.com.au's Confidential {{reporter}} {{alleged that}} Hi-5's production company had asked Crawford and Foley to leave, {{and that the}} company were [...] "opting to recruit younger, cheaper performers." [...] The pair remained silent {{in response to these}} reports. Later in December, Park also announced she would be leaving the group, expressing she expected to only be a temporary replacement. Park denied the industry rumours, saying that there had been no pressure for any of them to resign. The departing members finished the Australian Playtime tour together and had their final performance at Carols by Candlelight on Christmas Eve in Melbourne. Of the large cast change, in later years Burgess revealed it had been a difficult transition. [...] "We didn't know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> up for a moment there," [...] she said, [...] "It was just [...] and I going, 'OK, what's happening now?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{the second}} new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall {{returned}} but {{appeared to be}} tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. At {{the start of the}} third morning, he bowled Alec Bedser off an inside edge from a bouncer to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task...and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." [...] Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to them.|$|E
500|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser and Wright survived for 20 minutes, and Lindwall {{tried to break}} their {{resistance}} by aiming a few bouncers at the former. Bedser eventually inside edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135-run first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70, while Johnson took 3/72 and Johnston 2/43. Toshack was the other bowler used, sending down 18 overs {{for the loss of}} 23 runs. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice his bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried his captain had noticed the injury, but Bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler."

500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination because of race or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, but I will not have them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> and if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else could they do but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E

2500|$|Faut was {{a pitcher}} with an {{analytical}} mind that {{allowed her to}} remember pitching sequences from batter to batter and game to game.

[...] "Part of my success", she once reflected, [...] "was that in my mind I could record the order of pitches I threw to each girl, so they never saw the same thing twice". She added [...] "I was a mathematical whiz in school. They’d never know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> so they’d start guessing".|$|E
2500|$|Between 1530 and 1531, captain Alonso de Ávila {{on his way}} to Ciudad Real accidentally {{discovered}} the lagoon and hill of Lacam-Tún.

The Spaniards tried in vain to conquer the lacandones: from Nueva España Juan Enríquez de Guzman tried; from the Yucatán Peninsula tried Francisco de Montejo; Pedro de Alvarado attempted it from Guatemala along with captain Francisco Gil Zapata and, finally, Pedro Solórzano from Chiapas.
