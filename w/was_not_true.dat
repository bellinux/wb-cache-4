5|$|As this {{statement}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> Alvarez was indicted {{for violating the}} Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, {{the place where the}} trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that the Act was unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael spreads a rumor about Stanley having an affair, then spreads a series of false rumors to try to convince everyone the original rumor <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> The rumors cause Andy to question his sexuality, and Pam and Jim to debate whether or not to tell the office that Pam is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|While France {{respected}} the deadline, the Libyans limited themselves to retiring some forces, while maintaining at least 3,000 men stationed in Northern Chad. When this became evident, it embarrassed the French and caused recriminations between the French and Chadian governments. On 16 November, Mitterrand met with Gaddafi on Crete, {{under the auspices}} of the Greek prime minister Papandreou. Despite Gaddafi's declaration that all Libyan forces had been withdrawn, the next day Mitterrand admitted that this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> However, he did not order French troops back to Chad.|$|E
50|$|Assume {{there is}} an n such that Sn is true. Then Sn + 1 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> so there <b>is</b> some k > n + 1 such that Sk is <b>true.</b> But Sk <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> because Sn <b>is</b> true and k > n. Assuming Sn is true implies a contradiction, Sk <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> so our {{assumption}} is absurd. We must conclude for each i, the sentence Si <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> But if Si <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> it <b>is</b> also true, so we have the paradox that each sentence in Yablo's list <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and <b>not</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R

It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> that abstract mathematics was evolved antecedently to, and independently of concrete mathematics. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> that of the subdivisions of abstract mathematics, the more general came before the more special.

5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children {{had been killed by}} peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
5|$|Menzies became prime {{minister}} again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be {{promoted to the}} rank of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the Governor-General, William McKell, to the War Office in London, which replied that a dominion officer could not be promoted to the rank. Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted to field marshal because he was a retired officer, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted to field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. V. Hickman {{took over}} from Caine as {{commanding}} officer on 26 August 1968 {{and the rest}} of the year was uneventful for the RLI. The same <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> however, for the Rhodesian government, which on 20 September 1968 accepted an invitation from Wilson for a new round of talks, this time aboard HMS Fearless, anchored off Gibraltar, for four days starting on 9 October 1968. These ended without agreement on the evening of 13 October 1968, when Smith flew back to Rhodesia. Unsuccessful attempts by both sides to salvage an accord from the Fearless talks continued for months afterwards but ultimately Smith's government resolved that compromise was impossible. It prepared a new constitution of its own and on 20 June 1969 called a constitutional referendum, polling public opinion on both the new constitution and the adoption of a republican form of government. The electorate firmly backed both of these proposals. As a result, Rhodesia became a republic with the new constitution in place on 2 March 1970.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
