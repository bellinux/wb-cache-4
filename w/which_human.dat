5|$|Addington Long Barrow is a {{chambered}} long barrow {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber in <b>which</b> <b>human</b> remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E
50|$|The first {{controversy}} {{to resolve}} {{was related to}} the very origin of the human rights, basically the discussion between the supporters of the concepts of natural rights (<b>which</b> <b>humans</b> are endowed by God or Nature) and positive rights (<b>which</b> <b>humans</b> acquire {{as a result of a}} rational agreement).|$|R

5|$|One of {{the main}} targets chosen by the HOPE study was Callisto. The {{possibility}} of building a surface base on Callisto was proposed, because of the low radiation levels at its distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only Galilean satellite for <b>which</b> <b>human</b> exploration is feasible. The levels of ionizing radiation on Io, Europa, and Ganymede are hostile to human life, and adequate protective measures {{have yet to be}} devised.|$|E
5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in <b>which</b> <b>human</b> intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{selected for}} the barrow had witnessed inhabitation during the preceding Mesolithic period, as evidenced by a nearby hearth and scatters of knapped flint tools. Built out of earth and local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into <b>which</b> <b>human</b> remains were deposited, alongside sherds of pottery vessels.|$|E

5|$|Built out {{of earth}} and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow {{consisted}} of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into <b>which</b> <b>human</b> remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the Early Neolithic. Osteoarchaeological analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals, a mixture of men, women, children and adults. At least one of the bodies had been dismembered before burial, potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of excarnation and secondary burial. As with other barrows, Coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead, perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration, although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious, ritual, and cultural connotations and uses.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in <b>which</b> <b>human</b> characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E

25|$|The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the Slack Farm in Kentucky, in <b>which</b> <b>human</b> {{remains were}} tossed {{to the side}} while relics were stolen, made {{national}} news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves. Likewise, several protests at the Dickson Mounds site in Illinois, where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the new American {{corporation}} Genentech, after {{collaboration with}} Kabi, developed and started trials of recombinant {{human growth hormone}} (rHGH) made by a new technology (recombinant DNA) in <b>which</b> <b>human</b> genes were inserted into bacteria {{so that they could}} produce unlimited amounts of the protein.

25|$|Rastas do {{not believe}} that there is a {{specific}} afterlife to <b>which</b> <b>human</b> individuals go following bodily death.

25|$|Although BPM {{initially}} {{focused on}} the automation of business processes {{with the use of}} information technology, it has since been extended to integrate human-driven processes in <b>which</b> <b>human</b> interaction takes place in series or parallel with the use of technology.

25|$|Neuroscience as an {{interdisciplinary}} field, and its branch of cognitive neuroscience particularly, operates under the ontological assumption of physicalism. In other words, it assumes—in order to perform its science—that only the fundamental phenomena studied by physics exist. Thus, neuroscience seeks to understand mental phenomena {{within the framework}} according to <b>which</b> <b>human</b> thought and behavior are caused solely by physical processes taking place inside the brain, and it operates by the way of reductionism by seeking {{an explanation for the}} mind in terms of brain activity.|$|E
25|$|His satirical works {{depict the}} second world, in <b>which</b> <b>human</b> flaws are caricatured {{with little regard}} for actual or {{historical}} truth. Though critics call attention to these anachronisms and narrative inconsistencies, it's possible that Vicente considered these errors trivial in his portrayals of an already false and imperfect world. In contrast, his representations of the mythic, symbolic, and religious aspects of Christmas, such as the figure of the Virgin Mother, the infant Jesus, and Christmas eve, demonstrate a harmony and purity which is not present in his social commentary.|$|E
