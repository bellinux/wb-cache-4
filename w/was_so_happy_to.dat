"Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it {{four out of}} five stars. Forcella praised the Jim–Dwight dynamic in the episode and wrote, [...] "Jim and Dwight, and especially the latter, were terrific." [...] In addition, Forcella positively compared the character growth of Nellie Bertam to Michael Scott, noting [...] "the most heartwarming moment [...] her scene with Pam, in which Nellie <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have made a friend, reminded me of so many Michael Scott moments of the past." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger from The California Literary Review wrote moderately positive of the episode, saying, [...] "Tonight's episode worked for the most part thanks to the ever reliable Robert California and the usually reliable Jim and Dwight: Partners." [...] However, he did retroactively criticize season eight for not elaborating on the problems facing Dunder Mifflin until [...] "Turf War". In addition, he called the premise of Andy seeking Wallace's help [...] "iffy ... even if it was predictable". Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave wrote, [...] "The immediate, don't over-analyze opinion here is that 'Turf War' is a top three episode of season 8, with a chance of it being number one." [...] Furthermore, he concluded that the episode [...] "was good, very good, and a nice way to get set for the season/series finale. ... The Office can still bring it when it wants to." ...|$|E

500|$|R {{singer and}} friend Brandy {{said about the}} late singer [...] "She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record {{companies}} {{did not believe in}} kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. When I met her I embraced her, I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> meet her." [...] Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E
500|$|Filmed in Los Angeles, {{the music}} video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, {{director}} of the video for her 1997 single, [...] "Honey". Since its release, Carey claimed it {{to be one of}} her favorite videos, due to its complex scenery and fun nature. She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - did you see it? And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, a nice time. OK, I'll say he definitely {{did a very good job}} in the video." [...] Additionally, Carey and Hunter placed several secrets within the video's scenery, that would be intended for the [...] "die-hard fans". Following the video's completion, it premiered on MTV and several other music video channels on November 1, 2005. Aside from the video's script, Carey channeled Marilyn Monroe, one of her icons growing up. During a pool scene, Carey re-enacts a part from Monroe's film Something's Got to Give (1962). In an interview with MTV News, Carey spoke of the re-enactment: ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline began {{on-screen}} when Nicole {{started dating}} Elliot Gillen (Paul Pantano). He had a vendetta against Roman and kidnapped Nicole and Geoff {{and left them}} stranded out at sea. They washed up on a deserted island and were forced to survive without food and clothing. Describing the effect it had on Nicole and Geoff, James stated: [...] "They have no food, shelter or clothing. [...] They find moments to make each other laugh, though, and realise how much they mean to one another." [...] Geoff had strong religious views and {{did not believe in}} premarital sex. However, the environment they were in caused him to let his guard down and they slept together. Lewis told TV Week that all the pair could think of whilst trapped was being rescued and their feelings for one an other. He added that [...] "the fact they were both pretty much naked didn't help". He concluded the fact they were both kids, trying to keep warm - that then [...] "stuff happens". Geoff was left [...] "guilt-ridden" [...] because he gave into temptation. He did not regret it, but acknowledged that he wanted to save his virginity until marriage. Therefore, Geoff saw no other option but to propose to Nicole. Lewis stated, [...] "He's not 100% sure about that either, but he feels that if they're going to have sex, a wedding is the only solution." [...] Describing Nicole's reaction he said that she was [...] "dumbfounded" [...] by his offer, as she had believed he was acting strange because he wanted to dump her. Nicole refused when she realised his reasons for proposing. According to James, the moment managed to ruin their passion, she also commented that: [...] "Nicole has liked Geoff for ages and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have got together with him - but now he's spoiled it." [...] James also admitted she was trilled to learn Nicole would turn down his proposal. James later opined that Nicole was [...] "the one" [...] for Geoff, but did not believe that Geoff was [...] "the one" [...] for Nicole.|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|European {{commissioner}} and Vice-President Margot Wallström was criticised after she informally suggested support for Royal on her blog, celebrating {{the fact that}} a woman got into the second round.

[...] (I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see that a woman would be participating {{in the second round of}} the presidential election!) Commissioners are not meant to be politically biased in elections under their code of conduct. [...] It should be noted that Wallström is a social-democrat, like Royal.

2500|$|It is bad {{etiquette}} {{to offer}} a draw in a clearly lost position , , or even when one has no winning chances but the opponent still has winning chances [...] Garry Kasparov regularly criticizes grandmasters who offer a draw when their position is worse [...] But such offers are sometimes used as psychological tricks. The position in the diagram on the right arose in the game Samuel Reshevsky versus Fotis Mastichiadis, Dubrovnik 1950. Reshevsky played 24.Nd2?, and saw at once that he is put into a very bad situation with 24...Nxf2. Thinking quickly, he offered his opponent a draw, who was busy writing down the move in his scoresheet.

2500|$|Pickering is {{an ancient}} market town and civil parish in the Ryedale {{district}} [...] of North Yorkshire, England, {{on the border of}} the North York Moors National Park. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it sits {{at the foot of the}} moors, overlooking the Vale of Pickering to the south. According to legend the town was founded by King Peredurus around 270BC; however, the town as it exists today is of medieval origin. The legend has it that the king lost his ring and accused a young maiden of stealing it, but later that day the ring was found in a pike caught in the River Costa for his dinner. The king <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> find his ring he married the young maiden; the name Pike-ring changed over the years to Pickering. It is a nice tale told to fit the name, but it is not the origin. Pickering is thought to be named after the followers of an Anglian man named Picer or some such personal name – the Picer-ingas.|$|E
