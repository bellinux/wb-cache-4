5|$|The team {{nickname}} is The Lions, previously The Dockers. The original Dockers name {{arose from}} the job {{of many of the}} club's supporters in the early 1900s. The club did not like the moniker and changed the nickname after press headlined Millwall as 'Lions of the South', after knocking Football League leaders Aston Villa out of the 1899–1900 FA Cup. Millwall, then a Southern League side, went on to reach the semi-final. The club adopted the motto: We Fear No Foe Where E'er <b>We</b> <b>Go.</b> <b>In</b> the 2000s the club started to recognise its unique link with London's docks by introducing Dockers' Days, and archiving the club's dock roots in the Millwall FC Museum. Dockers' Days bring together past successful Millwall teams who parade on the pitch at half-time. Supporters who were dockers are allowed to attend the game for free. In 2011, Millwall officially named the east stand of The Den as the 'Dockers Stand' in honour of the club's former nickname.|$|E

Fields and Holloway first worked together on her film Sing As <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> 1934 and the two remained close friends {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E
500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come. The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is just where we're at right now with music." [...] Of the end result, drummer Vince Nudo said, [...] "Our individual tastes came out more [...] [...] It's more organic. We're not holding back so much." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{sought to}} record the album in an {{unconventional}} setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired {{to set up a}} recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house. The band decided that they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said [...] "There are definitely ghosts in the house," [...] and Frusciante felt they were [...] "very friendly. We [...] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> this house." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final two}} {{performances}} {{were held in}} Tempe, Arizona on 19 and 20 December 1987 and were filmed for the 1988 film Rattle and Hum. U2 sang the refrain [...] "el pueblo vencerá", which means [...] "the people will overcome" [...] in Spanish, {{at the conclusion of}} the song. Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said [...] "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, we felt that maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric." [...] Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song [...] "40", and so they were looking to replace it with [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] from that point on. He explained, [...] "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a way for the next few years, that will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment ...". The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it. [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] was used as the final live song, and [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] was chosen to play over the credits.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{controversy}} surrounding the judges' comments over the audition of a Special Olympics participant named Jonathan Jayne. American Idol producer Ken Warwick responded saying that [...] "It's not a conscious decision, It's {{just that the}} further <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the series, there are less and less good singers, so the numbers are made up by more bad ones." [...] Warwick said that he thinks everyone {{has the right to}} audition, and added that in some instances when there are singers with certain disabilities who just want to meet the judges, the producers will [...] "turn the cameras off and bring them in. We give them a good experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Public {{perception}} is that the Iraqis were confrontational and blocking {{the work of the}} inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, [...] "Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq." [...] So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> with four people.|$|E
2500|$|Upon GOD's announcement, Alex Seropian, {{co-founder of}} Bungie, {{expressed}} confidence in MumboJumbo's {{ability to create}} a worthy successor to the original games, stating [...] "MumboJumbo has a real appreciation for what made the first two Myth games great. We're confident that their knowledge and experience will make Myth III a title that satisfies existing Myth fans and brings legions of new gamers into the fold." [...] Also addressing the issue of remaining faithful to the two previous games whilst still introducing new elements to the franchise, MumboJumbo president Mark Dochtermann explained the idea with The Wolf Age was not to reinvent the series' basic gameplay, which the developers felt was still capable of supporting a unique title. However, at the same time, they were also keen to try out new things; [...] "There's a lot left to explore in the Myth franchise even before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a somewhat different route. Although, we are taking a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now." [...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated [...] "We intend to pay respect to Myth and its fans. We don't care to change the whole appeal of the game just so we can call it ours." [...] With this in mind, MumboJumbo hired three members of Soulblighters modding community to work on the game. Although initially hired to work on technical aspects, they became invaluable to MumboJumbo in terms of writing the storyline. Executive producer Mike Donges explains, [...] "they're our Myth lore experts, so if we try to put in something new, they have the ability to [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{spent six}} months {{recording}} a new album, with long periods of rehearsal, songwriting, and incubating ideas. However, Rubin was dissatisfied with a regular recording studio, thinking the band would work better in a less orthodox setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired {{to set up a}} recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house.

We [...] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> this house." [...] Rubin is the current owner of the studio known as The Mansion. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album's recording was complete, the Chili Peppers released the film, titled Funky Monks. The band was unable to decide on the title of the album, but to Rubin, one particular song title stuck out: [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". Although it was not a featured song, Rubin believed it to be [...] "clearly the best title".|$|E
