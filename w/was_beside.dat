In antiquity it <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> the divine will which a man performs, just {{as much for the}} will of sexual desire. The intention of the individual was less understood as an overall, generalized, ontological place wherever it was arranged.|$|E

25|$|The Croydon Canal {{ran from}} New Cross {{to the site}} of West Croydon station. As it passed through South Norwood, pubs sprang up near its course.

The passageway through which bricks passed to the canal is still there. The Goat House pub (which has since been demolished) was said to have been named after an island in the canal on which goats were kept.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Indian Empire were laid by Sir Francis Day in the sandy delta of a tiny river, some {{three and a half}} miles north of Saint Thomas, with the beginnings of Fort St. George. The British invited the Portuguese of pure and mixed descent to settle in the new township; and as the Portuguese were Catholics, they were ministered to by the clergy from Saint Thomas. In 1642, the Congregation of Propaganda sent out two French Capuchins to establish a mission in Burma. But when they, landing at Surat and travelling overland, reached Fort St. George, the British persuaded them not to go further, judging it prudent to have clergymen differing in nationality from, and independent of, the Portuguese ordinary at Saint Thomas to minister to the Catholics in their settlement. Accordingly, R. P. Ephraim', one of the two, wrote to the Sacred Congregation de propaganda fide that there was a prospect of reaping a larger harvest at Fort St. George and the fast rising native town of Madras that <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> it, than in Burma; and in the name of Urban VIII an Apostolic prefecture was established within three and a half miles of the cathedral of Saint Thomas. Ever after there were continual bickerings between the local ordinaries and the French Capuchins, the former insisting on the Capuchins acknowledging their jurisdiction, a claim which the latter, relying on their papal Brief, refused to recognize.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} Round Tablers were inveterate {{practical}} jokers, constantly pulling pranks on one another. As {{time went on}} the jokes became ever more elaborate. Harold Ross and Jane Grant once spent weeks playing a particularly memorable joke on Woollcott involving a prized portrait of himself. They had several copies made, each slightly more askew than the last, and would periodically secretly swap them out and then later comment to Woollcott [...] "What on earth is wrong with your portrait?"

500|$|Following Crosby's Olympic {{gold medal}} victory with Canada in 2010, it was {{announced}} that his stick and glove were missing. It was initially suspected that they might have been stolen; Reebok Canada offered a reward of CAD$10,000 for their return—no questions asked. On March 10, the items were found; Crosby's stick had been placed in a shipment bound for the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in St. Petersburg, Russia (the shipment was intercepted in Toronto) and his glove was found in a hockey bag belonging to Patrice Bergeron whose [...] <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> Crosby's in the locker room.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} decade, the most {{fruitful}} of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss {{was greeted by}} an [...] "overwhelming ovation". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling [...] "dishonoured and dispirited." [...] This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim that followed the first performance of the complete Má vlast cycle in November: [...] "Everyone {{rose to his feet}} and the same storm of unending applause was repeated after each of the six parts... At the end of Blaník [...] the audience <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> itself and the people could not bring themselves to take leave of the composer." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{examples}} of [...] "Dad's Renaissance" [...] included a 1968 Off-Broadway production of Private Lives at the Theatre de Lys starring Elaine Stritch, Lee Bowman and Betsy von Furstenberg, {{and directed by}} Charles Nelson Reilly. Despite this impressive cast, Coward's popularity had risen so high that the theatre poster for the production used an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Coward (pictured) [...] instead of {{an image of the}} production or its stars. The illustration captures how Coward's image had changed by the 1960s: he was no longer seen as the smooth 1930s sophisticate, but as the doyen of the theatre. As The New Statesman wrote in 1964, [...] "Who would have thought the landmarks of the Sixties would include the emergence of Noël Coward as the grand old man of British drama? There he was one morning, flipping verbal tiddlywinks with reporters about [...] "Dad's Renaissance"; the next he <b>was...</b> <b>beside</b> Forster, T. S. Eliot and the OMs, demonstrably the greatest living English playwright." [...] Time wrote that [...] "in the 60s... his best work, with its inspired inconsequentiality, seemed to exert not only a period charm but charm, period." ...|$|E
500|$|... 150 people protested at the Church of Scientology {{building}} in Sydney, Australia, carrying signs and wearing costumes. Participants were masked {{to maintain their}} anonymity and avoid possible retaliation from the Church of Scientology. Protesters chanted [...] "Church on the left, cult on the right" [...] (in reference to the Church that <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> the Church of Scientology building), [...] "Religion is free" [...] and [...] "We want Xenu". Scientology staff locked down the building {{and set up a}} camera to record the event. After the protest in Sydney, a surge in online Internet traffic due to individuals attempting to view pictures from the protest crashed hundreds of websites when a server was overloaded. The Sydney protest {{was one of the first}} worldwide, and after the first images of the protest went online a surge in traffic drove the hosting company's bandwidth usage up by 900 percent. The hosting company Digitalis temporarily prevented access to hundreds of its clients' sites, and customer support representative Denis Kukic said the surge was unexpected: [...] "We had no advance notice that there was going to be a sudden surge of traffic or that there would be more than 100 times the average traffic that this customer's website normally consumes." ...|$|E
500|$|No {{artist was}} ever more true to his aim. Ideals resolutely pursued {{are apt to}} provoke the resentment of the world, and Burne-Jones encountered, endured and conquered an {{extraordinary}} amount of angry criticism. Insofar as this was directed against the lack of realism in his pictures, it <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> the point. The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, {{the men and women of}} Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, it has nothing of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred [...] "revolt from fact" [...] which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.|$|E

2500|$|In closing, the Court {{said that}} it fully {{rejected}} the respondents' argument that the statutory difference between assisted suicide and refusing lifesaving treatment was [...] "arbitrary" [...] and [...] "irrational." [...] It did concede that there were probably incidents where the two were {{likely to have the}} same result, but also said that such an argument <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> the point. The Court declared that New York [...] "obviously" [...] had a number of legitimate, compelling, and rational interests in enacting this ban. However, regardless of these reasons, it determined simply that the law permitted everyone to refuse treatment and prohibited everyone from assisting suicide; as such, the law did not run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause and the state had the constitutional authority to put such a law into place.|$|E

2500|$|Burger {{disagreed}} with the Court's assessment of the retribution and deterrence value {{of the death penalty}} for rape. He thought that the death penalty might deter at least one prospective rapist. It might encourage victims to report the crime. It might increase the general feeling of security among members of the community. The fact that the magnitude of the harm caused by the murderer is greater than that caused by the rapist <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> the point. The Eighth Amendment was not the Code of Hammurabi; if [...] "innocent life and limb are to be preserved I see no constitutional barrier in punishing by death all who engage in... criminal activity which consistently poses serious danger of death or serious bodily harm." [...] Thus, the Court had no place dictating how the states might make law in the criminal arena.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander's father-in-law, John William Graham, {{believed}} that Gandhi was a subversive {{and that the}} Indians were unprepared for self-government. At the Quaker yearly meeting in 1930 the Nobel prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore attacked British rule in India. The Quakers were disturbed by the address and John Graham was particularly outraged. Afterwards {{it was agreed that}} a representative would be sent to India to attempt a reconciliation between the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, and Gandhi. This task was assigned to Horace Alexander, who first met Gandhi in March 1928. He made it possible for Gandhi to attend the 1931 round-table conference in London. After the conference he founded the India Conciliation Group along with Agatha Harrison and Carl Heath. Becoming a close friend of Gandhi (who, in 1942, described Alexander as [...] "one of the best English friends India has"), he wrote extensively about his philosophy. In 1947 he attempted to intervene to control the violence between Muslims and Hindus and <b>was</b> <b>beside</b> Gandhi in Calcutta on 15 August 1947.|$|E
