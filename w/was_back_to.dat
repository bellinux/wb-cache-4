In January 2010, he reached a career-high ranking of world No. 4, after which del Potro had to withdraw from most of the tournaments in 2010 due to a right wrist injury. He returned in 2011 and <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> world No. 4 in January 2014 but had to withdraw from competition due to another wrist injury, but this time to his left wrist.|$|E

She hired a friend to conduct feeding operations in her absence, but <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> do it herself three days after surgery.|$|E

5|$|She later {{contacted}} Mulder, who <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> full {{health at}} the time, seeking help on a case she suspected had some link {{to the murder of}} Doggett's son. However, as before, she soon returned to her own work. Reyes remained with the New Orleans field office until she was called upon to protect agent Dana Scully in May 2001, driving her out to a remote location in Georgia so that the pregnant Scully might deliver her child out of harm's way. Reyes helped deliver the child, and made a permanent move soon afterwards, becoming Doggett's partner on The X-Files.|$|E
5|$|The arcs {{are quite}} stable structures. They were {{detected}} by ground-based stellar occultations in the 1980s, by Voyager 2 in 1989 and by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at {{approximately the same}} orbital longitudes. However some changes have been noticed. The overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986. The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness. Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them. Courage, a very faint arc found during the Voyager flyby, was seen to flare in brightness in 1998; it <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its usual dimness by June 2005. Visible light observations show that {{the total amount of}} material in the arcs has remained approximately constant, but they are dimmer in the infrared light wavelengths where previous observations were taken.|$|E
5|$|The impact Reeves had was immediate. As Bill Parcells {{had done}} before in 1984, Reeves named Phil Simms the {{starting}} quarterback and released Hostetler. They won their first three games, and five of their first six. The defense <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its Parcells-era levels and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two games to go, the Giants were 11–3 and battling for an Eastern Division crown and a first round bye. However, they were upset by Phoenix, 17–6, in the next to {{last week of the}} season, setting up a winner–take–all game against the Dallas Cowboys in the season finale. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first round game 17–10 over the Minnesota Vikings. However, they were then defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3, in their worst performance of the season in the second round.|$|E

25|$|Game 6 {{was a close}} game all along, and {{the lead}} kept {{fluctuating}} between the two teams. Again, the leading stars on both teams played big games.
