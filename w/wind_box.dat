40|$|In {{the thesis}} a study {{is made of}} the {{influence}} of natural convection on heat transfer in a composite system comprising a porous material heated from below and an air space situated above this. The measuring apparatus, a <b>Wind</b> <b>Box</b> which has been designed and developed at the Department of Building Physics is described. This apparatus is a prototype; its main difference from a traditional guarded hot plate apparatus is its large measuring area (0. 6 x 1. 2 m) over which the material can be installed up to a thickness of 0. 5 m and its thermal resistance when exposed to an upwards heat flux determined. In designing the measuring process, calculation of the maximum systematic error has been a control parameter; this is less than 6 %. The study includes a review of the literature, measurements in a horizontal guarded hot plate apparatus, measurements in the <b>Wind</b> <b>Box</b> and calculations with a recently developed simulation program (CONVBOX) for three-dimensional convection problems.

40|$|For modern highly or fully {{automated}} helicopters, both the airspeed and the airflow angles {{have to be}} determined as accurately as possible. Research projects dealing with enhancements of in-flight simulation, model following or automatic trajectory control - among them the current DLR ALLFlight (Assisted Low Level Flight and Landing on Unprepared Landing Site) project – need accurate knowledge of the actual helicopter state. Due to rotor downwash, helicopter airspeed measurement in the low speed range via fuselage mounted pitot tubes is inherently prone to errors. The EC- 135 Flying Helicopter Simulator (FHS) of DLR is therefore equipped with noseboom mounted sensors to enable measurements relatively unperturbed by rotor downwash effects.

This {{paper is}} focused on the {{numerical}} simulation of a new technology of small size iron ore sintering machine using gaseous fuel and oxygen injections to produce high quality of sinter product for the blast furnace operation. The proposed methodology is to partially replace the solid fuel(coke breeze) by steelworks gases in a compact machine to enhance heat and mass transfer. A multiphase mathematical model based on transport equations of momentum, energy and chemical species coupled with chemical reaction rates and phase transformations is proposed to analyze the inner process parameters. A base case representing a possible actual industrial operation of the sintering machine is used in order to compare different scenarios of possible operations which represents advanced operations techniques. The model was used to predict four cases of fuel gas utilization: a) 3 % of the <b>wind</b> <b>boxes</b> inflow from N 01 -N 10 <b>wind</b> <b>boxes</b> of natural gas(NG) and oxygen, b) same condition with coke oven gas(COG) and c) mixture of 80 % COG and 20 % blast furnace gas(BFG). The model predictions indicated that for all cases, the sintering zone is enlarged and the solid fuel consumption is decreased about 12 kg/t of sinter product for the best combination. In order to maximize the steelworks gas utilization it is recommended the use of mixture of COG and BFG with optimum inner temperature distribution within a compact sintering machine, which enhance the productivity and obviously, decrease the investment cost of the sintering facilities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{technology}} of fuel gas utilization on the iron ore sintering {{process has been}} proposed as an alternative for reducing the environmental load and improvements on the sinter quality have been obtained with additional decrease on the return of fines (< 5 mm). This paper deals with the numerical simulation of this innovative technology in order to evaluate the emissions of poly chlorinated di-benzene dioxin (PCDD) and Poly Chlorinated di-benzene furan (PCDF). The methodology is to partially replace solid fuel (coke breeze) by steelworks gaseous fuels; coke oven gas (COG), blast furnace gas (BFG) and mixture of these gases. A multiphase mathematical model based on transport equations of momentum, energy and chemical species coupled with chemical reaction rates and phase transformations is proposed to analyze the inner process parameters and the rates of PCDD and PCDF formations. A base case representing the actual industrial operation was used to validate the model and afterwards used as reference to predict four cases of fuel gas utilization: (a) 10 % of the <b>wind</b> <b>boxes</b> inflow from N 01 to N 12 <b>wind</b> <b>boxes</b> with COG, (b) same condition with BFG, (c) same condition with 50 % COG and 50 % BFG and (d) mixture of 25 % COG and 75 % BFG. The model predictions indicated that for all cases, except only BFG, the sintering zone is enlarged and the solid fuel consumption is decreased. In order to maximize the steelworks gas utilization it is recommended the use of mixture of COG and BFG with optimum inner temperature distribution. It was found out that for all cases of gas utilization the PCDD and PCDF emissions could be decreased due to enlargement of the high temperature zone on the sintering bed and hence increasing the residence time of the reacting gas within the high temperature zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{task of the}} projekt was {{to reduce}} the {{emissions}} of particulate matter and heavy metals from a sinter plant. For {{the first time in}} europe a fabric filter was installed after an existing electrostatic precipitator on a industrial level. Technical measurements established a efficient reduction of particulate matter, heavy metals and gaseous inorganic compounds (HCl, HF). The operation of the fabric filter prooved to be a practicable dedusting process. Blinding of the fabric materials caused by oil aerosols and alkalines or corrosion from acid compounds in the waste gas can effectively be avoided by the dosage of slaked lime. An other target of the project was the examination of PCDD/PCDF - emissions and their reduction by the fabric filter. Measurements in the <b>wind</b> <b>boxes</b> underneath the sinter strand lead to different dioxin profiles regarding the length of the sinter machine with a maximum in the last third of the length. Calculations based on the discoveries established by the princip of EOS a maximum circulation of 33 % of the waste gas, a reduction of the PCDD/F-concentration due to thermal destruction in the circulated waste gas and a load reduction by minimizing the waste gas stream. Tests about PCDD/F-reduction during the dosage of carbon additives were also carried out. Depending on the dose point and the sort of additive in single cases precipitation levels of more than 99 % were achieved. With the installed industrial dosage system reduction levels of 90 % were achieved. (orig.)

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a simulation software tool, GASFLO, which should evaluate pressure, flow and temperature distributions of process gas in pellet induration system networks. Pellet induration systems are complex industrial systems composed of heterogenous components. The magnitude of gas through leaks i. e. the air entering or leaving the system from the points other than the known exits, is substantial and it adversely effects the performance of induration process. These leaks are very difficult to measure because of the hostile environment in the plant. The modelling of such industrial systems requires a notable amount of experimentation so the tool has been designed to enable the user modeller to change the component models and solution algorithms easily. The conventional methods for flow network simulation are based on process centred approach, mostly composed of homogeneous components. For ease of computation, the non-pipe elements are modelled with an approximate linear or non-linear generic equation, whose coefficients can simulate different states of the element. The resulting set of non-linear equations is linearised and solved simultaneously using some iterative method. By contrast, GASFLO is based on device centred or unit based approach, and uses a two level hierarchical solution algorithm. The pellet induration system network is first idealised into a connected graph of streams (sets of serially connected components) and nodes. At the top or coordination level the flow and pressure distributions satisfying the Kirchhoff's laws are evaluated for the connected graph. At the lower or component level the exact mathematical models of components ale computed, in order of their occurrence in respective streams, using coordination variables as parameters. The converged flows are used for the temperature computation. The solution algorithm requires partitioning of the connected graph into forest and coforest structures, for which secondary algorithms have been developed using specific heuristics relevant to the pellet induration systems. The rigorous application of software engineering techniques for the design and implementation of software, enabled the resolution of the complexity of the modelled system, embedded the characteristics of 'quality software' into the resulting code and benefits from object orientation, even though it is implemented in standard FORTRAN 77. GASFLO predicted results are in a good agreement with the measured results, it has been validated for a real life pellet induration system. It has been applied to simulate several practical scenarios, like addition of extra <b>wind</b> <b>boxes</b> to the zones and to determine how the plant production can be increased by certain ratio, such simulations were not feasible otherwise. GASFLO takes less than a minute to simulate a real-life pellet induration system on a 486 PC. The combined simulation with an other software tool, INDSYS, which evaluates the heat distribution in the solids, is also feasible...|$|R

The wind turbine faults are mostly from the gear box, and the fault signal is generally nonlinear and nonstationary. The traditional fault diagnosis methods such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the inverted frequency spectrum identification method based on FFT are not satisfactory in processing this kind of signal. This paper proposes a hybrid fault diagnosis method which combines the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform. The vibration signal is analyzed through wavelet transform, and the aliasing in high-frequency signals is then addressed by conducting EMD to the original signals. The experimental results based on a specific <b>wind</b> turbine gear <b>box</b> demonstrate that this method can diagnose the faults and locate their positions accurately...|$|R
5000|$|A parts washer is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used to remove contaminants or debris, such as dirt, grime, carbon, oil, grease, metal chips, cutting fluids, mold release agents, ink, paint, and corrosion from workpieces. Parts washers are used in new manufacturing and remanufacturing processes; they are designed to clean, degrease and dry bulk loads of small or large parts in preparation for assembly, inspection, surface treatment, packaging and distribution. Parts washers may be as simple as the manual [...] "sink-on-a-drum" [...] common to many auto repair shops, or they may be very complex, multi-stage units with pass-through parts handling systems. Parts washers are essential in maintenance, repair and remanufacturing operations as well, from cleaning fasteners, nuts, bolts and screws to diesel engine blocks and related parts, rail bearings, <b>wind</b> turbine gears <b>boxes</b> and automotive assemblies.|$|R
