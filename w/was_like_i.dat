5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E

500|$|The sole Kenyan athlete at the Games, Philip Boit, {{competed in}} the men's 10 {{kilometre}} classical cross-country skiing. The competition took place on 12 February, at the Snow Harp venue in Hakuba, Nagano. The beginning of the race was chaotic, with the skiers beset by heavy rain. Boit {{was not prepared to}} race on wet snow, and later attributed it as the reason for falling down on several occasions. He found that it added further complications, adding [...] "Going uphill, the skis were collecting snow. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had put on high heeled-shoes!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Gore {{became a}} vegan. He had earlier {{admitted}} that [...] "it's absolutely correct that the growing meat intensity of diets {{across the world}} {{is one of the}} issues connected to this global crisis – {{not only because of the}} [...] involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process" [...] and some speculate that his adoption of the new diet is related to his environmentalist stance. In a 2014 interview, Gore said [...] "Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what it <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> ... <b>I</b> felt better, so I've continued with it and I'm likely to continue it for the rest of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|While Oasis' {{first two}} singles, [...] "Supersonic" [...] and [...] "Shakermaker", were {{modestly}} received, it was [...] "Live Forever" [...] that [...] "got the world's attention". [...] "Live Forever" [...] became Oasis' first top ten hit, reaching number ten on the British singles charts in 1994. In 1995, the song became the band's first chart {{success in the}} United States, reaching number two and ten on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively. Noel Gallagher commented on the praise given to the song: [...] "People said to me after 'Live Forever', 'Where are you gonna go after that?' And I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> don't think it's that good. I think it's a fucking good song, but I think I can do better." ...|$|E

500|$|After Mars' {{sister in}} Los Angeles played Mars' demo for Mike Lynn, (the A at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment), Lynn summoned [...] Mars to Los Angeles. In 2003, shortly {{after graduating from}} high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career. He adopted his stage name from the {{nickname}} his father gave him, adding [...] "Mars" [...] at the end because: [...] "I felt like I didn't have [...] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I’m out of this world, so I <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> guess I'm from Mars." [...] Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also due to [...] "the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latino artist, and even convinced him to sing in Spanish." ...|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E
500|$|The {{favourite}} for the race, Bjorn Daehlie of Norway won {{the gold}} medal, but {{instead of going to}} the podium to collect it, he was informed that Boit was still racing – the only competitor left on the course, down in 92nd place. Daehlie waited for Boit to finish, welcoming him as he passed the finish line. Boit was amazed by the crowd's reaction as he arrived, [...] "They were shouting 'Kenya GO!, Philip GO!' It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was winning a medal even though I was last." [...] As he crossed the line some 20 minutes after Daehlie, the Norwegian hugged the Kenyan – while Boit later said that he immediately thanked Daehlie, the gold medallist insisted that Boit instead remarked that he would beat him at the next Olympics. The incident received worldwide attention.|$|E

500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} Stanley Kubrick's {{death and}} the Columbine High School massacre occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing A Clockwork Orange, Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, {{he realized he was}} headed down the same path as the shooters. [...] "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was looking in the mirror and I didn't want the same fate for myself," [...] Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 grade point average and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] by his peers. He studied film at Emerson College and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.|$|E
500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened".

500|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was written}} by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and {{produced}} by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads.

You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone". She further said that she [...] "loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> don't think they {{going to like it}} because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it." [...] He expressed.|$|E
500|$|Oakley, Inc. {{provided}} the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized {{version of the}} company's own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection-moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, which looked remarkable, says Gordon Smith, {{but at the last}} minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added 6 hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. [...] There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, [...] "I had almost no contact {{with the rest of the}} cast; it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell." ...|$|E
