25|$|Ryder's fleet {{management}} business is its largest business segment, accounting for 71% {{of its revenue}} {{for a total of}} $4.4 billion. Profit of $398 million was 86% of the total. This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>go.</b> In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent. Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.|$|E
25|$|The easternmost county US-70 serves in Oklahoma is McCurtain County. The road heads southeast, {{passing through}} Valliant, before {{intersecting}} SH-98 west of Millerton. East of SH-98, US-70 bisects Millerton, then continues southeast through Garvin. It then reaches the county seat, Idabel; here, US-70 BYP heads {{along the west}} and southwest sides of the city, while mainline US-70 continues east across the northern reaches of the Idabel city limits. In {{the northeast corner of}} town, US-70 intersects US-259/SH-3, turning north to form a concurrency with them (with eastbound US-70 and westbound SH-3 overlapping to form a wrong-way concurrency). The highways proceed to Broken Bow, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> their separate ways; SH-3 turns west, US-259 continues north, and US-70 turns east. US-70 reaches the state line west of DeQueen, Arkansas; after crossing the line, it passes into Sevier County, Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely {{are able to}} just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. <b>Where</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E

[...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong."

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the now {{strained}} relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [...] and I have had some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it's picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There {{is a lot of}} interesting chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson's return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck between {{the two sides of the}} law. Jackson explained to The Huffington Post in 2009: [...] "I think my instincts towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke's son, and given Luke's ties to the mob, Lucky's seen the world from both sides. I don't think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray." [...] In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> with it. Lucky has been doing a lot of that straight cop stuff. I think if we can show the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: [...] "Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he's doing stuff like that. They've had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it'd be nice to pair them up." ...|$|E
