5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular enemies, the player also needs to defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; when this happens, the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk <b>with</b> <b>defense</b> and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, and Sage {{with an increase in}} the weapon limit gauge. Sometimes when enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory.|$|E

True 6×6 vehicles which have three powered axles, and are classified as 6×6s regardless of how many wheels they have.

The Arsenal Ship would be {{acquired}} as a prototype under DARPA's Other Transaction Authority under Section 845 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1994 (Public Law 103-160), which allowed them to bypass much of the bureaucracy involved <b>with</b> <b>defense</b> procurement, enabling a prototype to be built by the end of 2000. The requirement was for a network-capable ship with around 500 VLS and less than 50 personnel, for a cost of less than $520m for the lead ship. A further five ships would be acquired at a later date.|$|E
25|$|Master Sergeant Woodrow W. Keeble {{served with}} bravery and dignity, {{going beyond the}} call of duty not for notoriety or recognition-but for the mission he {{believed}} in and the country he loved. Keeble's legacy is a great source of pride for his family, his fellow Dakota Sioux, and all Americans. The Secretary of the Army's recommendation is wonderful and long-awaited news. I began working with Master Sergeant Keeble's family and tribal officials on resolving this long overdue issue in the spring of 2002, and I will continue to work <b>with</b> <b>Defense</b> officials to ensure that this legendary soldier receives the final and most distinguished honor he deserves.|$|E

500|$|Zacharias {{states that}} a {{coherent}} worldview {{must be able}} to satisfactorily answer four questions: that of origin, meaning of life, morality and destiny. He says that while every major religion makes exclusive claims about truth, the Christian faith is unique in its ability to answer all four of these questions. He routinely speaks on the coherence of the Christian worldview, saying that Christianity is capable of withstanding the toughest philosophical attacks. Zacharias believes that the apologist must argue from three levels: the theoretical, to line up the logic of the argument; the arts, to illustrate; and [...] "kitchen table talk", to conclude and apply. [...] Zacharias' style of apologetic focuses predominantly on Christianity's answers to life's great existential questions, <b>with</b> <b>defense</b> of God.|$|E
500|$|In his own writings, Abu-Jamal {{describes}} his adolescent {{experience of being}} [...] "kicked... into the Black Panther Party" [...] after suffering a beating from [...] "white racists" [...] and a policeman for his efforts to disrupt a George Wallace for President rally in 1968. From the age of 14, he helped form the Philadelphia branch of the Black Panther Party <b>with</b> <b>Defense</b> Captain Reggie Schell, and other Panthers. He was appointed as the chapter's [...] "Lieutenant of Information," [...] responsible for writing information and news communications. In an interview in the early years, Abu-Jamal quoted Mao Zedong, saying that [...] "political power grows out of {{the barrel of a}} gun". That same year, he dropped out of Benjamin Franklin High School and began living at the branch's headquarters.|$|E
500|$|On September 25, 1994, Gardner {{got drunk}} from {{consuming}} alcohol, which he fermented {{in his own}} prison cell sink, and stabbed inmate Richard [...] "Fats" [...] Thomas with a shiv fashioned {{from a pair of}} sunglasses. Thomas suffered nine puncture wounds to his face, mouth, arm and chest that were life-threatening, but made a full recovery. Though Thomas had survived the stabbing, Gardner was charged with another capital crime under a 1974 Utah law reserved for prison attacks by first-degree felony inmates. There was no precedent in the United States for a death penalty that was carried out for such a crime. The constitutionality of the law was challenged, <b>with</b> <b>defense</b> lawyers calling it [...] "stale and anachronistic," [...] and the charge against Gardner was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim did not die.|$|E

DotA: Allstars by Steve Feak was the most successful, and Feak, with his friend Steve Mescon, created the official Defense of the Ancients community website and the holding company DotA-Allstars, LLC. When Feak retired from DotA: Allstars in 2005, a friend, under the pseudonym [...] "IceFrog", became its lead designer. By the late 2000s, Defense of the Ancients {{became one of the}} most popular mods in the world, as well as a prominent eSports title.
