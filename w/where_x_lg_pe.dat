40|$|The plant cuticle {{consists}} of aliphatic wax and cutin, and covers all the aerial tissues, conferring resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we performed phenotypic characterizations of tomato mutants having both sticky peel (pe) and light green (lg) mutations. Our genetic {{analysis showed that}} these two mutations are tightly linked and behave like a monogenic recessive mutation. The double mutant (<b>pe</b> <b>lg)</b> produced glossy soft fruits with light green leaves, most likely due to defects in cuticle formation. Cytological analysis revealed that {{the thickness of the}} fruit cuticle layer was dramatically reduced in the <b>pe</b> <b>lg</b> mutant. The epidermal cells of the leaves were also deformed in the <b>pe</b> <b>lg</b> mutant, suggesting that leaf cuticle formation was also disrupted in the mutant. Consistent with this, transmission electron microscopic analysis showed that the electron density of the cuticle layer of the adaxial surface of the leaf was reduced in the <b>pe</b> <b>lg</b> mutant compared to WT, suggesting that there are changes in cuticle structure and/or composition in the <b>pe</b> <b>lg</b> mutant. Both physiological analysis to measure the rate of transpiration, and staining of the fruits and leaves with toluidine blue, revealed that water permeability was enhanced in the <b>pe</b> <b>lg</b> mutant, consistent with the reduced thickness of its cuticle layer. Taken together the preliminary analyses of the cuticle components, the <b>PE</b> <b>LG</b> is most likely involved in proper cuticle formation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical validity of two exchange ratio determination models for merger, the Larson and Gonedes (<b>LG)</b> <b>PE</b> {{model and the}} Yagil dividend growth model. These two models formulate exchange ratios {{as a function of}} a different factor: expected post-merger price-earnings multiple and expected post-merger dividend growth, respectively. While the LG model has been tested in previous studies, the Yagil model has yet been subject to empirical testing. This paper finds empirical support for the LG model but finds weak support for the Yagil model. In particular, the results show that the number of stock mergers that result in wealth gains for both acquiring and target firms and hence conform to the rationality assumption of each model is substantially greater for the LG model than for the Yagil model. Regression analysis provides confirmatory evidence on the empirical validity of the LG model that PE-related variables play a more significant role in explaining the actual exchange ratios than growth-related variables.

40|$|The genetic {{improvement}} of soybean (Glycine max (L.)) cultivars in North America (N. A.) has, {{for the most}} part, been accomplished by intermating elite cultivars. This breeding strategy, combined with the limited N. A. genetic base, {{has resulted in a}} very narrow gene pool. Plant introductions (PI) have been used to expand the N. A. genetic base with limited success when conventional breeding methods have been used. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping has been used to identify genetic regions within PIs that could contribute both genetic diversity and improved seed yield potential in the N. A. gene pool. Of the putative QTL for seed yield that have been identified, only a small percentage have been tested in confirmation trials and even fewer have been confirmed. The objective {{of this study is to}} confirm putative QTL for seed yield derived from Exotic germplasm that were identified in previous QTL mapping studies. One BC 1 F 9 confirmation population was developed from the cross Kenwood <b>x</b> <b>LG</b> 94 - 1713 to test the QTL associated with SSR loci Satt 405 (linkage group (LG), J chromosome (chr) 16) and two BC 1 F 11 populations were developed to test Satt 477 (LG O, chr 10) and Satt 557 (LG C 2, chr 6). Four F 8 confirmation populations were developed from the cross of BSR 101 <b>x</b> <b>LG</b> 82 - 8379 to test the QTL linked to Satt 142 (LG H, chr 12), Satt 225 (LG A 1, chr 5), Satt 363 (LG C 2, chr 6), and Satt 544 (LG K, chr 9) and two F 9 populations were developed to test Satt 168 (LG B 2, chr 14) and Satt 358 (LG O, chr 10). Unfortunately, no putative QTL for seed yield were confirmed in any of the populations developed from the BSR 101 <b>x</b> <b>LG</b> 82 - 8379 mapping population. A QTL for plant height, maturity, and seed yield associated with Satt 557 was confirmed in two populations developed from Kenwood <b>x</b> <b>LG</b> 94 - 1713 with the beneficial allele coming from the LG 94 - 1713 parent but these results were confounded by the tight linkage of Satt 557 to the E 1 locus. In both populations maturity was delayed by slightly more than 5 days in the lines homozygous for the LG 94 - 1713 allele. However, there were differences between the two populations for both plant height and seed yield. The allele from LG 94 - 1713 in one population increased plant height by 4. 6 cm and seed yield by 0. 32 Mg ha- 1 more than in the second population. We hypothesize that a crossover occurred in one of the populations that separated the putative QTL from Satt 557 but not from E 1 and this QTL is responsible for the increase in seed yield and plant height. Several polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have been identified between the two parents, which are on either side of Satt 557. The lines in both populations are being tested with these markers to determine if and where the crossover occurred. If our assumption is correct, this confirmed QTL for seed yield may add additional genetic diversity and higher seed yield potential to the N. A. gene pool...|$|R

Recent studies have asked when, for αX ∈ K(X), the {{restriction}} homomorphism ρ: C(αX) → C(X) is an epimorphism {{in the category}} of commutative rings. This article continues this study by examining the sub-semilattice, Kepi(X), of those compactifications where ρ is an epimorphism along with two of its subsets, and its complement Knepi(X). The role of Kz(X) ⊆ K(X) of those αX <b>where</b> <b>X</b> is z-embedded in αX, is also examined.
