60|$|She came {{round with}} a {{thrashing}} of canvas, stretched out seawards, {{and came back}} again with her deck sharply slanted and little puffs of bitter spray blowing over her <b>weather</b> <b>rail,</b> for {{there was no doubt}} that the breeze was freshening fast. Then Dampier sent a man up into the foremast shrouds, and looked at Wyllard afterwards.|$|E
60|$|Desmond disregarded him, and {{staggering}} {{clear of}} the deck-house stood with feet spread well apart gazing at the stretch of leaden sea while, as the Palestrina's bows went up, the spray that whirled in over her <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> wet him to the skin. He saw the livid tops of the combers that rolled by the point and heard the jarring cables ring, and then turned his eyes shorewards and gazed across the waste of misty littoral.|$|E
60|$|The {{fisherman}} and his boy took {{turn and}} turn, one steering {{and the other}} keeping a look-out forward and trimming the sails. The two passengers crouched huddled together against the <b>weather</b> <b>rail.</b> They were each too occupied with thought to have time for speech. Suddenly, after passing Claxton and rounding the point, they came in full sight of the Priory, every window of which was blazing with light. They could see dark figures passing to and fro against the glare.|$|E
50|$|When {{installing}} new rail, {{or before}} {{the onset of}} hot <b>weather,</b> the <b>rail</b> is pulled or stretched by hydraulic tensors or heated along its entire length to an equivalent length to that which the rail would be at 27 Â°C (in the UK), which is known as the Stress Free temperature.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{part of the}} M.C.Davies Timber railway system, {{which ran}} between the two jetties at Hamelin Bay and Flinders Bay (supposedly {{to be able to}} load timber {{regardless}} of the prevailing <b>weather).</b> The <b>rails</b> were light and the line was poorly constructed, and oriented towards rough workings of the timber railway system.|$|R
50|$|In severe <b>weather,</b> airlines, <b>rail</b> service providers, bus operators, {{and other}} public {{transport}} may cancel or reduce services. Route impassability, airport closure, employees' safety, and public safety may result in such action. However, some modes of transport {{are more prone to}} severe weather than others, and different forms of bad weather have different impacts.|$|R
60|$|A {{dull and}} inexpressive murmur was {{heard from the}} men. Over the high <b>weather</b> <b>rail,</b> a topping wave flung into their eyes a handful of heavy drops that stung like hail. There were low groans of indignation. A man sighed. Another emitted a spasmodic laugh through his {{chattering}} teeth. No one moved away. The little kassab wiped his face and went on in his cracked voice, {{to the accompaniment of}} the swishing sounds made by the seas that swept regularly astern along the ship's side.|$|E
60|$|Up to {{his knees}} in water, Wyllard {{staggered}} after him and made out by the mad banging that some one had already cast {{the peak of the}} boom-foresail loose. He reached the windlass, and clutched it, as a sea that took him to the waist frothed in over the <b>weather</b> <b>rail.</b> The bows lurched out of it viciously, hurling another icy flood back on him, and he could see a dim white chaos of frothing water about and beneath them. Above rose the black wedge of the jibs.|$|E
60|$|It {{was three}} in the morning when his unseamanlike conduct precipitated the catastrophe. At sight of a sea far larger than its fellows, he {{crouched}} down, releasing his hands from the spokes. The Francis Spaight sheered as her stern lifted on the sea, receiving the full fling of the cap on her quarter. The next instant she was in the trough, her lee-rail buried till the ocean was level with her hatch-coamings, sea after sea breaking over her <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> and sweeping what remained exposed of the deck with icy deluges.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{majority}} of the literature had originally studied the effects of weather on transport in the road sector, much focus has recently also been placed on the study of the effects of <b>weather</b> on <b>rail</b> transport. In this section, a review of weather-related studies of railway traffic is presented first. The studies in both categories are sorted from the newest to the oldest. We then focus on the Norwegian railway and how this study is related to recent punctuality research in Norway.|$|R
50|$|A {{special case}} is heat related buckling: in hot <b>weather</b> the <b>rail</b> steel expands. This is managed by {{stressing}} continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral {{at a moderate}} temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).|$|R
25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold <b>weather</b> the <b>rails</b> try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit like a piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} the cruelty of the sea, its relentlessness and awfulness, rushed upon me. Life had become cheap and tawdry, a beastly and inarticulate thing, a soulless {{stirring}} of the ooze and slime. I held on to the <b>weather</b> <b>rail,</b> close by the shrouds, and gazed out across the desolate foaming waves to the low-lying fog-banks that hid San Francisco and the California coast. Rain-squalls were driving in between, and I could scarcely see the fog. And this strange vessel, with its terrible men, pressed under by wind and sea and ever leaping up and out, was heading away into the south-west, into the great and lonely Pacific expanse.|$|E
60|$|While Maud {{was passing}} me the {{provisions}} and I was storing {{them in the}} boat, a sailor came on deck from the forecastle. He stood by the <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> for a time (we were lowering over the lee rail), and then sauntered slowly amidships, where he again paused and stood facing the wind, with his back toward us. I could hear my heart beating as I crouched low in the boat. Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was, I knew, lying motionless, her body {{in the shadow of}} the bulwark. But the man never turned, and, after stretching his arms above his head and yawning audibly, he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{with a quick}} double report, as {{of heavy}} guns, both topsails filled at once and the brig fell over swiftly on her side. Shaw was thrown headlong against the skylight, and Lingard, who had encircled the <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> with his arm, felt the vessel under his feet dart forward smoothly, and the deck become less slanting--the speed of the brig running off a little now, easing the {{overturning}} strain of the wind upon the distended surfaces of the sails. It was only the fineness of the little vessel's lines and the perfect shape of her hull that saved the canvas, and perhaps the spars, by enabling the ready craft to get way upon herself with such lightning-like rapidity. Lingard drew a long breath and yelled jubilantly at Shaw who was struggling up against wind and rain to his commander's side.|$|E
50|$|The first street tramways {{were laid}} in 1832 in New York by John Stephenson to assist horses pulling buses on dirt roads, {{especially}} when the roads were muddy from wet <b>weather.</b> The <b>rails</b> enabled a horse to easily pull a load of 10 tonnes compared to 1 tonne on a dirt road. The evolution of street tramway tracks paralleled the transition from horse power to mechanical and electric power. In a dirt road, the rails needed a foundation, usually a mass concrete raft. Highway authorities often made tramway companies pave {{the rest of the}} road, usually with granite or similar stone blocks, at extra cost.|$|R
40|$|Extreme winters have {{repeatedly}} led to severely disrupted situations on the Dutch railway network. Due to heavy snow and ice, both infrastructure and rolling stock broke down or malfunctioned, {{which made the}} network run out-of-control. Today, a special reduced timetable is being deployed to provide for more robustness and consequently limit the impact of winter <b>weather</b> on the <b>rail</b> operations. This timetable is, however, structurally unable to transport all passengers to their destination. This thesis explores alternative line systems for a winter timetable, aiming to increase the transport capacity while maintaining robustness.

50|$|Owners of the Phillips and Rangeley Railroad (P&R) {{were most}} {{interested}} in a means of transporting lumber to markets from the aboriginal spruce forests of Redington township. Redington Lumber Company owned 375 of the 400 shares of P&R stock sold. Construction began where the Sandy River Railroad ended in Phillips; and the first train reached Redington on 11 October 1890. After leaving Reeds Mills, the railroad climbed 800 feet up nine roadless miles of Orbeton Stream canyon between Saddleback Mountain and Mount Abraham. Redington sawmill was built near the summit of {{what came to be}} called Sluice Hill. Although no station buildings had been constructed, the P&R commenced regular train service to Redington {{a few days before the}} mill started producing lumber on 21 February 1891. Frozen ground halted construction for the winter, but spring <b>weather</b> brought <b>rails</b> to Rangeley on 10 June 1891. On 1 July 1891, scheduled train service commenced from Rangeley to the Maine Central Railroad in Farmington via the Sandy River Railroad from Phillips.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a dreary}} enough day, no sun, with {{occasional}} splatters {{of rain and}} a persistent crash of seas over the <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> and swash of water across the deck. With my eyes glued to the cabin ports, which gave for'ard along the main deck, I could see the wretched sailors, whenever they were given some task of pull and haul, wet through and through by the boarding seas. Several times I saw some of them taken off their feet and rolled about in the creaming foam. And yet, erect, unstaggering, with certitude of weight and strength, among these rolled men, these clutching, cowering ones, moved either Mr. Pike or Mr. Mellaire. They were never taken off their feet. They never shrank away from a splash of spray or heavier bulk of down-falling water. They had fed on different food, were informed with a different spirit, were of iron {{in contrast with the}} poor miserables they drove to their bidding.|$|E
60|$|They hauled it down; but the Tyee, being loaded deep {{with heavy}} machinery, was not appreciably drier afterward, {{and by the}} time the angry, saffron sunset faded off the foam-crested sea, she put her bows in {{somewhat}} frequently. Then there was a thud as she charged a big comber, and the frothy cataract that seethed in over her <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> swirled aft a foot deep, while the spray blew all over her. Jimmy, buttoned to the throat in oilskins, stood at her wheel dripping, through four hours of darkness; and then, crawling down into the little cabin, which was intolerably foul, flung himself into his bunk and incontinently fell asleep, with the thud and swish of falling water going on above him. When he awakened, his first proceeding was to grope for the button that would summon a steward boy to bring him his morning coffee, but as he could not find it he looked around and saw his wet oilskins, which had shaken off the hook, sliding amidst the water up and down the Tyee's cabin floor. Then he remembered suddenly, and, dropping from his bunk, put on the oilskins and went up on deck.|$|E
60|$|How {{he first}} {{got in touch}} with his captain's wife Powell relates in this way. It was long before his memorable {{conversation}} with the mate and shortly after getting clear of the channel. It was gloomy weather; dead head wind, blowing quite half a gale; the Ferndale under reduced sail was stretching close-hauled across the track of the homeward bound ships, just moving through the water and no more, since there was no object in pressing her and the weather looked threatening. About ten o'clock at night he was alone on the poop, in charge, keeping well aft by the <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> and staring to windward, when amongst the white, breaking seas, under the black sky, he made out the lights of a ship. He watched them for some time. She was running dead before the wind of course. She will pass jolly close--he said to himself; and then suddenly he felt a great mistrust of that approaching ship. She's heading straight for us--he thought. It was not his business {{to get out of the}} way. On the contrary. And his uneasiness grew by the recollection of the forty tons of dynamite in the body of the Ferndale; not the sort of cargo one thinks of with equanimity in connection with a threatened collision. He gazed at the two small lights in the dark immensity filled with the angry noise of the seas. They fascinated him till their plainness to his sight gave him a conviction that there was danger there. He knew in his mind what to do in the emergency, but very properly he felt that he must call the captain out at once.|$|E
40|$|Railway track {{buckling}} occurs due to inadequate rail stress adjustment. Stress alterations {{are greatly}} influenced by the variation in rail temperature due to weather fluctuations. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to describe a 24 hour rail temperature prediction model which was developed for use in rail operations to assist in predicting adverse rail temperature conditions which could lead to or initiate track buckling. By applying predictive information, trains can be directed to travel at a regulated speed to reduce the longitudinal loading on the track. The model uses multivariate linear regression to predict the rail temperatures from the predicted weather forecast. Data from a field experiment, involving a <b>weather</b> station and <b>rail</b> temperature sensors, was statistically evaluated and compared to determine the accuracy of the rail temperature model. This paper evaluates the accuracy of i) rail temperatures predicted using only Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) <b>weather</b> forecasts ii) <b>rail</b> temperature predictions using on site weather station data, and iii) empirical weather prediction equations. Concluding results of this paper show that rail temperature can be predicted 24 hour in advance from a BoM forecasts and if calibrated properly the accuracy is within +/- 2. 6 ÂºC of actual rail temperatures. Real time rail temperature predictions using on site weather station data have an accuracy of +/- 4. 2 ÂºC; whereas empirical methods have at most an accuracy of +/- 5. 9 ÂºC from actual rail temperatures. The accuracy of the forecasted rail temperature prediction using BoM weather forecasts is within the magnitude of temperature sensors accuracies this is very encouraging for possibility of rail forecasting rail temperatures without the use of instrumentation...|$|R
6000|$|The {{particular}} {{rules in}} the book which affected our engine-driver were uncommonly stringent, and very properly so, seeing that the lives of so many persons depended on the constancy of his coolness, courage, and vigilance. John Marrot, like all the engine-drivers on the line, was a picked man. In virtue of his superior character and abilities he received wages {{to the extent of}} 2 pounds, 10 shillings per week. Among other things, he was enjoined by his [...] "rules and regulations," [...] very strictly, to give a loud whistle before starting, to start his train slowly and without a jerk, and to take his orders to start only from the guard; also, to approach stations or stopping places cautiously, and with the train well under control, and to be guided in the matter of shutting off steam, by such considerations as the number of vehicles in the train, and the state of the <b>weather</b> and <b>rails,</b> so as to avoid violent application of the brakes. Moreover, he was bound to do his best to keep to his exact time, and to account for any loss thereof by entering the cause of delay on his report-ticket. He was also earnestly enjoined to use every effort which might conduce to the safety of the public, and was authorised to refuse to proceed with any carriage or waggon which, from hot axles or otherwise, was in his opinion unfit to run. These are but a few specimens culled from a multitude of rules bearing on the minutest details of his duty as to driving, shunting, signalling, junction and level crossing, etcetera, with all of which he had to become not merely acquainted, but so intimately familiar that his mind could grasp them collectively, relatively, or individually at any moment, so as to act instantaneously, yet coolly, while going like a giant bomb-shell through the air--with human lives in the balance to add weight to his responsibilities.|$|R

Nice looking little fellow, he was. I had just been thinking we would be great chums. However, that wasn't yet the worst that brute of a ship could do. I served in her three years of my time, and then I got transferred to the Lucy Apse, for a year. The sailmaker {{we had in the}} Apse Family turned up there, too, and I remember him saying to me one evening, after we had been a week at sea: Isn't she a meek little ship?' No wonder we thought the Lucy Apse a dear, meek, little ship after getting clear of that big, rampaging savage brute. It was like heaven. Her officers seemed to me the restfullest lot of men on earth. To me who had known no ship but the Apse Family, the Lucy was like a sort of magic craft that did what you wanted her to do of her own accord. One evening we got caught aback pretty sharply from right ahead. In about ten minutes we had her full again, sheets aft, tacks down, decks cleared, and the officer of the watch leaning against the <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> peacefully. It seemed simply marvellous to me. The other would have stuck for half-an-hour in irons, rolling her decks full of water, knocking the men about--spars cracking, braces snapping, yards taking charge, and a confounded scare going on aft because of her beastly rudder, which she had a way of flapping about fit to raise your hair on end. I couldn't get over my wonder for days.|$|E
6000|$|No sooner {{does the}} wind ease than the sea picks up. The combers are {{breaking}} now, {{and the boat}} is tossing like a cork. Then out of the blackness the gusts come harder and faster than before. If only I knew what was up there to windward in the blackness! The Snark is making heavy weather of it, and her lee-rail is buried oftener than not. More shrieks and snorts of wind. Now, if ever, {{is the time to}} call the men. I WILL call them, I resolve. Then there is a burst of rain, a slackening of the wind, and I do not call. But it is rather lonely, there at the wheel, steering a little world through howling blackness. It is quite a responsibility to be all alone on the surface of a little world in time of stress, doing the thinking for its sleeping inhabitants. I recoil from the responsibility as more gusts begin to strike and as a sea licks along the <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> and splashes over into the cockpit. The salt water seems strangely warm to my body and is shot through with ghostly nodules of phosphorescent light. I shall surely call all hands to shorten sail. Why should they sleep? I am a fool to have any compunctions in the matter. My intellect is arrayed against my heart. It was my heart that said, [...] "Let them sleep." [...] Yes, but it was my intellect that backed up my heart in that judgment. Let my intellect then reverse the judgment; and, while I am speculating as to what particular entity issued that command to my intellect, the gusts die away. Solicitude for mere bodily comfort has no place in practical seamanship, I conclude sagely; but study the feel of the next series of gusts and do not call the men. After all, it IS my intellect, behind everything, procrastinating, measuring its knowledge of what the Snark can endure against the blows being struck at her, and waiting the call of all hands against the striking of still severer blows.|$|E

40|$|Preventing track {{buckling}} {{is important}} to the railroad industryâs goal of operational safety. It is a common practice for railroads to impose slow orders during hot weather when the risk of track buckling is high. Numerous factors affect track buckling, but the instantaneous rail temperatures and stress-free (neutral) rail temperatures are the most critical factors. Unfortunately, neither of these two temperatures is easily obtainable. Decisions for slow orders are often based on an arbitrary, ambient temperature limit. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development has initiated a research project to develop a model for predicting rail temperatures based on real-time meteorological forecast data. The rail temperature prediction model is based on the heat transfer process of a rail exposed to the sun. In developing such a model, a rail-weather station was established, composed of a portable weather station and a short segment of rail track with temperature sensors installed on both rails. The model has proven to be able to predict the maximum rail temperature within a few degrees and within 30 minutes of the actual time when the maximum rail temperature occurs during the day. The model is being validated for three locations where real-time <b>weather</b> data and <b>rail</b> temperature are collected. A prototype webbase...|$|R

40|$|Railways {{all over}} the world suffer from track buckles caused by {{variations}} in thermal stresses arising from temperature fluctuations due to climate. Notable studies during the 1960 s to 1980 s include Kerr, Samavedam and Kish from the Volpe Centre in the United States, Esveld from the European Railway Research Institute and Hagaman and Kathage for the Railways of Australia (ROA). Buckling and trackparameters which contribute to track instabilities have been studied and characterised comprehensively during those years. From the 1990 s, track lateral stability studies have focused on risk analysis andmanagement procedures probabilistically using software such as CWR-SAFE. Recently buckling research has been on forecasting rail temperatures. Two notable rail temperature prediction models have beendeveloped by Chapman et al. with the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board, Zhang and Lee from Ensco Inc, and Federal Railroad Administration in the United States. An advanced predictive model like that developed by Chapman for rail temperature signifies for industry the difference between blanket speed restriction procedures and focused operational management based on localised risk conditions determined using a scientific approach. This paper gives a comparative review on the models developed by Chapman et al and Zhang and Lee, and what knowledge is currently available in Australia including studies by Whittingham and, more recently, Munro. It also outlines the steps that the Australian rail industry needs to take to further develop a comprehensive track stability management system. Collating existing knowledge is the first step for the Australian railway industry to have a more compreehnsive hot <b>weather</b> <b>rail</b> management policy...|$|E
