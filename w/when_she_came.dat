5|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> {{to serve}} in the Royal Navy, Agincourt was {{considered}} a particularly comfortable ship and very well-appointed internally. A knowledge of Portuguese was necessary to work many of the fittings—including those in the heads—as the original instruction plates had not all been replaced when she was taken over by the British. In 1917, her crew numbered 1,268 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She {{went out to}} the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|With {{national}} stability secured, Richard began {{negotiating a}} permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded {{the territory of}} Aquitaine possessed by the English crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay homage to the King of Francea condition that proved unacceptable to the English public. Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years. As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry Isabella, daughter of Charles VI of France, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular because the princess was then only six years old, and thus {{would not be able}} to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years.|$|E
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions.

Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E
