2500|$|After Sledge {{and others}} {{went to see}} a nearby {{airplane}} crash, [...] "hen <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our area, Corporal Doherty delivered one of his finest orations on the subject of recruits never leaving their assigned area without the permission of their DI. We were all impressed, particularly with the tremendous number of push-ups and other exercises we performed instead of going to noon chow". He wrote: ...|$|E

[...] "We used to smoke dope from {{when we got}} out of bed to when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bed," [...] recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: [...] "You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes out of your ears." [...] Joyce said the band even replaced the studio's light bulbs with red ones for [...]|$|E
2500|$|When he was 16, {{and still}} in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish {{children}} in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then {{became aware of the}} possibility of writing his own songs. [...] "And the next thing, I got a guitar when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs," [...] he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the [...] "first real interest" [...] he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful [...] "frustrations".|$|E
6000|$|When <b>we</b> had all <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> earth {{again in}} our various ways, Mr. Trelawny, holding his daughter's hand in his, {{went on with}} his discourse: ...|$|R
60|$|How we {{longed for}} the light and heat of a blazing fire when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back!</b> But, <b>to</b> the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was {{immediately}} surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.|$|R
6000|$|There was but {{one thing}} Maisie wished to do, and after an instant she {{expressed}} it. [...] "Have <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel?" ...|$|R
60|$|After <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} and Klein had gone, Silver jumps at me and waves his hands.|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our quarters, {{which we}} did without accident, Curtis asked me jocularly what I was {{thinking}} about.|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel, {{along came}} Rectus and Corny. They {{had been out}} walking together, and looked hot.|$|E
60|$|After <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Toll House, the Jews {{were not}} long of {{striking}} forward. But I observed {{that one of}} the Hanson lads came down, before their departure, and returned with a ship's kettle. Happy Hansons! Nor was it until after Kelmar was gone, if I remember rightly, that Rufe put in an appearance to arrange the details of our installation.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 February 2010, it was {{announced}} that Dan McBean and Andrew Sweeney had left the band, with Peters noting, [...] "No arguments or disagreements prompted anyone to leave, but when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> together <b>to</b> play after Three Fact Fader was released it was clear we had all moved on personally and professionally." [...] Shortly thereafter, it {{was announced}} that Phipps and Peters would continue with a new line-up, and musicians Ulrich Schnauss, Daniel Land (of the band Daniel Land & The Modern Painters), and Matthew Linley (of the band Gilbert) were added to the official line-up.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{recording}} Book Burner, Pig Destroyer {{built their}} own studio, Visceral Sound. As Blake Harrison, who plays electronic instruments for the band, explained, the band [...] "all {{had a hand}} in building it" [...] after getting kicked out of their practice space (a basement in former drummer Brian Harvey's parents' house) several years earlier. Scott Hull explained that the time spent building and moving into a new studio, which also served as the band's new practice space, attracted [...] "a big liability of falling into a kind of a slump. So when <b>we</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where <b>we</b> were practicing in the new place, we were out of practice, trying <b>to</b> get <b>back</b> into fighting shape for new material, let alone the old setlist material. It was very laborious. It felt like we were dragging an anchor behind us the whole time".|$|R

6000|$|The {{sands of}} the hour had all run out when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Temeraire. Says Bullfinch, then, to the youth in livery, with boldness, 'Lavatory!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was already}} evening when, having cut {{as much of}} the best meat as we could carry from the bull, and tied a red {{handkerchief}} and some tufts of grass to his spiral horns, which, by the way, must have been nearly five feet in length, in the hope of keeping the jackals and aasvögels (vultures) from him, <b>we</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp, to find Pharaoh, who was getting rather anxious at our absence, ready to greet us with the pleasing intelligence that another ox was sick. But even this dreadful bit of intelligence could not dash Harry's spirits; {{the fact of the matter}} being, incredible as it may appear, I do verily believe that in his heart of hearts he set down the death of the koodoo to the credit of his own skill. Now, though the lad was a pretty shot enough, this of course was ridiculous, and I told him so plainly.|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} so sure of this. Ghosts were unchancy folk, {{even if they were}} our family ghosts. The Story Girl had made the tale very real to us. We were glad we had not heard it in the evening. How could <b>we</b> ever have <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house through the shadows and swaying {{branches}} of a darkening orchard? As it was, we were almost afraid to look up it, lest we should see the waiting, blue-clad Emily under Uncle Alec's tree. But all we saw was Felicity, tearing over the green sward, her curls streaming behind her in a golden cloud.|$|R
5000|$|Oh {{has used}} {{helicopters}} to travel between base camps, and employed teams {{to prepare for}} her ascents in advance. She is under the sponsorship of Black Yak, a South Korean outdoor product maker. [...] She has been nicknamed [...] "Iron Woman" [...] and [...] "Squirrel" [...] for her climbing accomplishments. [...] Oh was criticized for failing {{to come to the}} aid of ailing Spanish climber Tolo Calafat, who died on Annapurna while waiting for help. [...] Oh responded that she was unaware that Calafat was sick until after she had descended and was no longer able to help. [...] "We reached the summit around 3 p.m. and the Spanish climber got there an hour later. By the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> down <b>to</b> Camp 4 we were all exhausted," [...] Oh said, adding that she [...] "really wanted" [...] to help but was [...] "not in a state to climb seven hours back up the slopes and rescue him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speaking about a party," [...] {{observed}} Songbird, as {{they approached}} the village, [...] "do you realize that we haven't had any sort of a feast at the Hall since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the grind?" ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the chamber}} we found Hutcheson still {{opposite}} the Iron Virgin; {{he had been}} evidently philosophising, and now gave us the benefit of his thought {{in the shape of}} a sort of exordium.|$|E
60|$|But alas! the joy did not last. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} from a stroll around the cliffs, the same old routine of {{yesterday}} was resumed: gloom and anxiety, hope, high spirits, deep depression, and apathetic aloofness.|$|E
5000|$|In August, Lava Man {{entered the}} Pacific Classic {{in which he}} led {{for most of the}} race but was caught near the wire and {{finished}} third. Despite the loss, O'Neill considered the race one of his finest efforts. [...] "He just laid his body down - what a huge race", said O'Neill. [...] "He was just rubber-legged, like a boxer, just no legs. He was okay. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the barn, <b>got</b> him drinking, got a hose on him right away, and he finally came to. But you don't see many horses run that hard to where they’re rubber-legged. They usually stop miles before that happens." [...] Lava Man was so exhausted he had to be vanned off the racetrack. [...] "He gave us such a scare," [...] said O'Neill. [...] "We thought he broke down. You wanted to hug the horse even more. He gave everything he had. People don't do that and horses don't do that." ...|$|R

I thought he was dead, for by the starlight I see he was bleedin' awful,--hold on, my dear, hold on to me,--he warn't, thank God, and looked up at me and sez, sez he, 'Are they safe?' 'They be, Captain,' sez I. 'Then it's all right,' sez he, smilin' in that bright way of his, and then dropped off as quiet as a lamb. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp double quick, and when the surgeon see them three wounds he shook his head, and I mistrusted that it warn't no joke. So when the Captain come to I asked him what I could do or git for him, and he {{answered}} in a whisper, 'My wife.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly there arose {{the most}} fearful hubbub, and <b>we</b> four <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back,</b> Alphonse dodging frantically round our little circle in his {{attempts}} to take shelter under our legs. We all had our revolvers on -- for though we had been politely disarmed of our guns on leaving the palace, of course these people {{did not know what}} a revolver was. Umslopogaas, too, had his axe, of which no effort had been made to deprive him, and now he whirled it round his head and sent his piercing Zulu war-shout echoing up the marble walls in fine defiant fashion. Next second, the priests, baffled of their prey, had drawn swords from beneath their white robes and were leaping on us like hounds upon a stag at bay. I saw that, dangerous as action might be, we must act or be lost, so as the first man came bounding along -- and a great tall fellow he was -- I sent a heavy revolver ball through him, and down he fell {{at the mouth of the}} shaft, and slid, shrieking frantically, into the fiery gulf that had been prepared for us.|$|R
6000|$|So when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{our hotel}} after the baths that afternoon, the {{concierge}} greeted us with: 'Well, your noble nephew has arrived, high-well-born countess!

60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel, King Arthur's Round Table {{was ready}} for us in its white drapery, and the head waiter and his first assistant, in swallow-tails and white cravats, brought in the soup and the hot plates at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are not," [...] {{the chief}} said. [...] "If you took {{all we have}} {{it would not be}} {{sufficient}} and, without our animals, we should starve when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hills; but I will pay twice the amount previously demanded." ...|$|E
5000|$|Within a week, however, {{support for}} MoveOn had grown. Blades calls herself an [...] "accidental activist. ... We put {{together}} a one-sentence petition. ... We sent it to under a hundred of our friends and family, and within a week we had a hundred thousand people sign the petition. At that point, {{we thought it was}} going to be a flash campaign, that we would help everyone connect with leadership in all the ways we could figure out, and then get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our regular lives. A half a million people ultimately signed and <b>we</b> somehow never <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our regular lives." [...] http://www.alternet.org/story/19043 MoveOn also recruited 2,000 volunteers to deliver the petitions in person to members of the House of Representatives in 219 districts across America, and directed 30,000 phone calls to district offices. http://archive.salon.com/21st/log/1998/10/27log.html ...|$|R

5000|$|Reflecting on {{the album}} in a 2016 {{interview}} with Alternative Press, guitarist Ben Bruce commented on the significant change in atmosphere upon recording their newest record, The Black, in comparison to From Death to Destiny, stating he felt the band were [...] "in a different mindset than we were for From Death To Destiny. Danny clearly didn’t {{want to be in}} the band and it was just a struggle the whole time. On From Death To Destiny, Danny just flat out refused to sing or scream over the songs we would write, so we had to make some huge compromises with that record. The Black <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our roots. It was a lot of fun doing Black." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York {{there was}} General Rompiro {{waiting for us}} on the pier. He was dancing like a {{cinnamon}} bear, all impatient for the news, for Denver had just cabled him when we would arrive and nothing more.|$|E
60|$|March 5.--I have {{returned}} from Romayne's sermon. This double renegade--has he not deserted his religion and his wife?--has failed to convince my reason.

60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} I wound {{and set the}} {{pedometer}} {{and put it in}} my pocket, for I was to carry it next day and keep record of the miles we made.

60|$|I {{have not}} got much to say, and that's the truth; but I cannot let this letter {{go into the}} post without wishing you many many happy returns of your birthday, and sending my love to Auntey and to Katey, and to all of them. We were at Mrs. Macready's last night, {{where there was a}} little party in honour of Mr. Macready's birthday. We had some dancing, and they wished very much that you and Katey had been there; so did I and your mamma. <b>We</b> have not <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Devonshire Terrace yet, but are living at an hotel until Sir James Duke returns from Scotland, which will be on Saturday or Monday.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|R
