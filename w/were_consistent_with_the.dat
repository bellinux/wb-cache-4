Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, {{and his wife}} Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip {{was one of a}} group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The assassins' motives <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.|$|E
5|$|The draft {{had little}} effect on the {{television}} ratings for WWE's programming. Generally, the ratings of the three shows during the week of the draft <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ratings of each from the previous week. The ratings for WWE programming the week before the draft were the following: the April 6 episode of Raw was watched by 5.7 million viewers in its first hour and by 6.1 million viewers in its second hour for an average 3.9 rating, the April 7 episode of ECW on Sci Fi earned a 1.3 television rating, and Friday Night SmackDown earned a 2.0 television rating. The draft episode of Raw was watched by 4.7 million viewers in its first hour, 5.7 in its second hour, and 6.1 in the final hour for an average 3.7 television rating. Later that week, ECW on Sci Fi earned a 1.2 television rating, while Friday Night SmackDown earned a 2.0.|$|E

5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, {{and then at the}} faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E

Brennan was having a great deal of trouble persuading either the Department of Labor or the Lindsay administration to his way of thinking. The Lindsay administration stated that it wanted 4,000 minority trainees as part of the plan, but Brennan wanted no more than 1,000 trainees. Schultz warned labor leaders that the federal government would implement the Philadelphia Plan in 18 cities if suitable local plans were not implemented quickly.|$|E
25|$|According to this theory, {{prospective}} memory {{should be}} enhanced when complete attention {{is given to}} the desired task than when attention is divided among multiple tasks. Research conducted by McDaniel et al. (1998) attempted to prove that prospective memory performance is better on focused tasks as opposed to those where attention is split. Subjects completed a prospective memory task in either a condition where full attention was given or a condition where attention was divided on other tasks. The results <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> PAM theory, showing that participants' prospective memory performance was better with full attention.|$|E

25|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity and assembly trajectory. Baer et al.

Their findings <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, best adapted to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important {{role in determining the}} community structure.|$|E
25|$|Christ Church's {{windows and}} war damage were {{repaired}} after the Civil War. It had its next major renovation in 1882-84, under Rev. James R. Hubbard. This included re-roofing, {{as well as}} installation of stained glass windows. Renovations inside the church <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Oxford Movement (against which Virginia's bishops Johns and Whittle continued to rail). However, Bishop Whittle was pleased to confirm 41 people on March 24, 1884, and the parish hosted the diocesan convention two months later. A side entrance was added in 1895, in addition to further repairs, and the rectory received a new porch and kitchen. The church was wired for electricity in 1906, and a parish house constructed as a memorial to a parishioner. A 1983 renovation removed a wooden organ {{and replaced it with}} a smaller modern instrument, creating a small chapel in that space.|$|E

Several later modifications were introduced, but the style and cut remain fundamentally the same. There were variety of uniforms worn according to setting (work or social) and season (summer or winter). Most uniforms (service, semi-dress, and parade) were stone gray, a brownish-gray color that was conspicuously different from the gray-green of the People's Police. Officers' uniforms differed from those of enlisted personnel by better quality and texture cloth. The field and service uniforms were normal attire for most day-to-day functions.|$|E

25|$|One {{analogy is}} to think of helium-4 as ash, {{and the amount of}} ash that one forms when one {{completely}} burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by stellar nucleosynthesis. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Big Bang theory.|$|E

The court heard that [...] "three circular burn type marks" [...] had been found on Nevill's back.
