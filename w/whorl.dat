5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part of {{the shell}} that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final <b>whorl</b> (known as the body <b>whorl).</b> It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the glossy finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost {{part of the}} shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body <b>whorl</b> is roundly swollen at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|Species {{recognition}} {{is based on}} combinations of minor structural variations in the shape, aperture, <b>whorl</b> contour, umbilical region, and color pattern. It {{appears to be the}} case that many species have a stable color pattern, while other species seem to vary tremendously. Adequate unselected field samples will enable {{a better understanding of the}} relative stability or variability of particular species in single localities.|$|E

50|$|Lundy ponies with 'left' <b>whorls</b> score highly on calmness, placidness, {{enthusiasm and}} friendliness, whereas those with 'right' <b>whorls</b> score highly on wariness, {{associated}} flightiness and unfriendliness. Ponies with two facial <b>whorls</b> are rated as significantly more 'enthusiastic' and less 'wary' {{than those with}} one or three facial <b>whorls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The shell {{has always}} some <b>whorls</b> {{corroded}} with 3-8 <b>whorls.</b>|$|R
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} in rich, mixed upland forests. It is easily {{recognised}} by its attractive three-petaled white flowers, opening from late spring to early summer, that rise above a <b>whorl</b> of three, leaf-like bracts. It {{is an example of}} a spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is synchronised with that of the deciduous woodland which it favours.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a <b>whorl</b> of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner <b>whorl</b> of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles with a shell {{length of}} 0.5–1mm hatch after 30 days (in 25°C), or after 65 days (in 20°C). The ash-free dry weight of newly hatched snails is 0.012mg. The protoconch has one <b>whorl.</b> Capsules laid in spring hatch after 2–3 months, in August–September. Capsules from late summer overwinter because {{embryonic}} development ceases in temperatures below 10°C, thus these capsules hatch in spring after 7–8 months. The shell grows mainly from May to August; {{there is no}} shell growth in winter. The snails reach sexual maturity in less than 1 year, when the shell length is 5.5–5.7mm.|$|E

5|$|The two lions have a male mane, {{patterned}} with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body. Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears {{and on their}} shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped <b>whorl.</b> They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but {{with a degree of}} artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E
5|$|Generally the whorls of {{the shell}} {{increase}} rather regularly in size, however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can have quite different degrees of <b>whorl</b> increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most of the available material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions {{of the shell}} vary greatly both within and between species. The minimum adult size is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult size within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult size that is greater than seven or eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly {{known as}} the dog conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. The shell of adult individuals is coloured from light yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body <b>whorl,</b> a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The shell is valued as an ornament, {{and because it is}} heavy and compact it is also often used as a sinker for fishing nets.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} turbinate in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral with 1.5 <b>whorls.</b> The anal notch is deep, and the {{anterior}} notch is absent. The early <b>whorls</b> are not nodulose {{but may be}} ornamented by an undulating carina. Later <b>whorls</b> may be ornamented with nodules. Cords are absent on the <b>whorls.</b> The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is small.|$|R
50|$|One {{study of}} 219 working horses found a {{relation}} between the direction of facial hair <b>whorls</b> and motor laterality; right-lateralised horses had significantly more clockwise facial hair <b>whorls</b> and left-lateralised horses had significantly more counter-clockwise facial hair <b>whorls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The phrase apical <b>whorls,</b> or protoconch, {{means the}} <b>whorls</b> that {{constitute}} the embryonic shell {{at the apex of}} the shell, especially when this is clearly distinguishable from the later <b>whorls</b> of the shell, otherwise known as the teleoconch.|$|R
5|$|Continuous zonal {{patterns}} {{can take}} the form of whitish subsutural bands (A. similis), heavy subperipheral pigmentation (A. perversus var. infraviridis), subsutural color lines (A. columellaris), broad spiral color bands (A. metabletus, A. webbi), or narrow spiral bands (A. laevus). Interrupted zonation can consist of the interruption of bands into spots in (A. maculatus); highly irregular splitting of zones (A. perversus vars. sultanus and interruptus); formation of oblique radial streaks which run parallel to (in A. inversus) or cross (in A. latestrigatus) the incremental growth lines; or almost every conceivable combination and variation of these factors. Often the pattern will change radically from the apex to the body <b>whorl</b> (in A. quadrasi vars.). The aperture, parietal callus, columella, lip, and umbilical region are variously marked with pink, brown, purple, white, or black. Haniel (1921) includes several color plates which clearly demonstrate the extent of color variation within two species of the Syndromus type. A. perversus and A. maculiferus of the subgenus Amphidromus are equally variable, whereas species such as A. inversus and A. similis are almost uniform in coloration.|$|E
25|$|Amphidromus perversus perversus f. sultanus Lamarck, 1822, has wavy brown bands {{running over}} the entire <b>whorl.</b> The bands are {{interrupted}} {{in the middle of}} the <b>whorl</b> by a narrow spiral band of the ground color. This variation is found in all parts of the species range.|$|E

50|$|Xipheroceras, {{named by}} Buckman, 1911, has an evolute shell, all <b>whorls</b> clearly exposed, only very {{slightly}} impressed dorsally (on the inside curvature). Inner and middle <b>whorls</b> have strong ribs with large spines at the outer ends. Outer <b>whorls</b> have closer simpler ribs.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the shell is high conical. The first <b>whorls</b> are {{straight}} but later <b>whorls</b> are concave.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shell of}} Peltoceras is evolute with <b>whorls</b> hardly embracing, {{so that all}} <b>whorls</b> are mostly exposed. The outer rim, which {{is known as the}} venter, {{aligning}} with the lower part or belly of the animal, is nearly flat. Inner <b>whorls</b> have strong ribs that bifurcate and trifurcate on the ventral margin. The outer <b>whorls</b> have large simple ribs and two rows of massive lateral tubercles, the outer row developing first.|$|R
25|$|The {{shell is}} semi-globose, thin, horny, olivaceous, {{longitudinally}} finely striated. The spire is very short, obtuse. The apex is rather eroded. The last <b>whorl</b> is ventricose. The aperture {{is large and}} semi-ovate. The inner-lip is posteriorly ascending on the body <b>whorl.</b> The columella is straight, excavated, and with a curved, elevated, external ridge continued in front into the outer lip which is simple and acute.|$|E

25|$|The {{species is}} {{particularly}} characterized by its double columellar {{processes in the}} apertural dentition, a splendid discriminating character in shell morphology in this group. In addition, the labrum is sharply angulate at its point of attachment to the body <b>whorl</b> near the angular lamella. This may be an overlooked character as {{this has not been}} checked or noticed in other taxa with similar types of shell until the type description of Gulella systemanaturae. Also, sometimes the labrum is very slightly concave where it joins the body <b>whorl</b> on the columellar side.|$|E
30|$|To {{observe the}} {{symmetry}} between <b>whorls</b> on a left finger and {{that on the}} corresponding right finger, subjects with total of two or four <b>whorls</b> were selected for the test. This strategy was used {{to ensure that the}} distribution of <b>whorls</b> on ten fingers had sufficient degrees of freedom, and that symmetric distribution of <b>whorls</b> between a left finger and the corresponding right finger was observed. In theory, the sum of symmetric finger pairs should be half the total number of <b>whorls.</b> The degree of similarity between the theoretical value and the observed value was reviewed using a binomial test.|$|R

25|$|Species in the {{subgenus}} Gundlachtudora have a shell {{which is}} small in size for this family (type species ca. 9mm maximum width, including peristome), depressed, helicoid in shape. The umbilicus is wide. The protoconch is not decollated, {{and consists of}} 11⁄4 smooth, minute whorls. Spiral sculpture is absent (or barely present in the umbilicus). Axial threads on early whorls are widely spaced, and barely perceptible. On the last <b>whorl</b> there is axial sculpture of microscopic, widely spaced grooves. The aperture is double, circular, adnate to the adjacent <b>whorl,</b> and expanded to various degrees. The operculum is multispiral with a thin, oblique lamella.|$|E
30|$|We {{found that}} the number of <b>whorls</b> of the parents had a {{significant}} impact on the number of <b>whorls</b> of the child. This finding suggested {{that the number of}} <b>whorls</b> on fingers was associated with inheritance, and that our classification method was applicable to the genetic research of fingerprints. Further study also indicated that <b>whorls</b> were distributed randomly on ten fingers instead of a symmetric distribution on a left finger and the corresponding right finger. Thus, we further assumed that fingerprints on ten fingers are controlled by the same gene locus that has two alleles: “whorl gene” (W) and “other gene” (O). Results showed that for a husband and his wife each with similar moderate number of <b>whorls,</b> 1 / 4 of their children had a high number of <b>whorls</b> and that 1 / 4 of their children had a low number of <b>whorls.</b> These results were consistent with theoretical values, suggesting that gene W and gene O are dominant genes.|$|R

One Arabian horse has been recorded with 40 <b>whorls</b> on his body, although the average horse has around six. Bedouins looked for <b>whorls</b> between the horse's ears as a sign of swiftness, and if there were any {{on either side of the}} neck, they were known as the 'finger of the Prophet'.|$|R
