Mrs. Bolton caressed and cajoled the surly undertaker's aide-de-camp, and said, [...] "Lor, Mr. B. who'd have thought to see you away from the Club of a Saturday night. Fanny, dear, get your pa some supper. What will you have, B.? The poor gurl's got a gathering in her eye, or somethink in it--I <b>was</b> <b>lookin</b> at it just now as you came in." [...] And she squeezed her daughter's hand as a signal of prudence and secrecy; and Fanny's tears were dried up likewise; and by that wondrous hypocrisy and power of disguise which women practise, and with which weapons of defence nature endows them, the traces of her emotion disappeared; and she went and took her work, and sate in the corner so demure and quiet, that the careless male parent never suspected that anything ailed her.|$|E

However, {{despite the fact}} that search engines provide considerable assistance in locating information, one of the main difficulties remains the ambiguity and uncertainty involved in matching information needs against documents which might satisfy those needs. A possible solution is the application of natural language dialogue systems, an area that is becoming increasingly prominent in the field of natural language processing.

5000|$|Adrenalin {{created a}} huge buzz among {{fans and the}} music {{industry}} alike, as well as quickly earning the respect of musicians such as Bob Seger and Aerosmith. They continually won awards throughout the late '70s and well into the '80s when Marc Gilbert joined the band and were getting radio airplay across the country. Their albums boasted heartland rockers like [...] "Don't <b>Be</b> <b>Lookin</b> Back," [...] "Faraway Eyes," [...] and [...] "Road Of The Gypsy," [...] a song featured in the film, Iron Eagle. Adrenalin was even in rotation when MTV was still a fledgling station that actually played music videos. They produced an EP, Don't Be Looking Back in 1983, and two albums, American Heart (1984) and Road of the Gypsy (1986) both produced by Vini Poncia.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive analysis {{of exactly what}} visual information about the world is embedded within a single image of an eye. It {{turns out that the}} cornea of an eye and a camera viewing the eye form a catadioptric imaging system. We refer to this as a corneal imaging system. Unlike a typical catadioptric system, a corneal one is flexible in that the reflector (cornea) is not rigidly attached to the camera. Using a geometric model of the cornea based on anatomical studies, its 3 D location and orientation can be estimated from a single image of the eye. Once this is done, a wide-angle view of the environment of the person can be obtained from the image. In addition, we can compute the projection of the environment onto the retina with its center aligned with the gaze direction. This foveated retinal image reveals what the person <b>is</b> <b>lookin...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} many great {{advances}} {{in the field of}} education with regard to students with special needs, especially for those with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social and communication skills, as well as ritualistic and repetitive behavior. To address these core deficits, students with ASD may require supports on many levels in the school setting. Technology provides a new method {{to address the needs of}} those with ASD as well as other disabilities. The use of technology is a way to connect these individuals with their mainstream peers in the classroom and provides a more discrete way of allowing them to have the supports they need. As technological advances are being made, more of these technologies can be incorporated into classroom programs for students who require additional supports. In the 21 st century, technology is becoming increasingly integrated into human society. It is not uncommon to see individuals on iPads, tablets, laptops, and smart phones at home, work, and in public. Even individuals with ASD engage with electronic screen media more than they engage with any other leisure activity (Shane & Albert, 2008).

500|$|Hey Good <b>Lookin</b> <b>is</b> a 1982 American adult {{animated}} {{coming of}} age comedy film written, directed, and produced by Ralph Bakshi. The film takes place in Brooklyn during the 1950s and focuses on Vinnie, {{the leader of a}} gang named [...] "the Stompers," [...] his friend, Crazy Shapiro, and their girls, Roz and Eva. It features the voices of Richard Romanus, David Proval, Tina Bowman, and Jesse Welles.|$|R

Warner Bros. was concerned about any controversy the film would encounter {{as a result of the}} backlash over the film Coonskin, and felt that the film was [...] "unreleasable" [...] because of its mix of live action and animation, and it would not spend further money on the project. Bakshi financed the film's completion himself from the director's fees for other projects such as Wizards, The Lord of the Rings and American Pop. The live-action sequences of Hey Good <b>Lookin</b> <b>were</b> gradually replaced by animation; among the eliminated live-action sequences was one featuring the glam punk band New York Dolls. Singer Dan Hicks worked on the initial musical score, but the final version was scored by John Madara.|$|R

40|$|Applied Physiology, Nieman (11) {{highlighted}} a {{topic that}} has simmered below the surface for decades, i. e., how does the lung acinus expand with lung inflation. Indeed, the topic {{may be the last}} frontier of gross anatomy, but it is one that is sufficiently important in lung health and disease that it warrants a more prominent status. The potential models of acinar ex-pansion were nicely discussed over 25 years ago by Greaves et al. (6), and the schematic drawings of the different expansion modes illustrated in Fig. 1 are derived from this paper. Most of the 19 th and 20 th century studies addressing this issue relied on lungs fixed at a single inflation, so even if all the problems associated with fixation, tissue processing, and inter-preting three-dimensional (3 D) structure from two-dimen-sional sections were resolved, the effect of changes at a different inflation level could still only <b>be</b> evaluated by <b>lookin...</b>|$|R

40|$|The program BLOCKFINDER takes {{a set of}} {{pairwise}} cross-species protein similarity {{relations as}} input. The program defines cliques of orthologous genes and returns conserved paths through the resulting clique order graph as output. Cliques of orthologous genes A set of all-against-all BLASTP comparisons is generated in a preprocessing step. Subsequently, a homology graph is constructed out of the set of n-best-reciprocal BLAST hits where n {{is the number of}} BLAST hits that are considered per gene. Genes are represented as nodes and edges correspond to homology relations. A gene pair get connected if both genes are among the n-best targets in a reciprocal BLAST search. In other words, a gene node may have up to (g − 1) ∗ n homology relations to other genes, where g is the number of species. To identify the orthologous groups we split this graph into its connected components and scan each component for cliques of maximum size, that is subsets of vertices in which an edge exists for each pair of vertices in the set. Clique searching is an NP-complete problem (1), but in our case the maximum clique size k is small enough that we can use a simple algorithm. We choose k = 4 for our evaluation example. All connected pairs of proteins from different species serve as initial cliques. Cliques <b>are</b> augmented by <b>lookin...</b>|$|R
