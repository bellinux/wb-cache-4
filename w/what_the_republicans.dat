Prevention is not abolition, and unjust laws are the only serious enemies that Law ever had. With history before us, it is no treason to question the infallibility of a court; for courts are never wiser or more venerable than the men composing them, and a decision that reverses precedent cannot arrogate to itself any immunity from reversal.

[...] Charges that Soviet spies had infiltrated the government plagued the Truman Administration and also became a [...] "major campaign issue" [...] for Eisenhower.

50|$|In a September 29, 2015 {{interview}} with Fox News's Sean Hannity, McCarthy was asked <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had accomplished in Congress.

Republicans said {{the purpose of the}} government-funded committee was purely to investigate the deaths of four Americans. But McCarthy said, “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened, had we not fought.” Many media outlets and Democratic lawmakers interpreted this comment as an admission that the investigation was a partisan political undertaking rather than a substantive inquiry. Some commentators described his remark as a classic “Kinsley gaffe,” defined as when a politician accidentally tells the truth.|$|E

50|$|The {{mountain}} {{districts of}} Appalachia were often Republican enclaves.

These rural folk had a long-standing hostility toward the planter class. They harbored pro-Union sentiments during the war. Andrew Johnson was their representative leader.

40|$|The {{events of}} September 11 {{prompted}} renewed {{debate about the}} three main approaches to emergency power: statutory, constitutional, and extralegal. But the central substantive problem of the extralegal approach {{has yet to be}} carefully addressed: When may the executive violate the law without a statutory or constitutional basis for doing so? This paper identifies two principles — <b>the</b> privilege of <b>republican</b> prerogative and <b>the</b> obligation of a republican ethic — that combine to offer a coherent answer for certain kinds of executive lawbreaking. As its various strands have emerged from Anglo-American tradition, <b>what</b> I call <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> prerogative becomes available when (i) the republic faces a sudden, irregular, and existentially severe threat; (ii) the executive’s response is strictly necessary and does not exceed the scope of the exigent threat; and (iii) the executive discloses and takes responsibility for <b>the</b> violation. <b>Republican</b> prerogative may not be the only type of justifiable extralegal privilege, but it has a long (though theoretically underdeveloped) historical pedigree and a striking (though latent) coherence. One problem remains. If <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> prerogative is extralegal in character, how can we speak intelligibly of limits on its exercise? The answer identified here emerges from <b>what</b> I call <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> ethic: a normative claim that our constitutional republic is an intrinsically value-bearing entity, worthy of moral consideration and creating moral obligations in its own right. On this view, the moral requirements of a republican ethic — itself grounded in a possessive embrace of our legal system — trump the legal requirements of our Constitution and laws...|$|R
