500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences that <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> through life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was like that when I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E

This is evident in the very first chapter, [...] "Antojos", as Alvarez reveals the panic evoked in the adult Yolanda at the sudden realization that she is stranded in a guava field in the Dominican Republic, where women do not go about unchaperoned at night. Alvarez evokes Yolanda's fear as she reports that [...] "the rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings of her old aunts: <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> lost, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> kidnapped, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> raped, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> killed".|$|R

500|$|Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic {{focused on}} the {{processor}} performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of Home Office Computing praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the [...] display because a full US letter page ( [...] × 11inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and desktop publishing capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: [...] "The Classic's value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> working on that novel, database, or spreadsheet." [...] PC Week criticized {{the lack of a}} faster processor, stating, [...] "The 7.8MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road." [...] Similarly, PC Users review concluded, [...] "The slow processor and lack of expansion slots on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices". MacWEEK described it as a [...] "fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision {{six and a half years}} later". Computer Gaming World was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.|$|E
500|$|Terra's role in Birth by Sleep has {{received}} mixed critics with Adam Ghigiino from PALGN criticizing his naive personality when finding the three protagonists unappealing. VideoGamer.com writer Emily Gera stated that players may {{know little about}} them due to their role in Kingdom Hearts II, but with Birth by Sleep, players will able to know about them. Writing for GamesRadar, Crhis Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of him and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II, although it could be explained once the player finishes Birth by Sleep. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. X-Play found Terra to be very similar to Riku due to his personality and vulnerability to evil's allure. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot criticized Jason Dohring's work as Terra's English voice actor, saying he [...] "can't express angst, excitement, sincerity, or any other emotion", affecting the storyline. VanOrd also pointed this out when Terra interacts with Disney characters, finding the latters' voice actors to be [...] "uniformly excellent and absolutely comparable to the original source." [...] Bob Miur from Destructoid compared Terra's storyline with the film [...] due to the struggles he faces, and found that gamers familiar to the series may realize that his fate in the game [...] "won't turn out to be very pretty." [...] Miur also commented on Dohring's work, praising how he makes Terra [...] "tortured and conflicted", but still criticizing the result. UGO Networks listed Terra's Helmet nineteenth on their list of [...] "The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games", stating [...] "For a minute, but only a minute, the two-horned helmet <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> feeling like the Keyblade is a viable weapon."

[...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person."

King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club.

[...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know.

She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres.
