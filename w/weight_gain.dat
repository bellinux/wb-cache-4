For these reasons, the present study wasundertaken to investigate the effect of oil massage on <b>weight</b> <b>gaining</b> in hospitalized preterm infants inNICU of Ghaem hospital. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was performed in neonatal intensive care unit of Ghaemhospital between April 2007 and April 2008. Sampling was nonrandom and samples were dividedrandomly to three groups: 1) massage with oil 2) massage without oil and 3) control group. Finally, dailyweight gaining was compared between three groups. In this study, 121 preterm neonates (age 0. 05) between three groups. The Mean of <b>weight</b> <b>gaining</b> on day seven was respectively 105 ± 1. 3 g, 52 ± 0. 1 g and 54 ± 1. 3 g in the MCT oil massage group, the group with massage without oil and thecontrol group. These differences were statistically significant only between the MCT oil massage groupand massage group (P= 0. 002) and also between the MCT oil massage group and the control group(p= 0. 000).

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction.

Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands.
