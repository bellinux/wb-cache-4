5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently {{declared}} that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by France, Britain and the United States. By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed that the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that the most effective <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E

5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, Arthur Garfield Hays and Norman Thomas, believed that direct, militant action was the best path.

Another group, including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> change. Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was unwilling}} to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the high level seen during the 1960s as NASA {{prepared}} to send men to the Moon. NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine drew up ambitious plans {{for the establishment of}} a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981. Nixon rejected both proposals due to the expense. Nixon also canceled the Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory program in 1969, because unmanned spy satellites were a more cost-effective <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> the same reconnaissance objective.|$|E
5|$|The first anarchist protest came on 8 December 1933, and {{was easily}} crushed by force {{in most of}} Spain; Zaragoza held out for {{four days before the}} Spanish Republican Army, {{employing}} tanks, stopped the uprising. The Socialists stepped up their rhetoric, hoping to force Zamora to call new elections. Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists continued to prepare, with Carlists undergoing military drills in Navarre; they received the backing of Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Gil Robles struggled to control the RRP's youth wing, which copied Germany and Italy's youth movements. Monarchists turned to the Fascist Falange Española, under the leadership of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> their aims.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching for a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French {{had been unable to}} take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
