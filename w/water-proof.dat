Today, the contents launched by non-governmental organizations include various kinds of media and other goods and essentials. They have sent, for example, U.S. dollars, instant noodles, booklets, nylon stockings and high quality socks, friendly letters, radios, as well as DVDs, USB sticks and SD cards with banned media content. Choco pies have also been included, as they have become prized and valuable items to barter with. After the Sony Pictures Entertainment hacking incident, many activists sent copies of The Interview to North Korea. Some of these movies sent to North Korea have been cut by the activists with the most offensive parts removed. Some of the leaflets launched today are made of light, <b>water-proof</b> polyvinyl.|$|E

There were also almost 70 potential sites where water wells could easily be dug if needed. Elaborate ventilation systems were installed, with 2300 shafts that can be sealed off to protect the tunnels' inhabitants from poison gases, Gas- and <b>water-proof</b> hatches, as well as thick concrete main gates, were constructed to protect the tunnels from biochemical attacks and nuclear fallouts.|$|E
2500|$|Roman dam {{construction}} {{was characterized by}} [...] "the Romans' ability to plan and organize engineering construction on a grand scale." [...] Roman planners introduced the then-novel concept of large reservoir dams which could secure a permanent water supply for urban settlements over the dry season. Their pioneering use of <b>water-proof</b> hydraulic mortar and particularly Roman concrete allowed for much larger dam structures than previously built, such as the Lake Homs Dam, possibly the largest water barrier to that date, and the Harbaqa Dam, both in Roman Syria. The highest Roman dam was the Subiaco Dam near Rome; its record height of [...] remained unsurpassed until its accidental destruction in 1305.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{presents the}} development of parylene thin-film deposition from the micrometer scale to nanometer scale. Processes improved film uniformity by 6 % in the nanometer scale {{to meet the requirements}} of new applications of parylene, such as the delamination layer of organic light-emitting diodes, the dielectric film of through-silicon-via, and <b>water-proofing</b> mobile phones. The application and process of <b>water-proofing</b> mobile phones is also examined. The tested mobile phone was coated with a 0. 5 μm parylene coating and functioned properly while submerged underwater. The mobile phone is still operational; thus, nanoscale parylene deposition is a novel application for <b>water-proofing</b> mobile phones. The application does not concern problems associated with parts assembly or damaged rubber material...|$|R

To do this, homemade, commercial glue and gelatin was selected and evaluated water reaction and weatherproof.
