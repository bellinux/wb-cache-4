25|$|When I was a kid, {{my father}} told me about an {{accident}} that happened while he was working on Grand Coulee Dam in Washington. (At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of <b>wet</b> <b>concrete</b> into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
500|$|However {{the most}} {{dangerous}} eruptive feature are the pyroclastic flows generated by material collapse, which move {{down the side of}} the mountain at extreme speeds of up to [...] per hour and with the ability to extend the reach of the eruption hundreds of kilometers.

50|$|The UTQGS {{traction}} test procedure measures a tire’s {{coefficient of friction}} when it is tested on <b>wet</b> asphalt and <b>concrete</b> surfaces. The test tire is installed on an instrumented axle of a traction trailer, which is towed by a truck at 40 miles per hour (mph) over <b>wet</b> asphalt and <b>concrete</b> surfaces. The tow truck is equipped with an on-board water supply system that sprays water {{in front of the}} test tire. The brakes, from the test tire only, are momentarily locked, and sensors on the axle measure the longitudinal and vertical forces as it slides in a straight line. The coefficient of friction for the pair, test tire and surface, is then determined as the ratio of the longitudinal and vertical forces.|$|R
500|$|The hot, {{exploding}} material also {{broke apart}} and melted {{nearly all of}} the mountain's glaciers along with most of the overlying snow.

Based on Anita Loos' bestselling novel and its Broadway version, the film focuses on two [...] "gold-digging" [...] showgirls, Lorelei Lee and Dorothy Shaw, played by Monroe and Jane Russell. The role of Lorelei was originally intended for Betty Grable, who had been 20th Century-Fox's most popular [...] "blonde bombshell" [...] in the 1940s; Monroe was fast eclipsing her as a star who could appeal to {{both male and female}} audiences. As part of the film's publicity campaign, she and Russell pressed their hand and footprints in <b>wet</b> <b>concrete</b> outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in June. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was released shortly after and became one of the biggest box office successes of the year by grossing $5.3 million, more than double its production costs. Crowther of The New York Times and William Brogdon of Variety both commented favorably on Monroe, especially noting her performance of [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"; according to the latter, she demonstrated the [...] "ability to sex a song as well as point up the eye values of a scene by her presence".|$|E

2500|$|Workability can be {{measured}} by the concrete slump test, a simple measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the ASTM C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an [...] "Abrams cone" [...] with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value {{of one or two}} inches (25 or 50mm) out of one foot (305mm). A relatively <b>wet</b> <b>concrete</b> sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also {{be measured}} by the flow table test.|$|E
2500|$|Many stories {{exist to}} explain {{the origins of the}} footprints. The theatre's {{official}} account in its books and souvenir programs credit Norma Talmadge as having inspired the tradition when she accidentally stepped into the <b>wet</b> <b>concrete.</b> However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast of a radio adaptation of A Star Is Born, Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was [...] "pure accident. I walked right into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was. So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it." [...] Still another account by the construction foreman, Jean Klossner, recounts that Klossner autographed his work next to the right-hand poster kiosk and that Grauman and he developed the idea then and there. His autograph and handprint, dated 1927, remain today. The theatre's third founding partner, Douglas Fairbanks, was the second celebrity, after Talmadge, to be immortalized in the concrete.|$|E

For decades, Besser block was a worldwide standard term for masonry construction blocks. The Alpena-based Besser Company, which inventor Besser ran for many decades, manufactured these machines and made a fortune for Besser and his family. Concrete block became a feature of worldwide construction solutions in World War II and following years. Commencing in 1964, Besser turned over part of his assets to the newly founded Jesse Besser Museum, now known as the Besser Museum for Northeast Michigan, as an endowment.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Self-Compacting Concretes (SCCs) were {{manufactured}} {{by using the}} following ingredients particularly suitable for structures which need low heat of hydration such as mass concrete structures: CEM III/A 32. 5 R (with 60 % of GGBS) at a dosage of 300 kg/m 3, ground limestone, PFA, ground PFA, aggregate with maximum size of 20 mm, ultra-fine amorphous colloidal silica (UFACS), and acrylic polymer superplasticizer. The following properties were determined on the fresh concrete mixtures: slump flow, bleeding capacity, and bulk density. The following properties were measured on the hardened concrete specimens: compressive strength at 1, 3, 7, 28, and 60 days, water permeability at 28 days on <b>wet</b> cured <b>concrete</b> specimens, chloride diffusion and carbonation rate, shrinkage, and thermal heating.

40|$|The {{equations}} governing drying and <b>wetting</b> of <b>concrete</b> are formulated, {{assuming the}} diffusivity and other material param-eters to {{be dependent on}} pore humidity, temperature and degree of hydration. By fitting of computer solutions for slabs, cylinders and spheres against numerous test data available in the literature it is found that the diffusion coefficient decreases about 10 to 20 times when passing from 0. 9 to 0. 6 pore humidity. The problem is thus strongly nonlinear. Dependence on temperature is found to agree satisfactorily with the rate process theory. Effect of temperature on equilibrium pore humidity is also studied. The aging effect is defined by means of an equivalent hydration period. To enable easy prediction of drying of simple bodies, charts for the solution in terms of nondimensional variables are presented. Finally, correlation to the diffusion in a saturated concrete is discussed...|$|R
