In his {{description}} of the Pazardzhik district (kaza) published in 1870, he writes that a previously existing church in roughly the same place was dedicated to Saint Pantaleon and had given its name to the village of Patalenitsa. The Church of St Pantaleon was, according to Zahariev, previously an Ancient Greek sanctuary of Asclepius. He writes that a column from this church with an inscription dedicated to Asclepius was preserved in the newer village church.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} of the first government body created after the May Revolution, Saavedra is considered the first ruler of Argentina. However, as the Spanish juntas were not a presidential system, Saavedra <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> President of Argentina; that office would be created a decade afterwards. The Casa Rosada, official residence of the President of Argentina, holds a bust of Saavedra at the Hall of busts.|$|E

Norsemen reached North America and even established settlements, though these ended in failure sometime {{before the end of the}} 15th century. Christopher Columbus, on his third voyage to the New World in 1498, traveled along part of what would later become Venezuela.|$|E

5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs {{to a point of}} land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|Dickens <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{author to}} {{celebrate}} the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared {{the belief that the}} staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.|$|E
5|$|Eskimo <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{dramatic}} film {{to use an}} all-native {{cast for}} the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film In the Land of the Head Hunters. It was, however, the first motion picture to be filmed {{in the language of}} a Native American people, and the first feature film shot in Alaska. Ray Mala became nationally famous for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a long career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 Harcourt Williams, newly {{appointed}} {{as director of}} productions at the Old Vic, invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season. The Old Vic, in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames, was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class audience at low ticket prices. She paid her performers very modest wages, but the theatre was known for its unrivalled repertory of classics, mostly Shakespeare, and Gielgud <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> West End star to take a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Morley's words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas.|$|E
5|$|In the film, James Bond {{is sent to}} Jamaica to {{investigate}} the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch with a radio beam weapon. Although {{the first of the}} Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character; the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film also introduced the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which would also appear in six subsequent films.|$|E

Tan's Film had released Gagak Item (The Black Crow), with Rd Mochtar as the masked Black Crow, in 1939, and later productions, including Java Industrial Film's Srigala Item (The Black Wolf; 1941), continued the trend. As was common for contemporary productions, the soundtrack for Kedok Ketawa– performed by Poniman– consisted of kroncong songs.|$|E
5|$|Leonid Kinskey as Sascha, the Russian {{bartender}} {{infatuated with}} Yvonne. He {{was born into}} a Jewish family in Russia and had immigrated to the United States. He told Aljean Harmetz, author of Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca, that he was cast because he was Bogart's drinking buddy. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> choice for the role; he replaced Leo Mostovoy, who was deemed not funny enough.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{reported}} {{case of a}} ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E
