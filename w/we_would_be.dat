25|$|Ursula Voss of the Universität Bonn {{believes}} that the theory of protoconsciousness may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep. She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as {{if we continue to}} study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today's world.|$|E

500|$|The National Congress of Brazil {{passed a}} large naval {{acquisition}} program on 14 December 1904, {{but it was}} two years before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships to fill the gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered. One, supported by the British armament company Armstrong Whitworth (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships. Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that [...] "with six small battleships <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> much better. If we lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with. But with three ? With two damaged or destroyed, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> left with one only." ...|$|E
500|$|The actual {{date was}} chosen by General Kenney based {{on the advice of}} his two weather-forecasting teams, one Australian and one American. Ideally, Z-Day would be clear from Port Moresby to Nadzab but foggy over New Britain, thereby {{preventing}} the Japanese air forces at Rabaul from intervening. Forecasting the weather days in advance with such precision was difficult enough in peacetime, but more so in wartime, when many of the areas from which the weather patterns developed were occupied by the enemy and data from them was consequently denied to the forecasters. When the two teams differed over the best possible date, Kenney [...] "split {{the difference between the two}} forecasts and told General MacArthur <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ready to go on the morning of the 4th for the amphibious movement of the 9th Division to Hopoi Beach and about nine o’clock on the morning of the 5th <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ready to fly the 503rd Parachute Regiment to Nadzab." ...|$|E

500|$|Moran {{apologized for}} the remarks, saying that [...] "I should not have singled out the Jewish {{community}} and regret giving any impression that its members are somehow responsible for the course of action being pursued by the administration, or are somehow behind an impending war... What I {{was trying to say}} is that if more organizations in this country, including religious groups, were more outspoken against war, then I do not think <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> pursuing war as an option." ...|$|E
500|$|Nader {{lost the}} role again in February 2001 {{as a result}} of the actor getting arrested for {{allegedly}} selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. All My Children released an official statement saying, [...] "If Mr. Nader gets the help that he needs and addresses his problem, and it makes sense for the show, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prepared to speak with Michael in the future." [...] The network put Nader on probation and ordered him to seek help for his problem.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{strong support}} from the black community, all the {{students}} who had been arrested were convicted of disorderly conduct and fined $50. The students refused to pay the fines, however, and chose instead to serve thirty-three days in the county workhouse. Diane Nash issued a statement {{on behalf of the}} students explaining the decision: [...] "We feel that if we pay these fines <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants." ...|$|E

30|$|Human brain cannot {{function}} in a completely deterministic way, because then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> able to create anything new, neither in a completely stochastic (random) way, because then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> able to perform any intended action, even to press a specific key on the keyboard with our finger. In creative processes human brain must therefore act as a complex dynamic system, showing among others features these of deterministic chaos.|$|R
500|$|Despite her {{generally}} leftist views, Barr voiced {{her support}} for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in a June 2016 The Hollywood Reporter interview. [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so lucky if Trump won. Because then it wouldn't be Hillary." [...] A July CNN story {{reported that she}} did not endorse Trump as she only supports herself for president -- [...] "I will be writing myself in in every election from now until I win." [...] However in a tweet to The Jerusalem Post, Barr revealed she voted for Trump.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Noi doi", when {{translated}} to English, feature {{an invitation to}} a love interest: [...] "Baby/ Would you do me a favor/ If you come to the sea/ <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> both under the sun/ Under the sun, both of us". Regarding this, Stan said in a press release: [...] "I am the child of the sea, I feed myself with the sun, I love the energy of the water and I think that's what sea means: happiness, fun, where the stress disappears and also the ideal place to start relationships".|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, Lee {{provoked}} more debate after {{suggesting that}} [...] "If they (Malaysia) would just educate the Chinese and Indians, use them and {{treat them as}} their citizens, they can equal us (Singapore) and even do better than us and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> happy to rejoin them." [...] UMNO Information Chief Muhammad Muhammad Taib responded, telling the press that Malaysia implemented policies to assist economically disadvantaged Malays, instead of neglecting them as Singapore did, stating also {{that at one point}} the Malays would have to compete on a level playing field with other Malaysians.|$|E

500|$|In mid-1949, Nixon, {{although}} {{anxious to}} advance his political career, {{was reluctant to}} run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary. He considered his party's prospects in the House to be bleak, absent a strong Republican trend, and wrote [...] "I seriously doubt if we can ever work our way back in power. Actually, in my mind, I do not see any great gain in remaining a member of the House, even from a relatively good District, if it means <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> simply a vocal but ineffective minority." ...|$|E
500|$|The first US consuls in Mogadishu set {{up their}} initial office {{in a small room}} in the city's Public Works Department building. Shortly thereafter, an Italian {{contractor}} built the first US chancery in downtown Mogadishu. According to John Blane, the vice consul in Mogadishu from 1956 to 1957, the first chancery was a [...] "a rather miserable effort." [...] He [...] "felt that if it stood up for five years, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> extremely lucky," [...] but the building remained the US chancery for three decades. By the time it closed, the old chancery {{was one of the most}} dilapidated buildings the State Department had, according to Ambassador Bishop.|$|E
500|$|In the US, {{the first}} promo for [...] "Hello, Goodbye" [...] was premiered on The Ed Sullivan Show on 26 November. Author Mark Hertsgaard {{describes}} {{the film as}} [...] "a slapdash affair featuring the hula dancers that was salvaged only by some ludicrously spastic dancing by Lennon". Music critic Robert Christgau was also unimpressed; speculating in the May 1968 issue of Esquire {{on the content of}} the Magical Mystery Tour film, which had yet to air in America, Christgau wrote: [...] "But if Paul McCartney's work on the film clip of 'Hello Goodbye' is any indication, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wise not to hope for too much." ...|$|E

500|$|Stewart himself {{says that}} he does not {{perceive}} his show as cynical. [...] "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," [...] he says. [...] "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live. [...] "If government suddenly became inspiring... <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Rhimes {{stated that}} she did not feel Izzie's {{character}} arc—specifically her relationship with Alex—had fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the seventh season. She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure. Instead, she concluded: [...] "I'm open to seeing Izzie again. So if she [...] were to come back, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> thrilled to [...] But if she doesn't, we'll just move on." [...] Heigl also went on to say in October 2010 that the character returning to show looks bleak because, [...] "that chapter is closed, and it's sad. And it's hard." [...] She also felt that Izzie coming back to the show would, [...] "just feel manipulative." ...|$|E
500|$|Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh. When {{creating}} the character, screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women {{were expected to}} behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite. Wasikowska read Carroll's books {{as a child and}} re-read them to prepare for her role. She also watched Jan Švankmajer's Alice. She said, [...] "When we were kids, my mum would pop it in the VCR player. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> disturbed, and wouldn't really understand it, but we couldn't look away because it was too intriguing. So I had kept that feeling about Alice, a kind of haunting feeling." [...] Although facing pressures to conform to society's expectations, Alice grows into a stronger-willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as [...] "stubborn, brave, [...] non-girlie".|$|E
