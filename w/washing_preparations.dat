40|$|The calmodulin {{and calcium}} {{dependence}} of human adenylate cyclase {{from the second}} part of the duodenum was assessed in <b>washed</b> particulate <b>preparations</b> of biopsy specimens by investigating (a) the concentration dependent effects of free [Ca 2 +] on enzyme activity, (b) the effects of exogenous calmodulin on enzyme activity in ethylene glycol bis (b-aminoethyl ether) N,N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) <b>washed</b> particulate <b>preparations,</b> and (c) the effects of calmodulin antagonists on enzyme activity. Both basal (IC 50 = 193. 75 (57. 5) nmol/l (mean (SEM)) and NaF stimulated (IC 50 = 188. 0 (44. 0) nmol/l) adenylate cyclase activity was strongly inhibited by free [Ca 2 +] greater than 90 nmol/l. Free [Ca 2 +] less than 90 nmol/l had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. NaF stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited by 50 % at 2. 5 mmol/l EGTA. This inhibition could not be reversed by free Ca 2 +. The addition of exogenous calmodulin to EGTA (5 mmol/l) <b>washed</b> particulate <b>preparations</b> failed to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. Trifluoperazine and N-(8 -aminohexyl) - 5 -IODO- 1 -naphthalene-sulphonamide (IODO 8) did not significantly inhibit basal and NaF stimulated adenylate cyclase activity when measured at concentrations of up to 100 mumol/l.

The Mr 68, 000 phosphoprotein is structurally identical to the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (P 1) which phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eucaryotic initiation factor- 2 (eIF- 2). A similar protein of Mr 68, 000 is more phosphorylated in poliovirus-infected cells than in mock-infected cells. Increased phosphorylation of P 1 protein in poliovirus-infected cells, however, does not result in an increased phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of endogenous or exogenously added eIF- 2, both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Boric acid {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{inorganic}} compound in pharmaceutical industry. We find its utilization as an antiseptic, in eye <b>wash</b> <b>preparations,</b> as an insecticidal, as a buffering agent etc. In this present work, a comparative study of the UV-Vis spectras of the boric acid solution in different solvents have been done. A variety of solvents like water, ethanol, methanol, glacial acetic acid, hexane, Tetrahydrofuran and 0. 2 M HCl solution have been employed for spectral analysis. When water was taken as a solvent, aqueous boric acid solution gave negative absorbance in complete range of UV-Vis analysis i. e. 1100 nm to 190 nm. In contrary to this, when methanolic solution of boric acid was taken, positive absorbance in the complete range of spectrum was noticed. Purely on the basis of spectras obtained for boric acid solution in different solvents, best solvent out of those have been regarded as the most suitable solvent for carrying out the UV-Vis analysis for boric acid.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of prostaglandin E (PGE) by {{normal and}} neoplastic macrophages is intrinsically linked to their synthesis of, and exposure to, myeloid colony-stimulating factors (CS-factors). The defect in responsiveness to endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by macrophages from C 3 H/HeJ mice extends equally to {{the synthesis of}} CS-factor and PGE. However, C 3 H/HeJ macrophages can be stimulated to synthesize PGE by treatment with agents other than LPS [zymosan, tuberculin purified protein derivative, concanavalin A, poly(I). poly(C) ], which also stimulate CS-factor production, or {{by the addition of}} various preparations of soluble CS-factor. In peritoneal <b>wash</b> <b>preparations,</b> constitutive PGE synthesis occurred in rapidly sedimenting macrophage cells, whereas constitutive CS-factor production and inducible PGE synthesis occurred in slower sedimenting adherent cells. A similar functional heterogeneity in CS-factor and PGE production was found in neoplastic macrophagae cell lines.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which endotoxins enhance the secretory response of <b>washed</b> <b>preparations</b> of human platelets to aggregated immunoglobulins (Agg-HGG) has been examined. Preparations of endotoxins from several rough mutants of bacteria enhance, by approximately 50 -fold, the release of serotonin initiated by Agg-HGG. Endotoxins from smooth strains do not manifest this enhancement, and all endotoxin preparations are completely inactive {{in the absence of}} Agg-HGG. Preincubation and wash experiments have demonstrated that the critical initial interaction is the formation of complexes between the endotoxin and the Agg-HGG stimulus and is not dependent on an initial endotoxin-platelet interaction. Pretreatment of platelets with substimulatory concentrations of Agg-HGG, followed by the addition of endotoxin, causes a temporal decay in the degree of endotoxin-induced enhancement, which is inversely related to the concentration of Agg-HGG. This stimulus-specific desensitization suggests that the endotoxin-Agg-HGG complexes initiate release by a pathway similar to that initiated by Agg-HGG alone. We postulate that the endotoxin either enhances or stabilizes a localized platelet membrane perturbation or deformation, initiated by the Agg-HGG stimulus...|$|R

High-molecular-mass (> 106 Da) components in crude root washes agglutinated only particular saprophytic, fluorescent Pseudomonas isolates. Ion-exchange {{treatment of the}} crude root <b>washes</b> resulted in <b>preparations</b> of lower-molecular-mass (105 to 106 Da) fractions which agglutinated almost all Pseudomonas isolates examined. Also, components able to suppress agglutination reactions of pseudomonads with the lower-molecular-mass root components were detected in crude root washes of all crops studied. Pseudomonas isolates were differentially agglutinated by both types of root components. The involvement of {{these two types of}} root components in short-term adherence and in colonization was studied in potato, tomato, and grass, using Pseudomonas isolates from these crops. Short-term adherence of isolates to roots was independent of their agglutination with either type of root components. With agglutination-negative mutants, the high-molecular-mass components seemed to be involved in adherence of Pseudomonas putida Corvallis to roots of all crops studied. Short-term adherence to roots of four Pseudomonas isolates could be influenced by addition of both crude and ion-exchange-treated root washes, depending on their agglutination phenotype with these root <b>wash</b> <b>preparations.</b> Potato root colonization by 10 different isolates from this crop, over a period of 7 days, was not correlated with their agglutination phenotype.

The optimum composition was found to be PCMHT-PVC-KTpClPB-BA with the ratios of 6. 0 : 30. 0 : 5. 0 : 59. 0, respectively. The Nernstian response was of 21. 8 ± 0. 5 mV decade- 1 of Er(III) activity, the linear range of the sensor was found to be relatively wide (from 1. 0 x 10 - 5 to 1. 0 x 10 - 2 mol L- 1).

40|$|Infection of mouse L-cell spinner {{cultures}} by {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus (VSV) effected the selective translation of viral mRNA by 4 h after viral adsorption. Cell-free systems prepared from mock- and VSV-infected cells reflected this phenomenon; protein synthesis was reduced in the virus-infected cell lysate by approximately 75 % {{compared with the}} mock-infected (control) lysate. This effect appeared to be specific to protein synthesis initiation since (i) methionine incorporation into protein from an exogenous preparation of initiator methionyl-tRNA gave completely analogous results and (ii) {{the addition of a}} ribosomal salt wash (containing protein synthesis initiation factors) stimulated protein synthesis by the infected cell lysate but had no effect on protein synthesis by the control. Micrococcal nuclease-treated (initiation-dependent) VSV-infected cell lysates were not able to translate L-cell mRNA unless they were supplemented with a ribosomal salt wash; a salt wash from ribosomes from uninfected cells effected a quicker recovery than a salt wash from ribosomes from infected cells.

40|$|Electron {{transfer}} {{activity in}} intact trichomes of Spirulina platensis (Nordst.) Geitl. {{can be observed}} with either CO 2 or methylviologen as the Hill acceptor. Ferricyanide cannot penetrate the intact trichomes, but photoreduction of this oxidant can be observed when mediated by lipophilic oxidants such as p-phenylenediamine or 2, 5 -dimethyl-p-benzoquinone. The insensitivity of these reactions to dibromothymoquinone indicates that they are due largely to the activity of photosystem II. Direct photoreduction of ferricyanide {{can be observed in}} spheroplasts of Spirulina, indicating that such preparations have altered permeability properties when compared with intact trichomes. Preparation of these spheroplasts, which are osmotically fragile, requires that intact trichomes be washed with KCl and EDTA to induce lysozyme sensitivity and thereby allow digestion of the cell wall. The KCl/EDTA washing procedure used for spheroplast preparation alters the permeability of Spirulina trichomes, as evidenced by the ability of these preparations to photoreduce ferricyanide. This photoreduction reaction is insensitive to dibromothymoquinone, and is stimulated by high concentrations of divalent cations. During assays, the reaction is inhibited by the inclusion of polyethyleneglycol as an osmotic protectant. Photoreduction of methylviologen and NADP+ is also observed in the washed trichomes, along with an endogenously catalyzed photoreduction of O 2 to H 2 O 2. Photophosphorylation cannot be observed in the <b>washed</b> <b>preparations,</b> but cyclic photophosphorylation with phenazinemethosulfate is observed after mild sonication.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study, {{manganese}} (Mn 2 +), a neuromuscular blocker with pre and postsynaptic actions, {{was used to}} verify the neurotoxicity and myotoxicity induced by Crotalus durissus terrificus (Cdt) and Bothrops jararacussu (Bjssu) venoms in biventer cervicis preparations (BCp). Preparations pretreated with 0. 66 and 1. 6 mM Mn 2 + did not affect Cdt venom-induced blockage nor change KCl-induced contracture but partially reduced ACh-induced contracture. However, both Mn 2 + concentrations partially hindered Bjssu venom-induced blockage after <b>washing</b> the <b>preparations</b> with Krebs solution, and only 1. 6 mM Mn 2 + preparations significantly recovered ACh-induced contracture. The effect of Cdt venom myotoxicity on contractile responses was {{different from that of}} Bjssu venom myotoxicity. Pretreatment with 1. 6 mM Mn 2 + partially reduced muscle damage percentage and creatine kinase (CK) activity (U/l) induced by both venoms. In conclusion, Mn 2 + interfered in ACh-induced contracture of the nicotinic receptor; did not prevent Cdt venom neurotoxicity but partially reduced its myotoxicity in vitro due to the stabilizing action of this venom on the sarcolemmal membrane; and partially attenuate...|$|R
40|$|Alpidem analogues {{containing}} a GABA (1 - 3) or glycine (4 - 6) moiety were synthesized and their {{interaction with the}} GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex at central (CBR) and peripheral (PBR) level was evaluated. In particular, their ability to modulate the specific binding of [H- 3]-GABA to <b>washed</b> membrane <b>preparations</b> from the rat cerebral cortex, {{as well as their}} effects on human recombinant GABA(A) receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes, were assessed. Results from these in vitro assays showed that the most active compounds were 1 and 4. Intraperitoneal administration of compound 1 at a dose of 150 mg/kg significantly antagonized pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in rats and the protective effects were evident for 90 min. However, compound 4 failed to interact with strychnine-sensitive Gly-binding sites. Consistent with these binding results, intraperitoneal administration of compound 4 at 150 mg/kg showed no effect against convulsions induced by strychnine, except for a prolonged time of the latency of convulsions. The results obtained suggest that compound 1 possesses interesting anticonvulsant activity and deserves further investigation as a novel lipophilic GABA derivative. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Participation in {{external}} {{quality assessment}} {{is an integral}} part of laboratory work and mandatory when the results have a clinical application, which is one of the requirements of standard 15189 for accreditation of medical laboratories. Institute of Clinical Chemistry, the first laboratory accredited for clinical cell analysis by flow cytometry in Croatia, participated in UKNEQAS for Leukocyte Immunophenotyping in 3 schemes: »Immune Monitoring«, »CD 34 Stem Cell Enumeration« and »Leukaemia Immunophenotyping«. For sample processing on EPICS XL flow cytometer, lyse/no <b>wash</b> <b>preparation</b> technique with ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) or ImmunoPrep lysing reagent was employed. In »Immune monitoring« programme CD 45 /sideward light scatter (SSC) proposed gating strategy was adopted for lymphocyte subsets, while modified ISHAGE protocol was used for CD 34 + cell enumeration. Absolute count determination was performed on flow cytometer using FlowCount beads solution. In the period from the beginning of 2006 until the middle of 2009 a total number of 100 stabilized whole blood samples were processed. The relative and absolute enumeration results for lymphocyte subsets were within tolerable limits, in 97. 1 and 97. 1 % of cases, and 95 and 90 % of CD 34 + cell enumeration, respectively. In immune monitoring CD 45 /SSC proposed gating strategy is the most frequent analysis used (> 85 % participants) and ISHAGE protocol for CD 34 + cell determination with continuous rise from 76 to 83 %. A number of participants who accept beads method for absolute count enumeration on flow cytometer get greater, 69 to 86 %, while FlowCount was the second of bead-based techniques used (25 and 35 %). Sample treatment in lyse/no wash technique using NH 4 Cl lysing solution was dominant procedure used by more than 1 / 3 participants, although its home made solution has replaced slowly by commercial reagents. The unacceptable results, 6 of 244, were obtained for 20 most frequently determined cell antigens in »Leukaemia Immunophenotyping« samples screened for leukaemia/lymphoma. Processing results of all participants showed that the deviation from laboratory guidelines and the use of older methods for cell identification, quantification of cell counting on haematology analyser, or usage an antibody conjugated with fluorochrome lesser fluorescence quantum often lead to an unacceptable result, although is noticeable trend to accept new referrals and protocols to reduce the inter-laboratory differences...|$|R
