50|$|In {{practice}} for the ARCA 200 race at Daytona International Speedway on 7 February 1985 while traveling at an estimated 195 miles per hour, Affleck got his car sideways between turns 1 & 2, went airborne, and barrel rolled end over end at least 7 or 8 times. The protective <b>window</b> <b>netting</b> on his car failed and Affleck was thrown partially {{out of his car}} and sustained head and neck injuries after being pinned under his Ford. He was survived by Kathleen, his wife of 15 years, and two sons. Affleck's crash also changed the way that the protective window nettings are constructed on both NASCAR and ARCA cars to this very day. Francis Affleck became the first ARCA driver to be fatally injured at the Daytona International Speedway in its then 26-year history, and the first driver to be killed at the track since Ricky Knotts in 1980.|$|E
50|$|Derby had budgeted for {{a fourth}} bottom finish (i.e. survival) in the Premier League and when this was not {{achieved}} the club was once again plunged into financial crisis. In an attempt to bounce {{back to the top}} flight at the first time of asking the club rejected offers for their better players over the summer -such as Malcolm Christie, Mart Poom, Danny Higginbotham and Chris Riggott - and an opening day 3-0 win over Reading seemed to have justified the decision. However, this proved a false dawn and a 1-0 defeat away to Gillingham in the next game signalled what was to come as the club won just 10 of its opening 29 fixtures and suffered embarrassing cup exits to lower league teams Brentford (FA Cup) and Oldham Athletic (League Cup). Players weren't paid on time (resulting in Danny Higginbotham going on strike), with high earning players such as Georgi Kinkladze and Fabrizio Ravanelli underperforming, and the club was trading insolvent. Christie, Riggott, Higginbotham and Poom were eventually sold in the January 2002 Transfer <b>window,</b> <b>netting</b> considerably less than they would have if sold the previous summer, and joined players like Horacio Carbonari, Darryl Powell and Deon Burton in exiting the club (Burton leaving as the club's most capped ever player, with 42 appearances for Jamaica). With the club low on registered professionals, home grown youngsters were given a chance at first team level, with Lee Holmes (who became the youngest player in the club's history when he took the field against Grimsby aged 15 years and 268 days), Lee Grant, Pablo Mills, Izale McLeod and Lee Camp all handed debuts throughout the course of the season. Although the club won its first game following the exodus 3-0 against Rotherham United they then embarked on 9 match winless streak which seriously threatened relegation. The eight match of this run was a 0-3 defeat by Nottingham Forest and Gregory was suspended the next day, the club alleging serious misconduct. Nothing specific was ever offered ad the next board had to pay Gregory a seven figure settlement. Gregory's replacement (initially on a short term contract {{until the end of the}} season but then appointed full-time) was former Ipswich Town boss George Burley. His remit was simple: avoid relegation. A 2-1 win over Norwich City in Burley's first match got his reign off to the perfect start, and although only 6 points were taken from the next 6 games, it was enough to finish 18th in the league with 52 points, 6 clear of relegated Sheffield Wednesday in 22nd.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mosquito-borne {{diseases}} {{are still a}} major health risk in many developing countries, {{and the emergence of}} multi-insecticide-resistant mosquitoes is threatening the future of vector control. Therefore, new tools that can manage resistant mosquitoes are required. Laboratory studies show that entomopathogenic fungi can kill insecticide-resistant malaria vectors but this needs to be verified in the field. Methods The present study investigated whether these fungi will be effective at infecting, killing and/or modifying the behaviour of wild multi-insecticide-resistant West African mosquitoes. The entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana were separately applied to white polyester <b>window</b> <b>netting</b> and used in combination with either a permethrin-treated or untreated bednet in an experimental hut trial. Untreated nets were used because we wanted to test the effect of fungus alone and in combination with an insecticide to examine any potential additive or synergistic effects. Results In total, 1125 female mosquitoes were collected during the hut trial, mainly Culex quinquefasciatus Say. Unfortunately, not enough wild Anopheles gambiae Giles were collected to allow the effect the fungi may have on this malaria vector to be analysed. None of the treatment combinations caused significantly increased mortality of Cx. quinquefasciatus when compared to the control hut. The only significant behaviour modification found was a reduction in blood feeding by Cx. quinquefasciatus, caused by the permethrin and B. bassiana treatments, although no additive effect was seen in the B. bassiana and permethrin combination treatment. Beauveria bassiana did not repel blood foraging mosquitoes either in the laboratory or field. Conclusions This {{is the first time that}} an entomopathogenic fungus has been shown to reduce blood feeding of wild mosquitoes. This behaviour modification indicates that B. bassiana could potentially be a new mosquito control tool effective at reducing disease transmission, although further field work in areas with filariasis transmission should be carried out to verify this. In addition, work targeting malaria vector mosquitoes should be carried out to see if these mosquitoes manifest the same behaviour modification after infection with B. bassiana conidia. </p...|$|E

For most of {{the latter half of}} the race, Busch put on a stellar performance, not only running up front but holding up his <b>window</b> <b>net</b> up with his left hand. In the end, it would be of no use, as NASCAR officials eventually black flagged Busch. Right before he pitted, Busch got a break in the form of a caution.
