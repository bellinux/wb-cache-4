40|$|Abstract. Today, kiosk automata (kiosks, for short) {{are used}} for variety of services: from all sort of kiosks for {{providing}} informations, to kiosks for paying tickets and ATM's. Kiosks are usually programmed either using high level programming languages, like C++, or using HTML in conjunction with web browser. In this paper, we analyzed a vast range of kiosk automata and derived common characteristics. We present approach for programming kiosk applications based on Domain Specific Language (DSL), designed specifically {{to meet the needs}} of developing kiosk applications that are usually programmed using high level programming languages and are deployed on kiosks with <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitors.</b> Our goal is to make development of such kiosk applications more rapid, while minimizing number of programming errors...|$|R
40|$|Two orangutans’ and one gorilla’s {{understanding}} of social relationships was investigated using twodimensional photographs {{displayed on a}} <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor.</b> Unlike the photos used in similar studies, the photos presented here were not of exclusively familiar or related individuals, thus eliminating the use of previously learned associations or “genetic” similarities as cues. In Experiment 1, the subjects discriminated photos of mother-offspring pairs from photographs depicting other social relationships (siblings, unrelated group mates, mated pairs). In Experiment 2, they matched photos of mother-offspring pairs, mated pairs, siblings and groups of animals in a delayed matchingto- sample task (DMTS). In Experiment 3, they matched photographs depicting various behaviors (sleeping, eating, playing and grooming) in another DMTS procedure. Performance was significantly above chance in all three experiments, suggesting that both species of Great Ape might be sensitive to abstract concepts such as social relationships and activities...|$|R

Garwin was the author of the actual design used in the first hydrogen bomb (code-named Mike) in 1952. He was assigned the job by Edward Teller, with the instructions that he was to make it as conservative a design as possible in order to prove the concept was feasible. He also worked {{on the development of the}} first spy satellites, for which he was named one of the ten founders of national reconnaissance. While at IBM, his work on spin-echo magnetic resonance laid the foundations for MRI; he was the catalyst for the discovery and publication of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, today a staple of digital signal processing; he worked on gravitational waves; and played a crucial role in the development of laser printers and <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitors.</b> He has been granted 47 patents and has published over 500 papers.|$|R
40|$|Pigeons {{and humans}} searched on a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor</b> for an unmarked goal located {{relative}} to {{an array of}} landmarks presented in varied screen locations. After training with the goal centered in various square arrays of 4 landmarks, humans, but not pigeons, transferred accurately to arrays with novel elements. Humans earched {{in the middle of}} expanded arrays, whereas pigeons preserved the distance and direction to a single landmark. When trained with the goal centered below 2 identical horizontally aligned landmarks, humans responded to horizontal expansions or contractions of the array by shifting their search vertically, preserv-ing angles from landmarks to goal. Pigeons did not adjust their search vertically. Humans trained with a single landmark adjusted search distance when landmark size was changed. Both pigeons and humans use the configuration of a landmark array, but the underlying processes seem to differ. Experimental work has demonstrated that many animal species can encode the location of an important place in terms of nearby visual landmarks (see Gallistel, 1990, and Collett, 1992, for reviews). In several investigations of landmark use, a goal was located near an array of two or more local landmarks, with a directionally stable frame of reference provided by other cues (e. g., Cartwright & Collett...|$|R
40|$|Investigators {{have long}} been {{interested}} in the human propensity for the rapid detection of threatening stimuli. However, until recently, research in this domain has focused almost exclusively on adult participants, completely ignoring the topic of threat detection {{over the course of}} development. One of the biggest reasons for the lack of developmental work in this area is likely the absence of a reliable paradigm that can measure perceptual biases for threat in children. To address this issue, we recently designed a modified visual search paradigm similar to the standard adult paradigm that is appropriate for studying threat detection in preschool-aged participants. Here we describe this new procedure. In the general paradigm, we present participants with matrices of color photographs, and ask them to find and touch a target on the screen. Latency to touch the target is recorded. Using a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor</b> makes the procedure simple and easy, allowing us to collect data in participants ranging from 3 years of age to adults. Thus far, the paradigm has consistently shown that both adults and children detect threatening stimuli (e. g., snakes, spiders, angry/fearful faces) more quickly than neutral stimuli (e. g., flowers, mushrooms, happy/neutral faces). Altogether, this procedure provides an important new tool for researchers interested in studying the development of attentional biases for threat.

40|$|In this study, {{subjects}} in a driving simulator followed a lead vehicle that continuously changed speed while they also performed a secondary task on a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor</b> {{that could be}} located at various positions within the simulator. Subjects were instructed to give priority to the following task. Driving performance in the following task was affected by {{whether or not the}} secondary task was required, but was not affected by the location of the monitor. However, consistent with the instructions about priority of tasks, time to complete the secondary task was strongly influenced by monitor position. Farther locations required more time, especially for shorter subjects. Analysis of the number and timing of glances away from the road suggested that subjects coped with the more difficult monitor positions primarily by making more glances to the monitor, while the average duration of individual glances was not much affected. These results suggest that the subjects’ partial success in coping with the secondary task was possible because the secondary task could be broken down into partially independent subtasks. This study was part of a modeling effort designed to better understand the combined visual and motor demands of secondary tasks, and how they are affected by the design of controls and displays. Various ways in which this study should be extended to support that modeling effort are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} find good {{solutions}} to face the aging problems, a European Union project-MonAMI was established with {{the main purpose of}} enhancing old people’s life by using mainstream technological platforms to deliver helpful services. This thesis project is a sub-project of MonAMI project which focus on design and develop a graphical user interface for a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor</b> that is used to deliver several useful services to old people who live in their home environment. Universal design principles, evaluation results from older prototypes, characteristics are the fundamental design guidelines for the interface design. The development processes have followed both User-Centered Design process and a modified version of task-artifact development life cycle.   The biggest challenge for this thesis was to identify the most perceivable and acceptable design solution for the old user. This means the solution has to be good in both visual and logical way. Therefore, the solution is produced with an incremental progressive procedure. In this procedure, expert evaluation was used as the main method to filter out less perceivable ideas.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is {{computer-based}} planning of a partial organ resection for three dimensional visualisation of anatomical structures and volumetric estimations. Using quantitative parameters for the estimation of the operation risk, the selection of patients can be further objectified. Another important effect of this project is support for surgical interventions by predefinition of different operation scenarios. All preoperative analysis results are based on tomographic images acquired during the clinical routine. In the end, the integration of planning results into the operation theater as well as into the clinical workflow {{is part of this}} project. Surgical strategy is determined by the exact location of the tumor, the respective donor liver part, and the proximity of supporting and draining vessels. Depending on the acquired images, the portal, hepatic, arterial and biliary systems may be analyzed. Therefore, fundamentals for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of images have been developed and implemented {{since the beginning of the}} project. The qualitative aspects are, e. g., the three dimensional visualisation of vessel structures, tumors, the security margin and the organ itself. These were evaluated for use in the clinical routine. Preoperatively, the operation strategy is planned by segmenting the important anatomical structures and defining the different vessel systems using a special operation planning software. The visualisation and volumetric results can be visualised and adapted during surgical intervention with the help of a beamer and a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor</b> installed above the patient.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the influence of emotion on memory processes across the human lifespan. Some results have shown older adults (OA) performing better with positive stimuli, some with negative items, whereas some found no impact of emotional valence. Here we tested, in two independent studies, how younger adults (YA) and OA would perform in a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task with positive, negative, and neutral images. The task consisted of identifying the new location of a stimulus in a crescent set of identical stimuli presented in different locations in a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor.</b> In other words, participants should memorize the locations previously occupied to identify the new location. For each trial, the number of occupied locations increased until 8 or until a mistake was made. In study 1, 56 YA and 38 OA completed the task using images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Results showed that, although YA outperformed OA, no effects of emotion were found. In study 2, 26 YA and 25 OA were tested using facial expressions as stimuli. Data from {{this study showed that}} negative faces facilitated performance and this effect did not differ between age groups. No differences were found between men and women. Taken together, our findings suggest that YA and OA’s VSWM can be influenced by the emotional valence of the information, though this effect was present only for facial stimuli. Presumably, this may have happened due to the social and biological importance of such stimuli, which are more effective in transmitting emotions than IAPS images. Critically, our results also indicate that the mixed findings in the literature about the influence of aging on the interactions between memory and emotion may be caused by the use of different stimuli and methods. This possibility should be kept in mind in future studies about memory and emotion across the lifespan...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{tool for}} {{standardized}} and repeated neuropsychological assessments {{in patients with}} idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is needed. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a computerized neuropsychological test battery designed for INPH and to evaluate its reliability, validity and patient's ability to complete the tests. METHODS: Based on a structured review of the literature on neuropsychological testing in INPH, the eight tests most sensitive to the INPH cognitive profile were implemented in a computerized format. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was also included. Tests were presented on a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor,</b> with animated instructions and speaker sound. The battery was evaluated with the following cohorts: A. Test-retest reliability, 44 healthy elderly; B. Validity against standard pen and pencil testing, 28 patients with various cognitive impairments; C. Ability to complete test battery, defined as completion of at least seven of the eight tests, 40 investigated for INPH. RESULTS: A. All except the figure copy test showed good test-retest reliability, r[*]=[*] 0. 67 - 0. 90; B. A high correlation was seen between conventional and computerized tests (r[*]=[*] 0. 66 - 0. 85) except for delayed recognition and figure copy task; C. Seventy-eight percent completed the computerized battery; Patients diagnosed with INPH (n[*]=[*] 26) performed worse on all tests, including depression score, compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A new computerized neuropsychological test battery designed for patients with communicating hydrocephalus and INPH was introduced. Its reliability, validity for general cognitive impairment and completion rate for INPH was promising. After exclusion of the figure copy task, the battery is ready for clinical evaluation and as a next step we suggest validation for INPH and a comparison before and after shunt surgery.

40|$|We {{examined}} how subjects plan movement sequences in a 'foraging' task involving three disks that appeared simultaneously {{at a small}} number of possible locations on a <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitor.</b> Subjects received monetary rewards for the disks they touched within 1. 6 s. Disk colour signaled the value. The subjects could choose to attempt three disks in any order and could choose to attempt fewer than three disks. The dependent variable was the estimated probability of hitting each disk (pA, pB, pC) as a function of sequence. It might be (0. 9, 0. 6, 0. 5) for sequence ABC but (0. 9, 0, 0. 9) for sequence AC (no attempt to hit B). The sequence ABC offers the higher probability of hitting all three disks but, if A and C are made valuable enough, the sequence AC has higher expected gain. We tested whether subjects planned movement sequences that maximised expected gain. The experiment consisted of three sessions. In the first session, ten naive subjects were trained until their performance was stable. In the second session, we measured how accurately each subject could execute each of the 12 possible sequences of length 2 or 3 on three disks of equal value. In the last session, the values of the disks were altered by amounts that varied between blocks of trials. Subjects were told the values of the colour-coded disks before each block and were free to choose any sequence. On the basis of second-session performance we could predict the strategy each subject should adopt on each trial in order to maximise expected value for each assignment of values to disks. Subjects did change strategies in the expected direction but typically favoured strategies that maximised probability of hitting three disks over the maximum expected gain strateg...|$|R

The woman walks to the door, looks into a hidden camera and says the password, [...] "If". A man operating the door from inside then grants her access to the festivities. The inside of the bordello is then shown as a green light turns on, signaling male dancers to be lowered from the ceiling, who descend upside down on ropes in a winding fashion simulating a corkscrew. The woman is then shown entering the club. A wider view of the club is then revealed, with club patron watching the stage as female dancers perform. Various scenes of people attending the club are shown through <b>touch-screen</b> <b>monitors</b> and web cameras. Multiple screens are shown, and a man watching {{some of the other}} patron on the monitor uses the futuristic touch-screen to select angles of the performance on the main stage. The doors on the main platform then rapidly open as Janet, who is wearing a black and white top, black pants and a Bohemian choker, descends the stairs and enters the main stage, surrounded by blowing red fabric and a radiant white light. She focuses solely on one man in the audience watching her through the monitor as she and her dancers start performing a sexually suggestive dance routine, three women in high fashion outfits are shown walking through the club and observing the men in attendance through a monitor. As Jackson continues entertaining the crowd, the woman who was originally shown entering the bordello is again seen walking through the event, quickly paying one of the guards to allow her into the club's private sector. Jackson continues the routine as additional scenes on a monitor are briefly seen. This leads into the video's choreographed breakdown, with Jackson performing the routine as angles switch multiple times. Jackson continues the intricate dance while a woman is shown touching the image of a man's faces on another screen. Another woman is then shown on a webcam, becoming aroused while observing a couple engaging in sexual activity. The video's final dance sequence begins, with Janet grabbing a male dancer's crotch region and simulating oral sex, before placing him on the floor and bending him over. Janet continues to seductively watch the man in the audience as she performs, kneeling before the male dancer and then lowering him to floor. The video ends with the man in the audience passionately touching an image of Janet on the monitor, as the woman who was shown entering the club is then seen exiting and walking towards the village.|$|R
