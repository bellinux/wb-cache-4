5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E

Edwards was awarded a Harkness Fellowship to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in 1975, and moved over to the Australian National University (ANU) as a Research Fellow in History later that year.

5|$|One of President Garfield's more wearying duties {{was seeing}} office seekers, {{and he saw}} Guiteau at least once. White House {{officials}} suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{known as}} Cann Valley Road, the Victorian section was {{designated}} as a highway in 1960, and received the name Cann Valley Highway.

5|$|The {{open and}} idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's {{immediate}} supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed {{to defend the}} division. Spies <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>department,</b> under the instruction of Mark E. Peterson, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority). In {{a meeting with the}} first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency ahead of time. Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the Ensign, exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the Ensign did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.|$|E
