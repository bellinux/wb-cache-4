5|$|The <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> spiders {{on which}} Portia species prey {{sometimes}} contain dead insects and other arthropods which are uneaten or partly eaten. P. fimbriata (in Queensland) {{and some other}} Portia species such as P. labiata and P. schultzi sometimes scavenge these corpses if the corpses are not obviously decayed.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi, {{along with}} a large variety of spiders and insects, is often found in the dense, large <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> the diplurid Ischnothele karschi (about 15millimetres long), which are {{especially}} abundant in partly cleared secondary bush where rain forests have been cut down, and usually about one metre above the ground. A survey of one area suggested that there is about one P. schultzi per three I. karschi webs. P. schultzi {{is also found in}} its own web and those of other spiders, on tree trunks and the walls of buildings, and in leaf litter.|$|E

5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Geospatial data {{provenance}} records {{sources and}} processing steps {{that are used}} in deriving geospatial data products. In the <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Data environment enabled by Linked Data technologies, sources and processing steps, such as geospatial data and geoprocessing services, can be published as part <b>of</b> the <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Data. To take full advantages of the machine-understandable format and linkages among heterogeneous data items in the <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Data, this paper proposes to publish geospatial data provenance into the <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Data. In particular, it analyzes how a catalogue for provenance, i. e., geospatial data provenance managed by a geospatial metadata catalog service, can be published into the <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Data using a Linked Data approach. Consequently, queries over linked geospatial data provenance are analyzed and tested to demonstrate the benefits of the approach.

25|$|Double-tailed tent spiders build large nonsticky <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> {{two parts}} – a tangle web and a finely-meshed {{horizontal}} orb web. The females {{of the species}} are larger than the males and they may vary considerably in colour. They are easily distinguishable by their shape, the markings on their backs, {{and the way the}} females have the habit of guarding their eggs by splaying their bodies over them.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large size of web, they are often infested with kleptoparasitic split-faced silver spiders (Argyrodes fissifrons). While able to build <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> their own, dewdrop spiders (genus Argyrodes) prefer to live and even reproduce in the <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> other spiders, stealing prey in the process. They can be permanently associated with one web or move around between several other tent webs in the immediate vicinity. The size of the web is directly proportional {{to the number of}} A. fissifrons inhabiting them. The relationships can sometimes be commensal or even mutual, as A. fissifrons eat prey entangled in the webs that are too small for the larger double-tailed tent spiders. However, they often help themselves to food stores or even food {{in the process of being}} consumed by the hosts as well. Larger individuals are more audacious, but they usually stay on the tangle webs and out of the way of their hosts. Double-tailed tent spiders seem to tolerate their presence though they sometimes have to shove them away when they catch larger prey.|$|E

The frequent rebuilding or abandoning of webs by Nephila may be a tactic for controlling Argyrodes.

40|$|A major {{obstacle}} impeding {{progress on the}} “web of data ” is content creation—a difficult, tedious, and timeconsuming task. How do we make human-scalable, user-friendly tools to enable the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> data? Content integrity is also a major concern. How do we engender confidence in results returned from the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> data? Although seemingly unrelated, we show in this paper that it is exactly their relationship {{that is the key}} to solving both problems. As we show in this paper, we can semi-automatically derive both data and metadata from data-rich web pages to create a <b>web</b> <b>of</b> data that we then superimpose over these data-rich web pages. We link the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> data to the current <b>web</b> <b>of</b> pages, resulting in a higher-order “web of knowledge. ” This <b>web</b> <b>of</b> knowledge provides provenance and thus engenders the confidence necessary to raise the level <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> from “data ” to “knowledge. ” We focus mainly on two prototype tools we have implemented: (1) TISP—a tool to automatically generate ontologies for data-rich, machinegenerated web pages and annotate these pages with respect to these generated ontologies and (2) FOCIH—a tool to semi-automatically generate user-specified ontologies and annotate web pages with respect to these user-specified ontologies. We also briefly survey a suite of tools we and others are creating that have the potential to further enable this <b>web</b> <b>of</b> knowledge.
