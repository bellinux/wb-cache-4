She {{is very concerned}} about modern biotechnology, specifically genetic engineering and GM feed crops. She tells Songolo Akakandelwa, why. IN:		?It fundamentally interferes ?? OUT:		??. your own country and the region. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Miriam Mayet was talking to Songolo Akakandelwa. Transcript Mayet	It fundamentally interferes with the way nature reproduces. It is very very different from traditional and conventional biotechnologies. It is a technology owned by multinational corporations. There hasn?t been enough time for adequate safety testing. It has never been tested in humans. It fundamentally impacts on food production systems. It will have far ranging implications on household food security. Aka	Talking about implications, how are these going to impact on these people? Mayet	The first {{thing is that it}} is not a sustainable technology. If you look at Bt cotton for example in South Africa we see that there is pest resistance. Farmers have to spray against the very insects that Bt is supposed to protect the plant against- namely bollworms. And they have two choices. Either they spray their crops or they face wholesale crop failures just to give you one example. When you look at Roundup Ready crops, there?s injudicious use of chemicals. There?s dependence on the same company who supplies the seed ? you have to buy the herbicide that goes with the seed and it has negative environmental implications and the most important thing is that you have weed resistance. So it is not a sustainable technology. It is not an appropriate technology. Aka	Let?s take for instance, the small scale farmers are not scientists in their own right. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>reaction</b> to such situations? Mayet	I just think farmers are caught in the middle. They don?t have political interests. They have food security and economic interests. They have interests to survive. And they want assistance from governments, from the private sector, from NGOs to enable them to increase household food security. And the tragedy here is that quite apart from consumers being at risk, in terms of the negative impacts on human health, farmers will be the losers. Aka	And how has been your experience in S. Africa? Mayet	There has been very rapid introduction of this technology. We have 350, 000 ha planted with GM crops. 179 applications have been granted for field trials. We have no comprehensive balanced policy over the introduction of modern biotechnology into our food production systems. We have a biotechnology strategy that is biased in favour of the biotechnology industry and we have very bad legislation and no labelling of GM food, no segregation of GM crops from non-GM crops. there?s a lot of contamination ? co-mingling. And we have very little public participation. Aka	So in this case, what fears would you see if there is rapid engagement into such type of technology? Mayet	I think that we are going to see a lot of farmers being impoverished in future, long term. Because if you look at the Makatini Flats there?s been a situation where dependency has been created. The farmers are completely and utterly dependent on Monsanto to help them obtain credit, to help them purchase the seed, to help them access the market and it?s not a sustainable way of uplifting farmers. Aka	What lessons do you give to the other member states in the region to ensure such problems are not faced in the other countries? Mayet	The first thing is don?t follow South Africa?s example. They have done very bad laws. Do first, a good policy. The policy should underpin your legislation. You can?t have legislation in isolation or in a vacuum. South Africa did it the other way round. They did the law first and only now the policy is coming. So first do a good comprehensive fair policy taking into account the long term interests of your own country and the region.

40|$|Chinese ways {{of dealing}} with seeming contradictions result in a dialectical or {{compromise}} approach [...] -retaining basic elements of opposing perspectives by seeking a "middle way. " European-American ways, on the other hand, deriving from a lay version of Aristotelian logic, result in a differentiation model that polarizes contradictory perspectives in an effort to determine which fact or position is correct. Empirical studies showed that dialectical thinking is a form of folk wisdom in Chinese culture: Chinese preferred dialectical proverbs containing seeming contradictions more than did Americans. Chinese were also found to prefer dialectical resolutions to social conflicts, and to prefer dialectical arguments over classical Western logical arguments. Furthermore, when two apparently contradictory propositions were presented, Americans polarized their views and Chinese were moderately accepting of both propositions. Origins of these cultural differences and their implications for human reasoning in general are discussed. 3 3 Consider the following statements about recent scientific discoveries: Statement A.

40|$|No rights, no {{compensation}} CUE: Building roads {{can bring}} not only infrastructure but new opportunities to remote and poorly developed areas. However, while roads may bring {{benefits to the}} majority, for the people whose land they cross {{they can be very}} costly, as crops, trees and even buildings are bulldozed. And if people do not have well established rights of ownership, they may not even be compensated for their loss. Mike Davison introduces this report from Cameroon, where such a road building project led to violent protests from local farmers. IN:		?In Babungo village, in North ? OUT:		? are benefiting from the route. DUR?N	 5 ? 11 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Tumoh Emmanuel who, because of having no secure right to his land, received no compensation when a new road was built across it. Transcript Studio	In Babungo village, in North West Cameroon, the right to land is held by the village chief. He?s known as the fon. When a wealthy cattle ranch owner, Alhadji Baba, wanted to build a road to his ranch, he approached the fon, to ask for permission, since the road would have to cross land under the fon?s control. The fon agreed but the road proved to be very controversial, as Martha Chindong found out when she investigated the project. She spoke first to Fuangwe Soweh Christopher. He?d been chosen to manage the road building project. Christopher	The fon authorised me to trace a route. It was not an easy thing. The villagers rebelled against the route, because it was going to destroy their crops, it was going to destroy their trees, in fact it was going to destroy their land. So there was high tension, and may of the villagers carried dangerous weapons, waiting for who will enter his land to trace or dig a route. Chindong	Did you not consult with the people before starting the project, or you just went into their land like that? Christopher	At that time land was not being sold, and the fon is the custodian of all Babungo land, by our tradition. And he had the right to dish out any piece of land, especially for development, to anybody. So it was not necessary to bargain with the people. Chindong	Maybe the people were violent because you did not communicate with them. Those who had crops growing on the land; maybe you did not promise to compensate them in any way. Christopher	It?s true. There was no promise for any compensation. And at that time, we never even thought that if we had asked the people to accept compensation they will accept. Because they did not talk of compensation, but they talked of not allowing anybody to tamper with any piece of their land. And we knew that if we stayed at that stage, development would not come to the village. But I think that the Fon who was custodian of the village had some compensation from Alhadji Baba, and that was on behalf of the people. That is a crucial thing in African society, where the big man enjoys for his subjects. Chindong	And today, how are the people benefiting from this road? Christopher	The whole community, including myself are benefiting from this route, because we transport sick ones through the route, we carry crops from farms to our homes through this route, people are building along the route and can easily have electricity connected to their compounds, whereas it was not easy before. It is easy to transport food to distant villages like Belo and Kom, through this route. So I think that the route has been beneficial to every citizen in Babungo. Studio	While the new road has clearly brought advantages to the people of Babungo, some of those whose crops and trees were destroyed are still unhappy that they received no compensation for their losses. Martha spoke to Tumoh Emmanuel about how the building of the road has affected his livelihood. Emmanuel	The road is passing through my plot, so I lost many mango trees, pear trees, palm trees etc. Chindong	Now tell me when they started the route, before they started the project, did they tell you that this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening, and this is how it is going to affect you? Emmanuel	No. I had no idea of the development, I had no idea. They did not inform us. So we only found that tractors were sent to bulldoze every place. Chindong	<b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>your</b> <b>reactions?</b> Emmanuel	We went out to stop caterpillars. So we had information from the workers, that all that was being done had already been compensated, so we would get our compensation after the construction of the road, which has never come until now. Chindong	Are you regretting that the road cut across your plot? Emmanuel	Yes I am regretting, because the crops that were destroyed, were those crops that we were living through. Chindong	Have you ever benefited anything from this project? Emmanuel	If I can say that I have benefited something from there it is just because gravel was sprayed on the road, so now travelling during rainy season, we have not mud on the way. Chindong	What of selling some items to tourists who pass through this route to Elba ranch? Emmanuel	Some other people who come from other quarters they do sell, but we around the road now, whose trees were destroyed, we have nothing now to sell, so we are just empty. But different people are benefiting from the route. End of tape. Building roads can bring new opportunities to remote and poorly developed areas, but for people whose land they cross, they can be very costly.
