5|$|Claims that {{termites}} emerged earlier {{have faced}} controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner {{indicated that the}} Mastotermitidae termites may {{go back to the}} Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus. The folded <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina, arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1aand 2a, resemble those seen in Mastotermes, the only living insect with the same pattern. Krishna et al., though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{took place}} during the 1990s. The Charter/International Terminal, later renamed Terminal 2, was opened in December 1991 to handle rising international traffic to Las Vegas. An additional, nine-story parking garage and an underground tunnel linking the Las Vegas Beltway to the airport were constructed as well. In June 1998, the southwest and southeast <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the D Gates were opened.|$|E
5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E

50|$|Jami'at al-Zahra {{was founded}} in 1984 to unite several women's seminaries in Qom, {{including}} Maktab-e Ali, Maktab-e Tawhid (the women's <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the Haqqani seminary), and Dar al-Zahra (the women's <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> grand ayatollah Shariatmadari's Dar al-Tabligh), which had all opened in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as in the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|Many {{researchers}} consider {{there to}} be at least two species of Pteranodon. However, aside from the differences between males and females described above, the post-cranial skeletons of Pteranodon show little to no variation between species or specimens, and the bodies and <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> all pteranodonts were essentially identical.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> Lorain High School was {{completed}} in 1916 and dedication exercises were held on May 12 of that year. The second <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the building {{was completed}} in 1917 and the two wings included ninety two rooms, a gymnasium-stage and an auditorium.|$|R

50|$|In a biplane aircraft, two {{wings are}} placed one above the other. Each {{provides}} {{part of the}} lift, although they {{are not able to}} produce twice as much lift as a single <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> similar size and shape because the upper and the lower are working on nearly the same portion of the atmosphere and thus interfere with each other's behaviour. For example, in a <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> aspect ratio 6, and a <b>wing</b> separation distance <b>of</b> one chord length, the biplane configuration will only produce about 20 percent more lift than a single <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the same planform.|$|R
