A Nintendo World Report editorial {{stated that the}} now-removed Flipnote Gallery: Friends feature was not very <b>well</b> <b>put</b> together.

Despite the current lack of Spotpass features, the editorial expressed that Flipnote Studio 3D {{is still a lot}} of fun, and Nintendo should still release the then-delayed application in the West. The stripped-down non-Japanese version of Flipnote Studio 3D was received with mixed reactions.|$|E

Asep Saefudin, writing for Antara, himself a graduate from Muhammadiyah schools, viewed the film as being <b>well</b> <b>put</b> together and reflective of the issues faced by Islamic modernists in the early 1900s. Pramono praised the film's acting, soundtrack, and plot, especially Dahlan's portrayal as a human with emotions and flaws instead of being perfect in every way. He found Sang Pencerah greatest weakness to be the language spoken by in some scenes, as it mixed Indonesian with Javanese (something not done during the period portrayed), and the film's stars– neither of whom is Javanese– had inaccurate accents.|$|E
500|$|While reviewers criticised the styling {{of early}} NAITs {{of having a}} {{distinctly}} cottagey feel, Ian White observed that the typical Naim product is [...] "meticulously laid out, clean, and <b>well</b> <b>put</b> together".

For many years, Holden & Fisher supplied custom-made toroidal transformers used in the amplifiers. The ones used in NAIT were rated 100 VA, but these have been progressively up-rated over the years, with consequent increases in power output: the entry-level [...] has a powerful 300 VA transformer for the delivery of 60 W of rated output.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two wrote that, while [...] "it lacks Vince Gilligan's trademark wit", the episode takes the plot threads started in [...] "Pusher" [...] to their [...] "logical conclusions". Shearman and Pearson explained that the episode's acting, most notably that of Robert Wisden and Diana Scarwid, [...] "helps raise 'Kitsunegari' above the average." [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a C+. He wrote that, despite his love for [...] "Pusher", [...] "'Kitsunegari' isn't anywhere near as good as its predecessor". Handlen cited the change in Modell's personality, his lack {{of a desire to}} kill, and Scully's portrayal as a [...] "humorless scold who only sees the truth when required to for narrative convenience" [...] as reasons why the episode was weak. He concluded that [...] "Kitsunegari" [...] was [...] "not very <b>well</b> <b>put</b> together".|$|E
500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination".

[...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E
500|$|Quatermass and the Pit premiered on 9 November 1967 {{and went}} on general release in a double bill with Circus of Fear on 19 November 1967. It was {{released}} under the title Five Million Years to Earth in the US in March 1968. The critical reception was generally positive. Writing in The Times, John Russell Taylor found that, “After a slowish beginning, which shows up the deficiencies of acting and direction, things really start hopping when a mysterious missile-like object discovered in a London excavation proves to be a relic of a prehistoric Martian attempt (successful, it would seem) to colonize Earth [...] The development of this situation is scrupulously worked out and the film is genuinely gripping even when (a real test this) the Power of Evil is finally shown personified in hazy glowing outline, a spectacle as a rule more likely to provoke titters than gasps of horror.” Paul Errol of the Evening Standard described the film as a “well-made, but wordy, blob of hokum”, a view echoed by William Hall of the Evening News who described the film as [...] "entertaining hokum" [...] with an [...] "imaginative ending". A slightly more critical view was espoused by Penelope Mortimer in The Observer who said, “This nonsense makes quite a good film, <b>well</b> <b>put</b> together, competently photographed, on the whole sturdily performed.

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on March 3, 1911. The Billboards reviewer gave a positive review and asserted, [...] "Any motion picture in which the views of 'back on the stage' are shown possesses {{a certain degree of}} interest. The ever-curious public is fascinated by the alluring stories of the stage world, and any peep it is given into this realm is welcomed. Because of this, Stage Struck derives the interest it has. As far as the story is concerned there is no special recommendation for it. ... The theatre settings are about as faithful depictions of stage scenes as are found in motion pictures. The player portraying the role of the leading actor very much exaggerates in makeup. The photography is very good." [...] Both the The Morning Telegraph and The New York Dramatic Mirror thought the conclusion was impossible turn of events. The Telegraphs reviewer wrote, [...] "An excellent opportunity was sadly missed for the exposition of a strong lesson to the uninitiated girl or boy who dreams of a career before the footlights. How any author or producer could permit such an impossible ending is a wonder. Can any sensible person imagine a New York manager offering an inexperienced amateur a leading part in a Broadway production? Yet this is what occurs in this tale of a stage-struck miss who joins a repertoire company, is stranded, gets home through the generosity of a traveling salesman and then, with no lapse of time or experience noted, receives a letter with such an offer! Most of the play was <b>well</b> <b>put</b> on and ably acted. The 'star' of the theatrical company wore an abominable wig, which could be distinguished as false. More care and thought would have made this an admirable offering." [...] The Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "The production leaves the impression of being exceedingly well done, but to the average actor the New York engagement, after forsaking her barnstorming company of players, seems somewhat of a dream. It was also startling to see her playing Ophelia after such a flat failure at the previous rehearsal where another took her place." [...] According to the synopsis, it is likely that this New York production in which she foresees herself on stage as Ophelia is a dream because it is prompted by the two letters she received at home.|$|E

Cosmo Duff Gordon had been standing on deck {{with his wife and}} her secretary, Miss Laura Mabel Francatelli, watching the launching of three other lifeboats when, as Boat 1 was being prepared, he asked Murdoch if his party could board. Murdoch assented and also allowed two Americans, Abram Salomon and Charles E. H. Stengel, to enter. He then instructed a group of six stokers to board, along with Lookout Symons, whom he placed in charge of the boat. As the craft was lowered, Greaser Walter Hurst, watching the procedure from a lower deck, remarked to a crewmate: [...] "If they are sending the boats away they might as <b>well</b> <b>put</b> some people in them." ...|$|E

Hill says that Bogdanovich was interested in making the film a more Hitchcock-type movie. They had completed 25 pages when they went back to L.A., whereupon McQueen fired Bogdanovich without reading any of their work. Sam Peckinpah came on to direct; Hill started from scratch and wrote his own script in six weeks. The resulting movie was a big hit which Hill later described [...] "of the films I wrote, I thought it was far and away the best one, and most interesting."
