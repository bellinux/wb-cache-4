25|$|From the {{correspondence}} with his close friends of May 1931 {{it appears that}} Ehrenfest suffered from severe depression. By August 1932, Einstein <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that he wrote to the Board of the University of Leiden, expressing deep concern and suggesting ways in which Ehrenfest's workload could be reduced.|$|E
25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E

500|$|Neighbors in Evergreen Park later {{described}} the Kaczynskis as [...] "civic-minded folks", one {{stating that the}} parents [...] "sacrificed everything they had for their children". Both Ted and David were intelligent, but Ted stood out in particular. One neighbor said she had [...] "never known anyone who had a brain like ," [...] while another commented that Ted was [...] "strictly a loner" [...] who [...] "didn't play... an old man before his time." [...] Wanda recalled Ted as a shy child who would become unresponsive if pressured into a social situation. At one point she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about Ted's social development that she considered entering him in a study for autistic children led by Bruno Bettelheim, but decided against it after observing Bettelheim's abrupt and cold manner.|$|E
500|$|Partially {{due to her}} {{experiences}} filming Mermaids, Cher turned down leading roles in such films as The War of the Roses and Thelma & Louise. According to Berman, [...] "After the success of Moonstruck, she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about her next career move that she was overly cautious." [...] In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was not healthy enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10million in fees. The skits were parodied on Saturday Night Live and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told Ladies' Home Journal, [...] "Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't occur to me that people would focus on that and strip me of all my other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Abra, {{aided by}} a {{returned}} Ric, {{decided to go ahead}} with the operations anyway, and secured the use of Kellar theatre at night from Clifford. [...] However, events come to a head when they received a charity patient in episode [...] "Duty of Care" [...] chaperoned by Abra's father, Cecil. [...] Having previously told Kyla his father was dead, Abra attempted to hide his identity from her, but she was furious to discover the truth. He placated her briefly, but <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> when his father collapsed with ill-health that he ruined a social services meeting to decide whether her son may be returned from foster care. [...] They rowed bitterly, and soon thereafter Abra's father died. [...] He decided to take over the running of the charity in his father's place, and once more departed from Holby, again leaving Kyla behind. When asked whether the two characters would ever get back together, following Abra's second abandoment, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." ...|$|E

500|$|Designer Robert Fletcher {{was brought}} in to {{redesign}} existing costumes and create new ones. Fletcher decided on a scheme of [...] "corrupt colors", using materials with colors slightly off from the pure color. [...] "They're not colors you see today, so in a subtle way their indicate another time." [...] Meyer did not like the Starfleet uniforms from either the television series or The Motion Picture and wanted them changed, but for budgetary reasons they could not be discarded entirely. Dye tests of the fabric showed that the old uniforms took three colors well: blue-gray, gold, and dark red. Fletcher decided to use the dark red due to the strong contrast it provided with the background. The resulting naval-inspired designs would be used in Star Trek films until [...] (1996). The first versions of the uniforms had stiff black collars, but Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck, using a form of vertical quilting called trapunto. The method creates a bas-relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with soft thread shot via air pressure through a hollow needle. By the time of The Wrath of Khans production, the machines and needles needed to produce trapunto were rare, and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department. The crew <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about losing or breaking the needle that one of the department's workers took it home with him as a security measure, leading Fletcher to think it had been stolen.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Capp also lampooned popular {{recording}} idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley ("Hawg McCall," [...] 1957), Liberace ("Loverboynik," [...] 1956), the Beatles ("the Beasties," [...] 1964)—and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. [...] "Sinatra was {{the first}} great public figure I ever wrote about," [...] Capp once said. [...] "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about what his reaction might be, {{and we were all}} surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always {{made it a point to}} send me champagne whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant..." [...] (from Frank Sinatra, My Father by Nancy Sinatra, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was [...] "cut to the quick" [...] over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action—as would Joan Baez later, over [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] in 1967.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> {{over the}} confounded business, that I {{have given up}} going to some friends as I had promised, as I didn't feel that I could talk about {{indifferent}} matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{hope you}} won't mind my being frank--I've <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried.</b> It's an unhappy position, isn't it?" [...] Gyp did not answer, and she hurried on. [...] "If there's {{anything}} I {{can do to}} help, I should <b>be</b> <b>so</b> glad--it must <b>be</b> horrid for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> lately, I can't help croaking. I {{wonder what}} Dan thought at not seeing you again? It was wise; {{but he would}} have enjoyed another look at home faces before he went into the wilderness,' said Mrs Jo regretfully.|$|R
2500|$|Kramer {{has written}} that he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that Rosewall would offer no {{competition}} to Gonzales and would thereby destroy the financial success of the tour that, for {{the only time in}} his career as a player or promoter, he asked Gonzales while in Australia to [...] "carry" [...] Rosewall in return for having his share of the gross receipts raised from 20 percent to 25 percent. Gonzales reluctantly agreed. After 4 matches, with Gonzales ahead 3 to 1, Gonzales came to Kramer to say that [...] "I can't play when I'm thinking about trying to carry the kid. I can't concentrate. It just bothers me too much." [...] By this time, however, it was apparent that Rosewall would be fully competitive with Gonzales, so Kramer told Gonzales to return to his normal game — and that he could keep his additional 5 percent.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, declassified {{documents}} {{revealed that}} the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973. [...] Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger {{had told him that}} [...] "it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force." [...] British Prime Minister Edward Heath <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions, which concluded America [...] "might consider it could not tolerate {{a situation in which the}} U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries," [...] and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon. [...] Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned [...] "the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the ‘total alienation’ of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World." ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix {{converted}} a wing of his Moika Palace into {{a hospital}} for wounded soldiers but avoided entering military service himself {{by taking advantage of}} a law exempting only-sons from serving in the war. He entered the Cadet Corps and took an officer's training course but had no intention of joining a regiment. Irina's first cousin, Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna, to whom she had been close when they were girls, was disdainful of Felix: [...] "Felix is a 'downright civilian,' dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes—a man idling in such times," [...] Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas II, on 5 March 1915 after paying a visit to the Yusupovs. Felix and Irina's only daughter, Princess Irina Felixovna Yusupova, nicknamed [...] "Bebé", was born on 21 March 1915. [...] "I shall never forget my happiness when I heard the child's first cry," [...] her father wrote. Irina liked her name and wanted to pass it on to her first child. Her mother Xenia <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> over the delivery that Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna said it was almost like Xenia was giving birth instead of Irina.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, papa," [...] {{she cried}} in French, [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about her, mamma and I. It {{was the day}} you went away, the day these gentlemen came, that we thought she would take an airing. And {{suddenly}} she became worse." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the {{packages}} of films were locked {{away in a}} storeroom shortly before an official inspection visit. On other occasions, patients' x-ray films were hidden or rather locked in the car boots of consultants because they <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> they would go missing.|$|R
60|$|Then Sticky-toes {{poured out}} all his {{troubles}} to Peter Rabbit. They {{were very much}} like the troubles of Sammy Jay. Every night Sticky-toes would hear what sounded like his own voice coming from a tree in which he was not sitting at all, {{and at a time when}} he was keeping his mouth shut as tight as he knew how. In fact, he had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that for several nights he hadn't said a word, yet his neighbors had complained that he had been very noisy. He <b>was</b> getting <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that he couldn't eat.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?".|$|E
60|$|Not for long, though. Jean d'Estivet {{could not}} hold still, he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> and angry about the {{suspicion}} of poisoning which Joan had hinted at; so he came back {{in the evening and}} stormed at her till he brought the fever all back again.|$|E
6000|$|Whether he or Mr. Mortimer R. Guilfogle was {{the more}} aghast at hearing him bawl this no one knows. The manager <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> {{at the thought of}} {{breaking}} in a new man that his eye-glasses slipped off his poor perspiring nose. He begged, in sudden tones of old friendship: ...|$|E
50|$|Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot! She is a {{bad person}} and must pay the penalty... Do you think this scene should have been cut?

6000|$|... "I wouldn't try to {{ride that}} beast {{for a million}} dollars," [...] was Phil's comment. [...] "When he went off with you I thought you'd never get back to tell the story.

Gee! me, I couldn't sleep one wink if I thought you was offended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When Mrs. Gobbler returned, she did {{miss that}} egg. She looked all about for it, {{but there was}} nothing to show what had become of it. With a troubled mind she began to sit on her eggs. She <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that she didn't leave them until she simply had to get {{something}} to eat.|$|E
6000|$|Trot couldn't sleep, either, she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> over Cap'n Bill. She {{went back}} to the tent where Rosalie and Button-Bright were sitting in the {{moonlight}} and asked the Witch if there was no way in which she could secretly get into the City of the Blues and search for her friend. Rosalie thought it over for some time and then replied: ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne protested. She {{was willing}} to go and do the talking; but she must have others with her [...] "for moral support." [...] Diana and Jane were {{therefore}} appointed to support her morally and the Improvers broke up, buzzing like angry bees with indignation. Anne <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that she didn't sleep until nearly morning, and then she dreamed that the trustees had put a fence around the school and painted [...] "Try Purple Pills" [...] all over it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{tried to}} dodge Ross and the Frenchman by spells of nursing me. They also {{came over to}} help nurse. This {{combination}} aroused such a natural state of invalid cussedness on my part {{that they were all}} forced to retire.

50|$|After {{they had}} {{migrated}} to Sebuyau, Senabong’s men again raided Bangkit {{but this time}} {{with the assistance of the}} Sebuyau people.
