In this study, {{we present a}} technique for encapsulating aqueous drops in a modified calcium alginate membrane made from an emulsion of silicone oil and aqueous alginate solution and explore {{its effect on the}} loss of water from the capsule cores. The capsule membrane storage modulus increases as the initial concentration of oil in the emulsion is increased. The <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of the fabricated capsules were determined by observing the mass loss of capsules in a controlled environment. It was found that capsules made with emulsions containing 50 wt% silicone oil were robust while taking at least twice the time to dry completely as compared to capsules made from only an aqueous alginate solution. The size of the oil droplets in the emulsion also has an effect on the <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of the fabricated capsules.

30|$|For water {{activity}} (Fig. 1 b), fried shrimp cracker {{covered with}} EF showed lower water activity than those covered with GF during 3 – 9  days of storage (p <  0.05). Initial water activity of fried crackers was 0.22. Much lower water activity {{was also found}} in sample packaged with nylon/LLDPE film throughout the 15  days of storage (p <  0.05). The result indicated that <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film was {{lower than that of}} nylon/LLDPE film. Generally, <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film was poorer than that of other biopolymer films, especially for non-hydrophilic material or synthetic polymer, due to the hydrophilic nature of gelatin and hydrophilic plasticiser required for film preparation (Limpisophon et al. 2009). The increase in moisture content and water activity of fried shrimp cracker was due to the diffusion of water vapour from the surrounding atmosphere through the packaging material. Generally, the incorporation of hydrophobic substances such as oil improved the <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film (Tongnuanchan et al. 2015). Therefore, the incorporation of palm oil could improve the <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film, as evidenced by the lower moisture content and water activity of fried shrimp cracker during the storage. Amongst all samples, that stored in air (without film covering) had the higher moisture content and water activity. Therefore, films, either synthetic or gelatin films, were able to serve as the <b>barrier</b> against <b>water</b> vapour migration, in which the quality changes of cracker could be retarded.|$|R

Ts) are {{a special}} class of materials which generated significant interest since they demonstrated {{the combination of}} the anisotropic physical properties of the mesophase and the specific properties of thennosets. Among them, the <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of LeTs makes them very promismg materials for the potential applications in electronics and coatings. Liquid crystalline monomer, 4, 4 '-diglycidyloxy-a-methylstilbene (DOMS), was synthesized and cured with different crosslinking agents, such as sulphanilamide, diaminodiphenylsulfone, diaminodiphenylmethane, and 2, 4 -Diaminotoluene. LeTs with different liquid crystalline structures were produced and their structural, dynamic mechanical and permeability properties are characterised. The conventional epoxy monomer, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (BADGE) is also involved in our study and resins formed by BADGE and curing agents are used as comparisons to the DOMS LeT systems. Polarized optical microscopic tests were used to form time-temperature-transition (TTT) diagrams for different systems, which provide important information about the curing process of Lf. Ts. Relationships between curing conditions, structure and properties are created by TTT diagrams and microscopic observations. Differential scanning calorimetry and wide angle X-ray scattering tests demonstrated the typical smectic features of LeTs systems. In the dynamic vapour sorption tests, the extraordinary <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of smectic LeT is revealed. The water permeability of LeT was reduced by 74. 6 % at 65 'C and by 63. 7 % at 85 'C in comparison with the conventional thermoset. Smectic Le structure was proven useful in reducing the water permeation in epoxy thennosets. Dynamic mechanical analysis combined with computer modelling was employed to investigate the correlation between water permeation and inner structure of materials to clarify the mechanism of moisture diffusion and sorption in LCTs.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of {{the simultaneous}} incorpo-ration of nanoclay (bentonite) and cellulose fibers on the mechanical and <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of the resultant composite-films. Films were prepared by casting with 3 % in weight of cassava starch, using glycerol as plasticizer (0. 30 g per g of starch), cellulose fibers at a concentration of 0. 30 g of fibers per g of starch and nanoclay (0. 05 g clay per g starch and 0. 10 g clay per g starch). The addition of cellulose fibers and nanoclay increased the tensile strength of the films 8. 5 times and the Young modulus 24 times but reduced the elongation capacity 14 times. The <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of the composite-films to which bentonite and cellulose fibers were added were approximately 60 % inferior to those of starch films.

Gluten based edible films are characterised by good mechanical and gas <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> but poor <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>properties.</b> Process conditions influence final film structure and performances. In particular, heating treatment is supposed to improve protein reticulation. In this study, different temperatures from 30 ° to 85 °C were used to prepare film forming dispersions {{with the aim of}} studying the influence of temperature on mechanical and <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of edible films.

Size Exclusion-HPLC was performed to study the effect of temperature dispersion on molecular properties of gluten based films. Protein size distribution seemed not to change when dispersion temperature increased, suggesting the absence of modifications in protein chains. Therefore, the different behaviours observed for film prepared at different temperature are not due to changes in gluten fraction on the basis of molecular weight. Probably, heating leads to a more homogeneous gluten network caused by the protein unfolding, to the increase in hydrophobic interactions and a better plasticizer distribution...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable edible {{films are}} both {{economically}} and environmentally {{important to the}} food industry as packaging and coating materials, as the industry seeks to find a replacement to traditional petroleum-derived synthetic polymers. The overall goal of this thesis was to design a canola protein isolate (CPI) -based biodegradable and edible film that provides excellent mechanical, optical and <b>water</b> vapor <b>barrier</b> <b>properties.</b> A {{better understanding of the}} potential of CPI for use as a film-forming ingredient could lead to enhanced utilization and value of the protein for food and non-food applications. In study one, the mechanical, optical and <b>water</b> vapor <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of CPI-based films were investigated as a function of protein (5. 0 % and 7. 5 % w/w) and glycerol (30 %, 35 %, 40 %, 45 %, and 50 % w/w of CPI) concentrations. Overall, as the glycerol concentration increased for the 5. 0 % and 7. 5 % CPI-based films, mechanical strength and flexibility decreased and increased, respectively. Film strength was also found to increase at the higher protein concentration; however corresponding changes to film flexibility differed depending on the testing method used. For instance, puncture deformation testing indicated that film flexibility was reduced as the CPI concentration was raised, whereas tensile elongation testing indicated no change in extensibility between the two CPI concentrations. Film transparency was found to increase with increasing levels of glycerol and decreasing levels of CPI, whereas water vapor permeability was found to increase with increasing levels of both glycerol and protein. In study two, mechanical, optical and vapor <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of CPI-based films were evaluated as a function of plasticizer-type (50 % (w/w of CPI), glycerol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG- 400)) and fixative condition (0 % and 1 % (w/w of CPI), genipin). CPI films prepared with sorbitol were significantly stronger than films with PEG- 400, followed by films with glycerol, whereas the flexibility of CPI-based films with glycerol was higher than films with PEG- 400, followed by films with sorbitol. In all cases, films prepared with genipin were stronger and less malleable than un-cross linked films. CPI films with glycerol were more transparent than films with sorbitol, followed by films with PEG- 400, and the addition of genipin significantly increased the opacity of CPI films. CPI films prepared with glycerol also showed poorer <b>water</b> vapor <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> than films with PEG- 400, followed by films with sorbitol, however, no differences were observed in the presence and absence of genipin. In summary, as the plasticizer concentration increased or protein concentration decreased, CPI films became weaker, more flexible and clearer; however their <b>water</b> vapor <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> became poorer as both plasticizer and protein concentration increased. Moreover, CPI films with sorbitol and genipin were found to be stronger, less malleable and permeable to moisture than CPI films with or without genipin, and in the presence of glycerol or PEG- 400. Overall, CPI could be considered as a potential material for the development of biodegradable edible packaging in the future...|$|R

S-PVA blend films were much more extensible and stable during storage, with improved <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> and reduced water sorption capacity especially when the S:PVA ratio were 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. Starch-poly(vinyl alcohol) blend films are environmentally friendly, low cost materials, with good functional properties. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{moisture}} <b>barrier</b> {{and physical}} <b>properties</b> of bilayer films prepared by lamination of starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum (dHG) and surfactant layers were investigated. It {{was found that}} the water vapor permeability (WVP) of tapioca starch/dHG film (1. 31 x 10 (- 10) g/m s Pa) pronouncedly decreased by the aid of a surfactant layer lamination (1. 36 - 5. 25 x 10 (- 12) g/m s Pa). The WVP of bilayer film increased with increasing the concentration of starch/dHG in the surfactant layer, but was not significantly influenced when it was thickened. The sorption isotherms of both monolayer and bilayer films made from starch/dHG showed typical behavior of water-vapor-sensitive hydrophilic biopolymers. However, the equilibrium moisture content of the monolayer film was significantly higher than that of bilayer films when water activity (a(w)) reaches 0. 33. Both the tensile and puncture force of starch/dHG films did not vary significantly by laminating a surfactant layer, indicating the mechanical strength of surfactant layer is relatively weak, and this surfactant layer mainly served as a barrier for moisture. When compared to emulsion-based starch/dHG films with surfactant, the surfactant laminated starch/dHG films showed higher <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>property,</b> mechanical strength, and transparency.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the results of}} a number of tests. Tested were the basic application properties of blends from thermoplasticized wheat starch (TPWS) and poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) in different mixtures stored at different humidities for up to two months. It was shown that important improvements in the <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>properties,</b> the tensile-stretching behaviour and the aging embrittlement are only possible for a PCL percentage of 50 per cent. But these are accompanied by increased oxygen permeability. The results stand in contrast with properties of commercially available starch/PCL basis film material which have obviously shown better properties by using biologically non-degradable synthetic thermoplastics...|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} focuses on {{fundamental}} investigations regarding the <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of grafted PVOH layers {{produced by the}} Transfer Method. The layers (or papers) used for the different experiments were produced and grafted {{during the course of}} this work. Papers with different types of PVOH (different Mowiol types) were produced by coating. Experiments using different parameters (temperature, reaction duration, and concentration) were performed using the Transfer Method. Contact angle measurements and Cobb 60 measurements were carried out on the grafted and untreated PVOH layers. Furthermore, the water vapour transmission rate of the PVOH layers was determined. The results of this work showed that the method of chromatogeny or chromatogenic chemistry improves the <b>water</b> vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of grafted PVOH layers enormously...|$|R
