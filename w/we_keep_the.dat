500|$|The reappearance of Nick Lane and his storyline helped resolve {{an earlier}} plot point from [...] "Over There," [...] {{in which he}} was {{recognized}} by Fringe agent Lincoln Lee before dying. Noble noted that [...] "Worlds Apart' {{and the rest of the}} fourth season brought back a number of characters from the series' [...] "rich history", including Sally, Nick, and David Robert Jones. [...] "This episode," [...] he commented, [...] "is bringing those things back together for us as we face the decision of what to do. Do <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> worlds together? How do we keep them together without creating the monster that is happening? How do we stop this monster from happening? That’s what this is all about." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E

500|$|There were, however, some {{mixed reviews}} of [...] "Best Mistake". Idolator's Kathy Iandoli {{described}} it as [...] "the average looking cousin of their previous duet [...] "Right There"". Reviewing for Slant Magazine, Andrew Chan said it [...] "makes the mistake of hemming her into her frail middle register, where she has a habit of delivering every word {{as if it were}} a pout." [...] Big Sean's appearance on [...] "Best Mistake" [...] also got varied reception. Pitchfork Media's Meaghan Garvey said his rap on the track made [...] "a mockery of the song's serious tone with hysterically awful lines like [...] "How can <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> feelings fresh/ How do we Ziploc it?"" [...] Lipshutz found his verse [...] "unnecessary, yet [...] has morphed into an interesting confessional now that the dating rumors are on." [...] Sawdey called it a [...] "pretty outstanding verse," [...] with [...] "his own voice never overpowering the sparse atmosphere, his rhymes measured and metered in a way that fits the song perfectly", while James Shotwell of Under the Gun Review said [...] "Grande is a treat, but I think it's Big Sean who steals the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 8 December 1983, the House Standing Committee on Expenditure tabled {{its report}} on the inquiry into lightstations {{entitled}} [...] "Lighthouses: Do <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> keepers?". The report recommended the demanning of 24 lightstation, including Cape Capricorn. In 1988 the station was finally converted to solar power (and presumably demanned).

Ownership of the station {{was transferred to the}} Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in 1991, back to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in 1995 and then to the Queensland Government in July 1997, which employs a caretaker at one of the residences.
