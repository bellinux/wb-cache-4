Downes said that he used five synthesizers in making The Age of Plastic, which were used to [...] "fake up things and to provide effects we won’t use them in the manner that somebody like John Foxx does." [...] According to Horn: [...] "We used about three different drummers including one from Landscape and Johnny Richardson from The Rubettes, who’s really good. We also used the occasional session guitarist to play various bits and there were three or four girl singers involved. Apart from that, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> ourselves." [...] Downes claimed of using George Shearing's trick of doubling melody lines in block chords very heavily on some of the songs.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} the album are noted for their {{changing}} dynamics – with [...] "middle sections [...] turn into this mass orchestrated swarm and ridiculous time signatures" [...] which include musical references to 1970s soft rock bands such as Wings, Eagles and Bread - summed by Hawkins by saying the band [...] "wanted {{to make sure that}} everything 'built' on this record, that each instrument started somewhere and went somewhere else {{in the course of a}} song". The drummer attributed this to the acoustic tour leading the band to [...] "shed some of the fear of incorporating mellower stuff with the heavy stuff", and Grohl added that [...] "we wanted the stops to be pin-drop silent before exploding. If we had a beautiful melody, we'd throw a fucking string quartet in there. So <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> we could to really magnify all those elements and that was fun. Usually you have a few parameters you're afraid to pass but, this time, there was no fear of going too far." [...] Mix engineer Rich Costey added that his work ...|$|E

In September 2009 a team of six British Transport Police officers with specialist training in forensic search techniques spent two days examining the area {{in an attempt to}} recover the jewellery. Although the ground had been the subject of extensive redevelopment in previous years and recovery of the items was considered unlikely, detectives authorised the operation to ensure every attempt had been made to find and return them to her parents. None of the items was discovered. DCI McTavish said of the search: [...] "It is recognised that in the years since Teresa's murder {{there has been a lot}} of disturbance and redevelopment around the railway track, but there was still a possibility that items may have lain undisturbed. Although we have not been able to recover any items linked to either Teresa or the suspect it was important <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> to explore this final aspect of the case." ...|$|E

500|$|In May, Benfica had {{two games}} in which to {{overcome}} a four-point deficit. On the fourth, they played Estrela da Amadora away. Benfica never beat Estrela's goalkeeper, Pedro Alves, drawing 0–0 and losing crucial points. Chalana said, [...] "We started the first half somewhat nervous. Not playing our best. However, the second half was different, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> to win, created opportunities but the ball just would not go in." [...] The draw left Benfica dependent on others to reach second place; even if they won, Sporting had to lose and Guimarães had to lose or draw. On 11 May, the club hosted Vitória de Setúbal. The match, attracting over 54,000 fans for Rui Costa's last game, was a 3–0 Benfica win. Sporting and Guimarães also won and Benfica finished fourth, missing a Champions League berth. It was their fifth finish outside the top three after fourth-place finishes in 1939–40, 1940–41 and 2001–02 and a sixth-place finish in 2000–01. Chalana said, [...] "Benfica is very big. We failed to reach our objectives, but nearly sold out the stadium today." [...] The club's season ended with an African tour in which they defeated a team with players from Sal and São Vicente on 17 May and the Angolan national team two days later.|$|E
500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way {{you can get away with}} a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach." ...|$|E
500|$|Benfica began March {{competing}} {{at three}} levels: the Primeira Liga, the Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Cup. Their first game {{was at the}} Estádio José Alvalade against Sporting CP. Managed by Paulo Bento, the hosts scored the opening goal in the 11th minute with a header by Simon Vukčević. In the 40th minute, Rui Costa's corner kick allowed Cardozo to head in the tying goal. Benfica held second place, five points ahead of Sporting. For Camacho, the result was [...] "very important because we kept our advantage, allowing us to remain in second place". The following Thursday, Benfica hosted Getafe in the UEFA Cup. The match quickly soured for the club when Cardozo was sent off in the ninth minute, and Rubén de la Red scored Getafe's first goal in the 25th minute. During the second half Pablo Hernández added another, and Mantorras scored a 76th-minute consolation goal for Benfica. Camacho said, [...] "We started poorly because Getafe has a good team. With Cardozo's ejection, things got more complicated. In the second half, Benfica was better, the players fought and showed {{we have a chance}} to eliminate them." [...] On 9 March, Benfica hosted União de Leiria. They conceded an opening goal in the 42th minute, scoring two second-half goals in five minutes: one each by Zoro and Cardozo. Serge N'Gal scored a 69th-minute equaliser for the draw. The result had repercussions, as Camacho resigned: [...] "I cannot do anything else to improve this team's performance." [...] His resignation, so late in the season, caught Benfica's management by surprise. They opted to not replace him, nominating his assistant Fernando Chalana as manager. Chalana accepted the challenge: [...] "I am here through thick and thin." [...] His first game as manager was against Getafe on the road on 12 March. Benfica had to score two and allow none to progress; Makukula hit the post in the sixth minute, and Getafe qualified with a 77th-minute goal by Juan Ángel Albín. Four days later, Benfica played Marítimo at Barreiros, with Cardozo scoring his 19th goal of the season in the 26th minute. In the second half, Ytalo scored a 75th-minute equaliser for Marítimo. Chalana said, [...] "We had a great first half. We dominated and honestly I was not expecting Marítimo's goal. I was sad with the way it appeared. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> to win." [...] The fourth consecutive draw cost Benfica their lead over Vitória de Guimarães for second place. Back from international break, the club hosted Paços de Ferreira on 30 March in a 4–1 win. At half-time, the score was 1–1, but Cardozo and Rui Costa's second-half goals gave Benfica their first domestic win in March.|$|E

Price defended his position on this issue in a 2012 interview, by suggesting {{that there are no}} women in the country who have ever struggled to pay for birth control. He said, [...] "Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one. There's not one." [...] Numerous media outlets have refuted this assertion. In 2017, during his confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Health and Human Services, Price was questioned about this comment and responded, [...] ""What I meant is that when I had patients in my office who could not afford a medication <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> we could to make sure they could have it.

The noble lines of the hills to the west, the weeds of the road-side, the dusty weather-beaten, covered-bridges, the workmen in the fields, the voices of our neighbors, the gossip of the village--all these sights and sounds awakened deep-laid, associated tender memories. The cadence of every song, the quality of every resounding jest made us at home, once and for all. Our twenty-five-year stay on the level lands of Iowa and Dakota seemed only an unsuccessful family exploration--our life in the city merely a business, winter adventure.|$|E
