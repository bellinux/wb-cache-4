50|$|Pontiac is {{the first}} inland city of Michigan. The Pontiac Company plotted it in 1818 where the Saginaw Indian Trail (Woodward Avenue) crossed the Schiawassee Indian Trail (Orchard Lake Road). The Clinton River created double {{peninsula}} where it <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> what would become downtown Pontiac. The Pontiac Commercial Historic District is located just north of where the Saginaw Trail crossed the Clinton River. Historically, the business district of Pontiac was centered {{at the intersection of}} Pike and Saginaw.|$|R

It <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> dark, deep valleys, climbed {{high mountain}} ranges and lengthy mountain passes, crossed great rivers and inhospitable rain forests. On 22 June 1942, {{the work of}} laying the railways began from Kanchanapuri, about 80 km away from Thailand’s capital Bangkok and Thanbyuzayat about 55 miles away from Moulmein, a major city of south Burma. About 60,000 prisoners of war of Allied Forces guided by 12,000 Japanese engineers, began the work of laying the railway line for about 415 km.|$|R
5000|$|The Post Road {{followed}} the original the Wickquasgeck Trail, {{carved into the}} brush of Manhattan by its Native American inhabitants. This trail originally <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> swamps and rocks {{along the length of}} Manhattan Island. Upon the arrival of the Dutch, the trail soon became the main road through the island from Nieuw Amsterdam at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur David Pietersz. de Vries gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 ("the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily"). The Dutch named the road [...] "Heerestraat".|$|R

Tents housing displays of works of fine art <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> the walkways of the Public Garden. Across the street on the Common, an outdoor stage featured a variety of performances—free to the public—ranging from classical and popular concerts to performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas by Martyn Green's company. The Festival drew {{hundreds of thousands of}} people, but in the mid-1960s organizers announced a year's [...] "break" [...] to reassess finances, and the earlier version of the Festival never returned.|$|R
50|$|Pikeville, Kentucky was the {{location}} {{of one of the}} biggest Model Cities projects. The Pikeville Cut-Through is 1,300 feet (0.40 km) wide, 3,700 feet (1.1 km) long, and is 523 feet (0.159 km) deep. The project was completed in 1987 following 14 years of work at a cost of $77.6 million. The cut-through provides a path for a four-lane highway, a CSX railroad line, and the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, which <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> the downtown area, to eliminate almost yearly flooding. The river bed then was reclaimed by depositing fill from the cut-through into the old riverbed, significantly increasing the available space for development within the city.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{there was}} little {{building}} associated with settlement, one major engineering project in the early 17th century did impact on the area. Between 1609 and 1613, Sir Hugh Myddleton constructed the New River. This ambitious project was designed to bring fresh water from Hertfordshire into London. Many landowners along its 38-mile length objected to its construction fearing, amongst other things, a drop in land value. In its early form, some of the stretch which <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> Harringay was constructed in wooden aqueducts lined with lead and supported by strong timbers and brick piers. Improvements in canal making in the 18th century led to these sections being replaced with clay-banked canals.|$|R
5|$|Operation Igloo White was {{a covert}} United States joint {{military}} electronic warfare operation conducted from late January 1968 until February 1973, during the Vietnam War. These missions {{were carried out}} by the 553d Reconnaissance Wing, a U.S. Air Force unit flying modified EC-121R Warning Star aircraft, and VO-67, a specialized U.S. Navy unit flying highly modified OP-2E Neptune aircraft. This state-of-the-art operation utilized electronic sensors, computers, and communications relay aircraft in an attempt to automate intelligence collection. The system would then assist in the direction of strike aircraft to their targets. The objective of those attacks was the logistical system of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) that <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> southeastern Laos and was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese).|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the site is {{surrounded}} by two concentric walls which served as defense against attack. There were many smaller walls that <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> the city as well. The inner wall encompasses an area of 9.55 ha. The carved stone of the inner wall, 2 m tall and 3 m wide, is covered in plaster; the outer wall serves purely for defense, as it is less substantial and less decorative. These walls were {{the largest in the}} Late Classic Yucatan, and seem to have a symbolic meaning of protection and military strength. Theories claiming a hasty desertion of the city are backed up by the fourth wall inside the city, which “bisects the Great Plaza, and, at less than a meter wide and made of poorly constructed rubble, it was clearly built as a last ditch effort at protection” against invading attackers.|$|R

50|$|The British, American, French, German, Japanese, and Russian {{military}} guards each took {{responsibility for}} the defense of their respective legations. The Austrians and Italians abandoned their isolated legations, joining the French and the Japanese, respectively. The Japanese and Italian force established defense lines in the Fu - a large palace and park where most of the estimated 2,800 Chinese Christians taking refuge were housed. The American and German marines held positions on the Tartar Wall behind their legations. The 409 guards had the job of defending a line that <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> 2176 yd of urban terrain. The great majority of foreign civilians took refuge in the British Embassy, the largest and most defensible of the diplomatic legations. A census of civilians counted 473 people: 245 men, 149 women, and 79 children. About 150 of the men volunteered to participate, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, in the defense. The civilians included at least 19 nationalities of which British and Americans were the most numerous. Large numbers of Chinese Christians were conscripted for labor, especially for building barricades.|$|R

25|$|On 13 November, Saint-Cyr's host {{stumbled}} into Vidreres which {{was near the}} coast road that led to Malgrat de Mar, Mataró, and Barcelona.

But Saint-Cyr knew of a secret path from a Perpignan smuggler; the route connected the coast road with the inland road. Several search parties that were sent out to find the path during the 14th failed to locate it, so Saint-Cyr personally set out with a small escort to find it. In this he was successful, though the group was nearly captured by guerillas and had to fight its way clear. On the 15th the entire Franco-Italian army <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> the hills, bypassing the small fortress of Hostalric and reaching the inland road at Sant Celoni. At the latter place the Imperial troops scattered a force of miquelets under Milans. Though his men were tired, Saint-Cyr hustled his soldiers along the highway until they reached the dangerous Trentapassos defile which was found to be unoccupied. That evening the Franco-Italians could see a line of campfires ahead of them, indicating the presence of the Spanish army.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of {{what was}} to become the famous Ho Chi Minh Trail {{extended}} over decades, with elements put in place during the anti-French struggle of the Viet Minh. [...] Known to the North Vietnamese as the Truong Son Strategic Supply Route, the Central Committee of the Lao Dong Party ordered construction of routes for infiltration as early as 1959, under the 559 Transport Group. The Trail was a complex web of roads, tracks, bypasses, waterways, depots, and marshaling areas, some [...] in total. [...] It <b>snaked</b> <b>through</b> parts of North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. [...] US policymakers made ground attack against Trail networks in these countries off limits, (until limited operations were permitted late in the War) and communist forces took full advantage of this to move massive quantities of men and material into South Vietnam to attack US and ARVN troops. As the war progressed, communist forces expanded and improved the Trail, moving material by truck, installing missile batteries for air defense and laying fuel pipelines. [...] Air interdiction of the Trail hurt communist efforts but failed to stop the logistical buildup on a sustained basis.|$|R
