5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E
5|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, {{a pair of}} nunchaku with mounted blades, were selected before {{other elements of the}} character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, they were designed to be unique amongst the other <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his nunchaku.|$|E

Li Long was initially considered for inclusion for Soulcalibur, however the developers instead decided to focus on creating a new character using the same weapon for the title, resulting in Maxi. Later, due to the character's popularity, Li Long was selected {{to be included in}} home and arcade versions of Soulcalibur III. In an interview, Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated many fans had requested for the character to reappear in the series, though added no plans had been made to release the character as downloadable content for the title.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the interregnum, Ludlow Castle {{continued}} to be run by Parliamentarian governors, the first being the military commander Samuel More. There was a Royalist plot to retake the castle in 1648, but no other military activity took place. The most valuable items in the castle were removed shortly after the siege, and the remainder of the luxurious furnishings were sold off in the town in 1650. The castle was initially kept garrisoned, but in 1653, most of the <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle were removed on the grounds of security and sent to Hereford, then in 1655 the garrison was disbanded altogether. In 1659, the political instability in the Commonwealth government led to the castle being regarrisoned by 100 men under the command of William Botterell.|$|E
