According to the concept and relative concept of ecological <b>water</b> <b>requirement,</b> generalized and narrow concepts of ecological <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> were defined. Generalized concept of ecological <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> is the total water amount that ecosystem require to keep the balance of water resource under the certain ecological targets; while narrow concept of ecological <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> is the runoff that ecosystem consume to maintain the ecological and environmental function of ecosystem.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> {{pattern for}} tobacco (Yun 85) was {{identified}} based on {{analysis of data}} obtained from pot experiments in a canopy at the Xiuwen Irrigation Test Central Station in Guizhou Province, China. The {{results showed that the}} tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> intensity throughout the growth period in pot experiments were significantly lower than those in field production. In pot experiments, the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> throughout the growth period ranged from 159. 00 to 278. 90  mm, with a reduction in the range of 241 – 441  mm, as compared with that in field production. Also, the average <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> intensity at the vigorous growing stage was 1. 97  mm/d, and the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> module were 33. 80 – 72. 60  mm and 16. 39 %– 33. 09 %, respectively, at the group stage, almost equal to their values at the vigorous growing stage. The patterns of the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> module in pot experiments were different from those in field production. In pot experiments, the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> module ranked the highest at the mature stage, followed by those at the group/vigorous growing and rejuvenation stages, while the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> intensity ranked the highest at the vigorous growing stage, followed by those at the mature, group, and rejuvenation stages. The pattern of the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> intensity in pot experiments was consistent with that in field production. In addition, the response of the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> to <b>water</b> deficit was also analyzed. Serious water deficit at the vigorous growing stage and continuous water stress at the group, vigorous growing, and mature stages can greatly influence the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement.</b> <b>Water</b> deficit led to reductions in the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> intensity at each growth stage. The vigorous growing stage exhibited the highest sensitivity to water deficit. The lower limit of moderate soil water stress at the vigorous growing stage was 65 % of the field capacity.

They are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover.

The net <b>water</b> <b>requirement,</b> which is the net quantity of water demanded in paddy plot, is clarified using the tank model. The tank model consisted of 6 sub tank i. e., irrigation canal tank, paddy tank, upland tank, settlement tank, greenhouse tank and drainage canal tank.

The {{results indicate that the}} <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and shrinkage characteristic of the blended cement mortar are dependent on fly ash fineness and replacement level. The use of coarse fly ash slightly reduces the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> but greatly reduced the drying and the autogenous shrinkage of the blended cement mortars and the reduction is more with an increase in the fly ash replacement level. The finer fly ashes further reduce the <b>water</b> <b>requirement,</b> but increase the drying and the autogenous shrinkages as compared with coarser fly ash. The incorporation of superplasticizer drastically reduces the <b>water</b> <b>requirement,</b> but the effect on the drying and autogenous shrinkages of the normal Portland cement mortar is small.

Other elements such as fluoride, while beneficial in low concentrations, can cause dental problems and other issues when present at high levels.|$|E
