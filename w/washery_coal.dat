Ltd. in Talcher and Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. in Jharsuguda, and at the Kargali <b>Washery,</b> <b>Coal</b> India Ltd. located in Bokaro, Jharkhand. The coals procured for evaluation at the Aryan Energy site were from two different seams, Balaram and Hingula, of the Mahanadi Coalfields. These coals have a relatively high feed ash and are generally difficult to wash due to high proportions of near-gravity material (NGM). Similarly, the coals received for assessment at the Bhushan Power & Steel complex were mixed of Mahanadi and IB-Valley coalfields. The facility process coals from multiple sources. At the Kargali Washery, the ROM coal received for evaluation was from three different coal seams of the Karanpura coalfields. These coals are also contains high ash with {{a high percentage of}} NGMs. For the coal samples evaluated, average feed ash contents were reported 48.7  %, 54.9  %, and 54.6  % on a dry-basis (db) for the Aryan, Bhushan, and Kargali facility, respectively. Typical surface moisture is ranged as low as 3  %– 7  % and as high as 13  %– 17  % during rainy season.|$|E
40|$|Indian coals are {{believed}} to be of drift origin and so it is necessary to wash in washery. A huge quantity of water is required in coal washing. A plant with a capacity of 100 tons of coal/h would require in the course of 8 h shift from 600, 000 to 2, 000, 000 gallons of water. This feed water in the working process comes out from the coal preparation plant in the form of effluents, containing the dirty minerals and impurities associated with the raw coal. For this water quality analysis was conducted out in three <b>washeries</b> -Balanda <b>coal</b> <b>washery,</b> Talcher, Ib valley <b>coal</b> <b>washery,</b> Jharsuguda and Himgir <b>coal</b> <b>washery,</b> Sundergarh.

40|$|Abstract—There {{are many}} sources trough which the soil get enriched and {{contaminated}} with REEs. The determination of REEs in environmental samples {{has been limited}} {{because of the lack}} of sensitive analytical techniques. Soil samples were collected from four sites including open cast coal mine, natural <b>coal</b> burning, <b>coal</b> <b>washery</b> and control in the coal field located in Dhanbad, India. Total concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) were determined using the inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry in order to assess enrichment status in the coal field. Results showed that the mean concentrations of La, Pr, Eu, Tb, Ho, and Tm in open cast mine and natural coal burning sites were elevated compared to the reference concentrations, while Ce, Nd, Sm, and Gd were elevated in <b>coal</b> <b>washery</b> site. When compared to reference soil, heavy REEs (HREEs) were enriched in open cast mines and natural coal burning affected soils, however, the HREEs were depleted in the <b>coal</b> <b>washery</b> sites. But, the Chondrite-normalization diagram showed significant enrichment for light REEs (LREEs) in all the soils. High concentration of Pr, Eu, Tb, Ho, Tm, and Lu in coal mining and coal burning sites may pose human health risks. Factor analysis showed that distribution and relative abundance of REEs of the <b>coal</b> <b>washery</b> site is comparable with the control.
