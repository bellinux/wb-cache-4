5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
500|$|One hundred thirty-eight {{species of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are known to}} live in the Little Applegate's watershed, while another 134 are suspected. Some [...] of the watershed have been designated as Critical Habitat Units for the northern spotted owl, a critically endangered species. Two other species known {{to live in the}} watershed are included in the IUCN Red List: the endangered Siskiyou Mountains salamander, and the vulnerable <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> Bighorn sheep, gray wolves, grizzly bears, and pronghorns once inhabited the region, but are now considered extirpated.|$|E
2500|$|A {{subspecies}} of the Pacific (<b>western)</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{the southern}} Pacific pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata pallida). A project for headstarting pond turtle hatchlings on the preserve began in 2006 with {{grants from the}} Fish and Wildlife Foundation. As of July 2010, 17 juvenile turtles were released from captivity. This process is known as headstarting, [...] where hatchlings are raised in captivity until they are large enough to avoid predators and then released to the wild.|$|E

2500|$|Only at the {{extremities}} of the Pacific Northwest is the turtle's actual range eroding. [...] Even there, in Washington, {{the painted}} turtle is common: it is designated S5 (demonstrably widespread). [...] However, further south, in Oregon (the north {{third of the}} state is painted turtle range), the painted turtle is designated S2 (imperiled). [...] There, federal, state and Portland city governments are working to better understand and arrest the decline of the painted turtle. [...] North of Washington, in British Columbia, the turtle is also in peril. There coastal populations are designated as endangered and Interior populations are designated as [...] "of special concern". [...] The iconic painted turtle is popular in British Columbia and the province is further motivated to stop the loss of the painted turtle because it has already lost all populations of its other native turtle species, the <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> [...] However, despite conservation efforts, only a few thousand turtles remain in the entire province.|$|E

50|$|Until recently, {{the genus}} Clemmys {{consisted}} of four species (bog turtle, spotted turtle, <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{and the wood}} turtle). Recent genetic analyses have revealed that the spotted turtle is distinct from the other three species. The bog turtle and the wood turtle were moved to the genus Glyptemys, while the <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> has been renamed Actinemys. This makes the spotted turtle the sole member of the genus Clemmys.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their aquatic habitat, terrestrial habitat is also extremely important for <b>Western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles.</b> Since many intermittent ponds can dry up during summer and fall months along the west coast, especially during times of drought, <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> can spend upwards of 200 days out of water. Many turtles overwinter outside of the water, during which time they often create their nest for the year.|$|R
50|$|Before European {{settlers}} came to America, tenajas were {{a valuable}} {{source of water}} for early Native Americans traveling in the desert areas of the Southwest.

5000|$|The <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys marmorata also Actinemys marmorata) is one {{of several}} {{reptiles}} at Boggs Lake and is listed as a species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). [...] Boggs Lake provides habitat for the <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> The preserve has water for feeding and body temperature regulation, as well as a nearby upland environment, which allows laying of eggs in areas not subject to submersion and basking areas (again, for regulation of body temperature).|$|E
5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted <b>turtles</b> (C.guttata) and <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|R
25|$|Amphibians include, but are {{not limited}} to, rough-skinned newts, northwestern salamanders, western red-backed salamander, Coastal tailed frog, Coastal giant salamander, red-legged frog, {{southern}} torrent salamander, and Ensatina.

50|$|<b>Western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> {{occur in}} both {{permanent}} and intermittent waters, including marshes, streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes. They favor habitats {{with large numbers}} of emergent logs or boulders, where they aggregate to bask. They also bask on top of aquatic vegetation or position. Consequently, this species is often overlooked in the wild. However, it is possible to observe resident turtles by moving slowly and hiding behind shrubs and trees.|$|R
50|$|Along the Crystal Springs Trail, just {{southwest}} of Cañada Road and its I-280 overpass, is the Homestead Pond. This 12 acre pond and marsh is host to <b>Western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> (Actinemys marmorata) and is {{adjacent to the}} south fork of Laguna Creek. The pond {{is the site of}} a restoration effort by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission which will include removal of non-native eucalyptus trees and planting of native oaks and grasses.|$|R
50|$|The dorsal {{color is}} usually dark brown or dull olive, {{with or without}} darker reticulations or streaking. The {{plastron}} is yellowish, sometimes with dark blotches in the centers of the scutes. The shell is 11 - 21 cm in length. The dorsal shell (carapace) is low and broad, usually widest behind the middle, and in adults is smooth, lacking a keel or serrations. Adult <b>Western</b> <b>Pond</b> <b>Turtles</b> are sexually dimorphic; that is, males have a light or pale yellow throat.|$|R
5000|$|Rare {{amphibians}} {{that depend}} on San Felipe Creek include the California red-legged frog (Rana aurora draytonii), Foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii) and the <b>Western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Actinemys marmorata [...] ).|$|E

50|$|Even {{well after}} California became a state, Tulare Lake and its {{extensive}} marshes supported an important fishery: In 1888, in one three-month period, 73,500 pounds of fish were shipped through Hanford to San Francisco. It {{was also the}} source of a regional favorite, <b>western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles,</b> which were relished as terrapin soup in San Francisco and elsewhere. The lake and surrounding wetlands were a significant stop {{for hundreds of thousands of}} birds migrating along the Pacific Flyway. Tulare Lake was written about by Mark Twain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> {{originally}} {{ranged from}} northern Baja California, Mexico, {{north to the}} Puget Sound region of Washington. As of 2007, they have become rare or absent in the Puget Sound area. They have a disjunct distribution {{in most of the}} Northwest, and some isolated populations exist in southern Washington. <b>Pond</b> <b>Turtles</b> are now rare in the Willamette Valley north of Eugene, Oregon, but abundance increases south of that city where temperatures are higher. They may be locally common in some streams, rivers and ponds in southern Oregon. A few records are reported east of the Cascade Mountains, but these may have been based on introduced individuals. They range up to 305 m in Washington, and to about 915 m in Oregon. They also occur in Uvas Canyon area, Santa Cruz Mts, California.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} reservoir would drown 18 mi of the San Joaquin River, {{which includes}} scenic canyons, whitewater rapids and historic and cultural sites, {{as well as}} reducing the water flow to sensitive habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Reduction of spring flood flows, via capture by Temperance Flat dam, could reduce rearing habitat for spawning salmonids downstream. Bald eagles, several special-status bat species, ringtails, American badgers, and San Joaquin pocket mice {{are found in the}} Temperance Flat study area. <b>Western</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles,</b> which are a California Species of Special Concern, occur regularly at several sites along the proposed flooded area. Additionally, the California tiger salamander, is federally listed as vulnerable in this area and has designated critical habitat nearby.|$|R
