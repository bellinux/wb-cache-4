They may sometimes pirate prey obtained by other medium-sized raptors. Prey may sometimes be cached and eaten subsequently.The red-necked falcon drinks water where available during the afternoons. This has been observed both in India and in Africa, where it sometimes visits waterholes.|$|E
40|$|The dietary {{composition}} of the <b>White-breasted</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> Halcyon smyrnensis, the Small Bee-eater Merops orientalis and the Black Drongo Dicrurus macrocercus was studied between 2005 and 2006 in Nagapattinam District, Tamil Nadu, India by analyzing regurgitated pellets. The analysis revealed that the <b>White-breasted</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> preys mainly on arthropods (83. 40 %) and less on vertebrates; seven orders of insects were identified, with Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera predominant. The small bee-eater diet is composed of Coleoptera (22. 3 %), Hymenoptera (20. 8 %), Hemiptera (14. 1 %), Orthoptera (12. 6 %), Odonata (10. 7 %), Lepidoptera (10. 4 %) and Diptera (8. 6 %).

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{foraging}} behavior of five insectivorous birds, namely <b>White-breasted</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> Halcyon smyrnensis, Small Bee-eater Merops orientalis, Indian Roller Coracias benghalensis, Common Myna Acridotheres tristis and Black Drongo Dicrurus macrocercus in Nagapattinam District of Tamil Nadu, India. The birds {{used a variety}} of perch types for hunting insect prey; in general the electric power line was a common perch type used by all species except the Common Myna. The perching and foraging height used by birds were classified into 3 meter categories, up to 12 m. Aerial feeding or hawking in Bee-eaters and ground feeding in Common Mynas were major feeding techniques, recorded 68 % and 86 % of the time respectively. The other three species used gleaning as a feeding technique. The highest niche overlap was recorded between Indian Rollers and Black Drongos and between White-breasted Kingfishers and Indian Rollers...|$|E
