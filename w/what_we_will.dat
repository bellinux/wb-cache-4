25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E

He cabled Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it, and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz {{had been sent to}} Turkey on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler, as did SS officer Kurt Becher: [...] "Himmler said to me: 'Take whatever you can from the Jews.

She was appointed as the national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights on 10 August 2010. UNICEF Representative Karin Hulshof said of the appointment: [...] "She is equally passionate about her {{work on behalf of}} children and adolescents. We are proud of the work she has done with us so far on child rights, and, we are thrilled about all <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be doing together so that no child gets left behind." [...] In 2009, she shot a documentary for the organisation Alert India to increase understanding of leprosy. She modelled for designer Manish Malhotra and Shaina NC's charity fashion show to raise funds for the Cancer Patients Aid Association (CPAA) NGO. In 2010 Chopra was one of several celebrities who created promotional messages for Pearls Wave Trust, which campaigns against violence and abuse of women and girls.

500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. That is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> try to develop together." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been a}} little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 December, Commander Peter Spindler {{said that}} the {{investigation}} had been completed and that the report of Operation Yewtree was being prepared for publication early in 2013. He said that a total of 589 alleged victims of abuse had come forward in the inquiry, of whom 450 alleged abuse by Savile. Of the alleged victims, 82% were female and 80% were children or young people. There were 31 allegations of rape by Savile across seven police force areas. Commander Spindler said: [...] "Savile's offending peaked in the 70s and <b>what</b> <b>we...</b> <b>will</b> be showing... is how he used his position in society... to get his sexual gratification." [...] The operation had involved 30 police officers, and its cost so far was estimated at about £2 million.|$|E

[...] The press release also indicated that Sarah Lawrence [...] "plans not to participate in the peer reputational survey or data collection for U.S. News and World Report’s rankings" [...] as, according to Myers, [...] "by submitting data and the peer reputation survey we have tacitly been endorsing these rankings [...] all the information we have provided to U.S. News in the past will be available to the public through other channels.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 8, 2013, Lavabit, a Texas-based secure email service {{provider}} reportedly used by Snowden, abruptly {{announced it was}} shutting down operations after nearly 10 years of business. The owner, Ladar Levison, posted a statement online saying he would rather {{go out of business}} than [...] "become complicit in crimes against the American people." [...] He also said that he was barred by law from disclosing what he had experienced over the preceding 6 weeks, and that he was appealing the case in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Multiple sources speculated that the timing of the statement suggested that Lavabit had been targeted by the US government in its pursuit of information about Snowden. The following day, a similar email service, Silent Circle, preemptively shut down in order to [...] "prevent spying". Snowden said about the Lavabit closure, [...] "Ladar Levison and his team suspended the operations of their 10-year-old business rather than violate the Constitutional rights of their roughly 400,000 users. The President, Congress, and the Courts have forgotten that the costs of bad policy are always borne by ordinary citizens, and it is our job to remind them that there are limits to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> pay."

2500|$|On 11 August 2015, Prime Minister Abbott, in {{response}} to the cross-party bill to legalise same-sex marriage being introduced to the parliament, called a special joint party room meeting of the Liberal and National parties. The six-hour meeting resulted in 66 Coalition MPs voting against a free vote being held on same-sex marriage legislation and 33 voting in favour of a free vote. Abbott was accused by Christopher Pyne of [...] "branch stacking" [...] the party room by calling a joint meeting with the largely socially conservative Nationals, as this reduced the prospects of a free vote being endorsed. Following the meeting, Abbott announced that whilst the Coalition would maintain its position of marriage being defined as a heterosexual union {{for the duration of the}} existing parliamentary term, he stated it was his [...] "strong disposition" [...] to hold a national vote on same-sex marriage sometime after the 2016 federal election, either in the form of a plebiscite or constitutional referendum. Labor Party Opposition Leader Bill Shorten argued the proposal was a delaying tactic and would waste money, whilst recommitting to introduce a bill to legalise same-sex marriage within 100 days of taking office if successful at the 2016 federal election. On 17 August 2015, in defiance of Mr. Abbott, Liberal backbencher Warren Entsch introduced the aforementioned private members' bill, saying, [...] "a divided nation is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be if we continue to allow discrimination in relation to marriage on the basis of a person's sexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent to {{an order}} from the Lahore High Court on May 19, 2010, the {{government}} of Pakistan, through its agency the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), indefinitely banned Facebook in the country, {{in response to the}} impending May 20 date at the focus of the protest movement. The order to carry out the shut down of Facebook in Pakistan was given by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which also publicized an email address and phone number and requested individuals contact the agency to let them know about [...] "all similar URLs where such objectionable material is found". Representative Khoram Ali Mehran of the Pakistan agency stated to CNN, [...] "Obviously it (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked. We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it then that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> do." [...] The agency was responding to an action by a group of Islamic attorneys based in Pakistan, who had acted to get the court order due to a Facebook group [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammad Day—May 20". Azhar Siddique had filed the petition to the Lahore High Court on behalf of the organization, the Islamic Lawyers Forum. The government faced pressure from public protests against Facebook. In its petition to the government, the Islamic Lawyers Forum described the [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] event as [...] "blasphemous". Siddique told The Times, [...] "The court has also ordered the foreign ministry to investigate why such a competition is being held." [...] The lawyers succeeded in getting the government to block the Facebook group itself individually on May 18, but the Islamic lawyers requested a full block of the entirety of the Facebook site, because the organization had permitted the posting of the particular group on its site. They argued that unless the entire Facebook website were blocked, {{it would be difficult to}} stop the protest movement campaign on the site. The Lahore court carried out this request, and ordered the government to issue a temporary block on Facebook to stand until May 31, 2010. Justice Ejaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court issued the ruling of the court. The court's ruling determined that the content of the protest movement on Facebook would damage the religious beliefs of the 45million users of the website in Pakistan. The force of the ban was effective immediately after the ruling of the court. Those present for the court's ruling included many religious clerics, attorneys, and students. The court held an in-depth hearing on the matter on May 31, 2010.|$|E
