5|$|In the 1895 gubernatorial election, Kentucky elected its first-ever Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Bradley {{was able}} to {{capitalize}} both on divisions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> {{over the issue of}} Free Silver and on the presence of a strong third-party candidate, Populist Thomas S. Pettit, to secure victory in the general election by just under 9,000 votes. This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true, two-party competition in Kentucky politics.|$|E
5|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to {{not participate}} in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by 9.1million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> grew {{to the extent that he}} was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{was elected}} to succeed Bradley in the {{contentious}} 1899 gubernatorial election. When Democratic nominee William Goebel and his running mate J. C. W. Beckham challenged the election results, Bradley formed part of the legal team for the Republicans. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which found {{in favor of the}} Democrats. Despite {{being a member of the}} state's minority party, Bradley {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, divisions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to Prohibition made him more palatable to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected Bradley. Bradley had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. On the day he announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a streetcar accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.|$|E

25|$|In the South, Klan {{members were}} still Democratic, {{as it was}} {{essentially}} a one-party region for whites.

McAuliffe and his staff raised $275 million, then an unprecedented sum, for Clinton's causes while president. After Bill Clinton's tenure ended, McAuliffe guaranteed the Clintons' $1.35 million mortgage for their home in Chappaqua, New York. The deal raised ethical questions. In 2000, McAuliffe chaired a fundraiser with the Clintons, setting a fundraising record of $26.3million.|$|E
25|$|The debate {{continued}} through the summer between the two as to which approach {{would be best for}} the Democratic Party. The Hamburg Massacre in July, although limited in fatalities compared to the total from later incidents at Ellenton, Charleston and Cainhoy, persuaded many whites that Governor Chamberlain's administration was unable to maintain order. In most of these events, blacks were killed in much greater number than whites, particularly at Ellenton. Populist Democrats ended hopes of supporting fusion with the Republicans, and the Straighouts became the dominant force <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is {{responsible}} for promoting Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC {{is responsible}} for overseeing {{the process of writing}} the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy. In presidential elections, it supervises the Democratic National Convention. The national convention is, subject to the charter of the party, the ultimate authority <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times.

25|$|With white Democrats having regained {{power in}} the state legislature, they passed a poll tax in 1877, which disenfranchised many poor blacks and whites, {{preventing}} them from registering. In 1908, the state established a white primary; with the only competitive contests <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> it was another way to exclude blacks from politics. They constituted 46.7% of the state's population in 1900, but the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American dropped thereafter to 28% primarily due to leaving the state during the Great Migration. This disfranchisement persisted through the mid-1960s, until federal legislation with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|E
25|$|The {{keynote address}} at the 2004 Democratic National Convention (DNC) was given by then Illinois State Senator, United States senatorial candidate, and future President Barack Obama {{on the night of}} Tuesday, July 27, 2004. His {{unexpected}} landslide victory in the March 2004 Illinois U.S. Senate Democratic primary made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party overnight, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. His keynote address was well received, which further elevated his status <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and led to his reissued memoir becoming a bestseller.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Colter {{founded the}} Arizona Highline Reclamation Association, {{the goal of}} which {{was to create a}} system of dams and {{reservoirs}} in the state, utilizing the waters of the Colorado. The concept also had the support of Colter's long-time political ally, Hunt, who had been re-elected as governor in 1922, defeating the man who had defeated Colter in the 1918 governorship race, Campbell. Early in 1924, Colter announced that he would be challenging incumbent Carl Hayden for his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Hayden was a proponent of the Sante Fe Compact, and this was seen as an internal struggle <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> in Arizona. However, for reasons unknown, Colter later withdraw from the race, although Hayden did tone down his support for the agreement.|$|E

500|$|Staffers {{who worked}} on McGovern's 1972 {{campaign}} later became influential <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> Campaign manager Gary Hart staged his own presidential runs in 1984 and 1988. Future president Bill Clinton, with assistance from his future wife and politician Hillary Rodham, had managed the McGovern campaign's operations in Texas. Hart both embraced and moved away from aspects of his past affiliation with McGovern, while Clinton, and the Democratic Leadership Council movement {{of which he was}} a part, explicitly rejected McGovern's ideology. But there was still a legacy in terms of staffing, as the Clinton White House would be full of former [...] "McGovernites".|$|E
500|$|Nunn then faced Democrat Henry Ward in {{the general}} election. During the campaign, Nunn charged that Democrats wanted to raise {{taxes to pay for}} {{administrative}} inefficiencies.

Nunn allied himself closely with the national Republican campaign against Lyndon B. Johnson, bringing several prominent Republicans to the state to speak for him. He won the election by a vote of 454,123 to 425,674, despite the fact that half of the other state offices went to Democrats, including the lieutenant governorship, won by Wendell Ford.|$|E
