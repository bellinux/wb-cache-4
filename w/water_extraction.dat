5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower.

40|$|In {{past decades}} {{there has been}} a sharp decline in per capita water {{availability}} in many countries 1, and this is expected to get worse with growing populations and economic growth 2, 3. If per capita water availability continues to fall, it will exacer-bate underlying tensions between extractive and in-stream uses of fresh water and, with business as usual, will result in further environmental decline 4. Research so far has focused either on the microscale, with studies of particular rivers, or on the macro- or global scale, with studies of anthropogenic stresses on river systems 5, 6, climate change impacts 7 – 9 or climate adaptation 10, 11. Despite this rich liter-ature, a mesoscale analysis remains unexplored, especially cross-continental, basin-scale comparisons.

40|$|Water {{is one of}} {{the vital}} {{components}} of the Earth environment which needs to be frequently monitored. Satellite multispectral remote sensing image has been used over decades for <b>water</b> body <b>extraction.</b> Methodology of <b>water</b> body <b>extraction</b> can be summarized to three groups: feature extraction, supervised and unsupervised classification and data fusion. These methods, however, are of pure mathematical and statistical approach and little of them explore essential characteristics of multispectral image which is based on ground object radiance absorption behaviour in each sensing spectral bands. The spectral absorption characteristics of water body in visible and infrared bands differ very much from the other ground objects. They depend only on the used spectral bands and can be considered as invariant and sensor independent. In this paper the author proposed an application of spectral pattern analysis for <b>water</b> body <b>extraction</b> using spectral bands green, red, near infrared NIR and short wave infrared SWIR.

40|$|This study {{correlated}} extractabilities of 37 d aged phenanthrene residues in four dissimilar soils {{with the}} fraction that {{was available for}} earthworm (Lumbricus rubellus) accumulation and microorganism (Pseudomonas sp.) mineralisation. Extractability was determined using two established techniques, namely, (1) a <b>water</b> based <b>extraction</b> using CO 2 equilibrated water and (2) an aqueous based hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (HPCD) extraction. Results showed no relationship between earthworm accumulation and phenanthrene extractability using either HPCD (r 2 = 0. 07; slope=- 4. 76; n= 5) or the <b>water</b> based <b>extraction</b> (r 2 = 0. 31; slope=- 5. 34; n= 5). Earthworm accumulation was overestimated by both techniques. In contrast, the fraction of phenanthrene extractable using both the HPCD technique and the <b>water</b> based <b>extraction</b> correlated strongly with microbial mineralisation.

30|$|In conclusion, {{the main}} {{difference}} between the HCl and <b>water</b> <b>extractions</b> was the amount of simultaneous removal of glucose and lignin.
