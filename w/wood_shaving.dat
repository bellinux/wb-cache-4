40|$|Mastitis causes largest {{economic}} losses in dairy production. Sub-clinical mastitis is detected in 50 % of lactating cows in Lithuania. Curing effect is transient if major causes and factors of mastitis are not eliminated. Prophylactic measures are directed {{to strengthen the}} immune system of the cow and to define and to eliminate all factors causing mastitis. Bacteria are present on skin of the teat in the surroundings. Use of antiseptics of cow teats before and after milking {{is the most effective}} preventive procedure that can prevent from new mastitis cases. Antiseptic solutions help to fight most opportunistic and contagious bacterial infections causing mastitis. Teat antiseptics can reduce mastitis incidence by 50 to 75 %. It is recommended to use antiseptic solutions for udder and teats, as they improve physical condition of the udder and milk quality. Agents for udder and teat antiseptics contain bactericidal, skin protecting components in aqueous solution. Bactericidal activity is defined to kill germs during chemical and biological reactions. Active ingredients are iodoforms, chlorhexidins, sodium hypochloride, sodium chloride, lactic acid, hypochloric acid, antimicrobial proteins and fatty acids. Teat dipping reduces bacterial milk contamination, and spreading of pathogens on the teats during the milking. For the present moment this procedure is also used in Europe. Spraying teats with two different concentrations of iodine solution before and after the milking effectively reduces skin contamination with staphylococcal and colliform bacteria. Action of pre-dip and post-dip is similar. The aim of our investigation was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} antiseptic materials used before and after milking on bulk milk bacterial contamination, somatic cell count and incidences of sub-clinical mastitis. We selected in farm No. 1, cows with 500 000 103 /ml somatic cell count. In this farm antiseptic teat dipping was routinely used after milking. In this farm we also used disincentive <b>wood</b> <b>shave</b> for udder cleansing. Udders were cleansed before each milking using 5 to 10 g. disincentive <b>wood</b> <b>shave</b> soaked in water. No significant changes were observed after the use of this udder cleansing method. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 57. 33 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 49. 11 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 43. 67 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0. 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 507. 89 ± 47. 40 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 199. 33 ± 41. 69 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically In farm No. 2, no antiseptic substances were used before the experiment. Before each milking, udders were routinely cleaned with damp towels. At the start of the experiment, udders were cleansed with disincentive <b>wood</b> <b>shave</b> and teats were dipped following the milking. At the start of the experiment, the results were worse – total bacterial count increased, as well as somatic cell count. Microbial contamination of udder was higher at the start of the experiment, compared to the end. At the start of use of antiseptic substances, bacterial udder contamination significantly decreased, and this resulted in decreased milk bacterial contamination and milk somatic cell count. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 46. 33 ± 8. 23 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 40. 21 ± 7. 33 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 35. 24 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0, 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 340. 0 ± 36. 93 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 122. 17 ± 12. 08 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically <b>Wood</b> <b>shave</b> was used for udder cleaning in the farm. Many farms use this cleaning method for the present time. It is very effective to remove rests of bedding and manure from the teats. It is enough 5 to 10 g. of <b>wood</b> <b>shave</b> to clean udder ant teats. The shave can also be soaked with antiseptic solution. One more advantage is that teat cleansing with <b>wood</b> <b>shave</b> more intensively stimulates milk let-down. We, however, did not observe an increase in milk production during our experiment, but this cleansing method had positive effect reducing bacterial contamination of udder. Analysis data shows that antiseptic materials must be used before and after the milking, because teat canal is open 30 min. after the milking...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{have over}} time domesticated the horse from {{a wild animal}} into a domesticated. At first humans used horses to feed on, many years later they started to use horses as {{transportation}} and fighting gear. They also started housing the horses. Straw {{is one of the}} most common and cheapest bedding materials on the market. In earlier studies straw have shown a poor absorbency and high ammonia emission. The manufactures state that <b>wood</b> <b>shaving</b> pellets have a good absorption capacity and a low ammonia emission, there are few studies that supports this statement. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate <b>wood</b> <b>shaving</b> pellets, chopped straw and wood shavings on a daily base. The secondary aim was to calculate the economic factors on the different bedding materials. The study tested three bedding materials; <b>wood</b> <b>shaving</b> pellets, chopped straw and wood shavings. There were three groups of five to six horses in each group during five weeks of study. The experiment was located a stable at the Swedish National Equestrian Centre Strömsholm. The boxes were cleaned twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon by the students in equine studies program. The working times of cleaning the boxes, manure discharge and adding fresh bedding materials were noted. Ammonia concentration was measured in each box at one time at the end of the study. A test was made to measure how many times each bedding material could absorb its own weight of water. The data were processed statistically and the significance level was set at p< 0. 05. An analysis of variance was done to find significant differences between treatments (bedding material) and where appropriate significant differences were followed with post-hoc test (Holm-Sidak). This study showed that <b>wood</b> <b>shaving</b> pellets was not profitable compared to chopped straw and wood shavings. The uppermost reason was the high purchase price, the material would be more profitable if the price was lower seeing that the material had the lowest working time, manure discharge and the lowest ammonia emission and should therefore be considered as a bedding material. Chopped straw was the bedding material that became most profitable due to the low purchase price, even though it had the highest working time and manure discharge. The studies first hypothesis “wood shaving pellets has a lower working time than wood shavings and chopped straw” was accepted. The other hypothesis “wood shavings is the most profitable bedding material” was rejected...|$|E

However, the addition of sewage sludge to soils have not always shown positive effects, {{probably due to the}} particular characteristics of the residues concerned: high heavy metal or phytotoxic substance content, excess of labile organic matter, pathogenic microorganisms, etc. Composting process can be a useful tool to eliminate some of these problems. In the present work, a sewage sludge mixed with <b>wood</b> <b>shaving</b> as bulking agent has been composted. During this process, a decrease of organic matter fractions due to organic matter mineralization was observed. Fresh sewage sludge contained high numbers of pathogen microorganisms but when this material was submitted to composting process microorganisms decreased to suitable level. Organic compounds such as pesticide residues can also be partially or totally degraded by microorganisms during composting process, prometrine and terbutrine being the most recalcitrant compounds. Composting process eliminated phytotoxic compounds contained in sewage sludge, permitting an adequate germination index. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} air quality by measuring gas concentrations, and assess the surface and inside temperatures of deep litter materials in a finishing swine building. The experiment was conducted during the months of June and July. It was compared three treatments: deep litter composed of <b>shaving</b> <b>woods</b> + sugarcane bagasse (M + B), deep litter composed of sugarcane bagasse (BAG) and deep litter consisting of <b>shaving</b> <b>woods</b> (MAR). The installation stalls had a concrete floor under the deep litter. Measurements of instantaneous concentrations of ammonia, NH 3 (ppm), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ppm) and carbon monoxide (CO, ppm) {{at the level of the}} animals were taken. Data relating to surface temperature and inside the deep litter for swine were collected at three different points within the stalls (center, in the frontal region and background of the stalls). It was observed that the "MAR" deep litter showed the highest average concentration of NH 3 (2. 88 ppm). The "BAG" deep litter showed the lowest values of NH 3 for all time intervals evaluated. In the morning period was observed significant differences for all treatments. The highest CO 2 concentration (1530 ppm) was observed in treatment "BAG" at 11 h 30 min. The surface temperatures of deep beddings showed no significant differences between the sampling points. The temperature inside the deep litter at the front of the stall treatment was higher (M + B) when compared to treatment (ABG) and (MAR). The concentration of CO, CO 2 and NH 3, measured, gases not reached levels that could cause harm to the health of animals...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess two deep-bedding swine with {{different}} substrates, shavings woods and sugarcane bagasse through analyses of 6 lots with 40 animals to determine their agronomic potential as a fertilizer. Each pen housed the animals in the finishing phase for 90 days. Samples were collected at the time of removal of both beds, after 1 year of use. The results showed that the bed sugarcane bagasse presented a higher concentration of minerals due to their higher decomposition, while the bed with <b>shaving</b> <b>woods</b> had a higher concentration of carbon, causing an increase in the ratio of carbon/nitrogen, promoted by a lower mineralization of the organic matter due to the presence of large-scale lignificant material in the timber. The average concentration of nutrients found in the beds, makes it as a possible source of organic fertilizer for use on crops. </p...|$|R
40|$|The best {{electrolyte}} balance value (EB) for broilers {{performance from}} 1 to 7, 1 to 14, 1 to 21 and 1 to 42 days of age was evaluated. Eight {{hundred and sixty}} four male Ross chikens ageing one day old, were reared on floor covered with <b>shaving</b> <b>woods</b> and fed diets based in corn-soybean combined with - 50; 0; 50; 100; 150 and 200 mEq/kg of EB. The experiment was analized as randomized block design with six replicates of 24 chicks each experimental unit. Weigh gain, feed intake, feed efficiency (FE) were evaluated at 7, 14, 21 and 42 days of age. The best values of EB estimated were 173, 192 and 200 mEq/kg, respetivly for 14, 21 and 42 days of age. It was also observed that high levels of chlorine magnify the humidity of the litter {{by means of the}} increasing of the excretion of water.

Objetivou-se determinar os melhores valores de balanço eletrolítico (BE) para o desempenho de pintos de corte de um a 7; um a 14; um a 21 e um a 42 dias de idade. Utilizaram-se 864 pintinhos machos, Cobb, criados em galpão de alvenaria, cobertos com maravalha e alimentados com ração composta, principalmente milho e farelo de soja, combinadas com cinco níveis de balanço eletrolítico (- 50; 0; 50; 100; 150 e 200 mEq/kg). Foi utilizado delineamento em blocos ao acaso, com seis repetições e 24 aves por unidade experimental. Avaliou-se o ganho de peso, o consumo de ração e a conversão alimentar aos 7, 14, 21 e 42 dias de idade e a matéria seca da cama ao fim do experimento.
