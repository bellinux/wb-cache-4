25|$|The station {{signed on}} the air on September 26, 1954 as WINT, {{originally}} broadcasting its signal from a transmitter in Auburn. It was Fort Wayne's second television station to launch but was technically licensed to, and had studios in, Waterloo. The station's original owner, Tri-State Television (not {{to be confused with}} Tri-State Christian Television, owners of WINM channel 12), took advantage of peculiarities in Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules to direct the signal to Fort Wayne. Although the city <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to support three full network affiliates, the FCC had originally allocated only a single station, WKJG-TV (now WISE-TV) on UHF channel 33, to the city. This circumstance attracted the attention of Congress and led to changes in how broadcast licenses were assigned.|$|E

25|$|By 1592, the Scottish {{community}} in Rome <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to merit {{the building of}} Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi (English: St Andrew of the Scots). It was constructed for the Scottish expatriate {{community in}} Rome, especially for those intended for priesthood. The adjoining hospice was a shelter for Catholic Scots who fled their country because of religious persecution. In 1615, Pope Paul V gave the hospice and the nearby Scottish Seminar to the Jesuits. It was rebuilt in 1645. The church and facilities became more important when James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, set up residence in Rome in 1717, but were abandoned during the French occupation of Rome in the late 18th century. In 1820, although religious activity was resumed, {{it was no longer}} led by the Jesuits. Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi was reconstructed in 1869 by Luigi Poletti. The church was deconsecrated in 1962 and incorporated into a bank (Cassa di Risparmio delle Province Lombarde). The Scottish Seminar also moved away. The Feast of St Andrew is still celebrated there on 30 November.|$|E
25|$|Fort de la Malmaison {{lay on the}} Chemin-des-Dames {{ridge and}} had been built {{as part of an}} entrenched camp north of the Aisne, in the Séré de Rivières system, {{designed}} by General Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières and built from the 1870s. The fort was in the northern angle between the Chemin-des-Dames and the Soissons–Laon road. The fortress casemates were tested with high explosives in 1887 and found to be insufficiently robust. Steel reinforced concrete had been added but in 1913, the fort was sold to a Laon contractor, to demolish and use the materials to build new barracks in town. A long tunnel, the Montparnasse Quarry lay on the northern slopes below the fort, on the route to Chavignon village {{at the foot of the}} ridge. The quarry <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to shelter an infantry brigade. The fort was to the north-west of the quarry, on the summit of the plateau at the western end of the ridge and the dismantled work was surrounded by a moat filled with mud. The subterranean galleries had been rebuilt and garrisoned by the Germans in September 1914, the outworks and interior being provided with several ferro-concrete machine-gun nests. From the ramparts, the Germans could see all movement from the Ailette to the Aisne and on the spurs running down to the Aisne from the Chemin-des-Dames ridge.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in Egypt, Seleucus sent {{his friends to}} Greece to inform Cassander and Lysimachus, the ruler of Thracia, about Antigonus. Antigonus was now {{the most powerful of}} the Diadochi, and the others would soon ally against him. The allies sent a proposition to Antigonus in which they demanded that Seleucus be allowed to return to Babylon. Antigonus refused and went to Syria, where he planned to attack Ptolemy in the spring of 314 BC. Seleucus was an admiral under Ptolemy. At the same time he started the siege of Tyros, Antigonus allied with Rhodes. The island had a strategic location and its navy was capable of preventing the allies from combining their forces. Because of the threat of Rhodes, Ptolemy gave Seleucus a hundred ships and sent him to the Aegean Sea. The fleet was too small to defeat Rhodes, but it <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to force Asander, the satrap of Caria, to ally with Ptolemy. To demonstrate his power, Seleucus also invaded the city of Erythrai. Ptolemy, nephew of Antigonus, attacked Asander. Seleucus returned to Cyprus, where Ptolemy I had sent his brother Menelaos along with 10,000 mercenaries and 100 ships. Seleucus and Menelaos began to besiege Kition. Antigonus sent most of his fleet to the Aegean Sea and his army to Asia Minor. Ptolemy now had an opportunity to invade Syria, where he defeated Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, in the battle of Gaza in 312 BC. It is probable that Seleucus took part in the battle. Peithon, son of Agenor, whom Antigonus had nominated as the new satrap of Babylon, fell in the battle. The death of Peithon gave Seleucus an opportunity to return to Babylon.|$|E

500|$|Agincourt mounted {{fourteen}} BL 12-inch Mk XIII 45-calibre guns {{in seven}} twin hydraulically powered turrets, unofficially {{named after the}} days of the week, starting from Sunday, forward to aft. This was the largest number of turrets and heavy guns ever mounted on a dreadnought battleship. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 13.5°. They fired [...] projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at 13.5°, this provided a maximum range of just over [...] with armour-piercing (AP) shells. During the war the turrets were modified to increase their maximum elevation to 16°, but this only extended the range to [...] The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5 rounds per minute.

500|$|As no studio <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> for the {{interior}} of Stromberg's supertanker, and set designer Ken Adam {{did not want to}} repeat what he had done with SPECTRE's volcano base in You Only Live Twice— [...] "a workable but ultimately wasteful set"— construction began in March 1976 of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the 007 Stage, at a cost of $1.8 million. To complement this stage, Eon also paid for building a water tank capable of storing approximately 1,200,000 gallons (5,500,000 litres). The soundstage was so huge that cinematographer Claude Renoir found himself unable to effectively light it due to his deteriorating eyesight, and so Stanley Kubrick visited the production, in secret, to advise on how to light the stage. For the exterior, while Shell was willing to lend an abandoned tanker to the production, the elevated insurance and safety risks caused it to be replaced with miniatures built by Derek Meddings' team and shot in the Bahamas. Stromberg's shark tank was also filmed in the Bahamas, using a live shark in a saltwater swimming pool. Adam decided to do experiments with curved shapes for the scenery, as he felt all his previous setpieces were [...] "too linear". This was demonstrated with the Atlantis, which is a dome and curved surfaces outside, and many curved objects in Stromberg's office inside. For Gogol's offices, Adam wanted an open space to contrast M's enclosed headquarters, and drew inspiration from Sergei Eisenstein to do a [...] "Russian crypt-like" [...] set.|$|E

2500|$|In 1889, Alaskan needed {{underwater}} {{work and}} maintenance on her hull. [...] However {{there were no}} drydocks in the Pacific Northwest. [...] Instead there were only wooden “gridirons”, enormous frames of wood weighted down with rocks placed on a beach or mudflat. [...] When work was needed below the waterline of a vessel, the procedure was simply to float the ship over the gridiron, wait for the tide to run out, {{and work on the}} vessel as fast as possible before the tide came back in.

2500|$|However, {{concerns}} {{began to}} grow about the stability of Zumwalts hull.

On the , with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern {{comes out of the}} water - and basically roll over." [...] There were also doubts whether the Zumwalt hull <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to accommodate ballistic defense weapons, and a possible nuclear propulsion system. In July 2007 came the first suggestions that the AOA might recommend a two-class solution, a 14,000ton [...] "escort cruiser" [...] based on the Zumwalts stealthy [...] "tumblehome" [...] hull, and a ballistic missile defense ship of 23,000tons. The latter would use a more conventional shape than the tumblehome, as its use of radars to search for missiles while on station would make a stealthy hull pointless. In July 2008, Roscoe Bartlett of the House Seapower subcommittee stated that it was [...] "unlikely the [...] hull could be used in the CG(X) program".|$|E
