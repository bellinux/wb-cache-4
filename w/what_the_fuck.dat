5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, <b>What</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1991, {{the slogan}} [...] "It's Grim Up North" [...] {{appeared}} as graffiti on {{the junction of}} London's M25 orbital motorway with the M1, which runs to Northern England. The graffiti, for which the JAMs denied responsibility, led to a House of Commons motion being timetabled by Member of Parliament Joe Ashton regarding regional imbalance. In September 1997, {{on the day after}} Drummond and Cauty's brief remergence as 2K, the graffiti [...] "1997: <b>What</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fuck's</b> Going On?" [...] appeared on the outside wall of London's National Theatre, ten years after the slogan [...] "1987: <b>What</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fuck's</b> Going On?"

500|$|In 1991, Drummond admitted: [...] "We didn't {{listen to}} 1987 <b>What</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fuck's</b> Going On {{for a long}} time, and when we did we were embarrassed by {{it because it was}} so badly recorded. But I still felt {{we were able to get}} a lot out of {{ourselves}} through it." ...|$|R
500|$|Referring to {{the fate}} of the 1987 LPs, Drummond sings [...] "Build a fire, stoke it good, throw them on, and watch the bastards burn", {{accompanied}} by a stark, ring modulated chorus, [...] "Mu Mu!". [...] A later portion of the lyrics alludes to New Year's Eve 1987: [...] "Five to twelve, almost gone. [...] 1987, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> have we done?".|$|E
500|$|Double Nickels on the Dime {{contained}} several inside {{jokes that}} were missed by the band's audience. Watt later remarked: [...] "No one knew <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> {{we were talking}} about. We'd explain it to people and they'd say, 'I don't get it, what's so funny about that?' And we couldn't tell them because it was our whole angle on the rock & roll, our worldview on the music scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{track is}} opened by Gimpo {{screaming}} [...] "It's 1997: <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> is going on?". There follows a brass band version of [...] "What Time Is Love? (Pure Trance Original)", with a house rhythm added, along with samples from The JAMs' 1987 recordings [...] "All You Need Is Love", [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)", [...] "Whitney Joins The JAMs" [...] and [...] "Burn the Bastards". Drummond leads {{a crowd of}} Liverpool Dockers in angry chants: [...] "Fuck the millennium! We want it now!".|$|E

500|$|... 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?) is {{the debut}} studio album by British {{electronic}} band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), later {{to be known}} as The KLF. 1987 was produced using extensive unauthorised samples which plagiarised a wide range of musical works, continuing a theme begun in the JAMs' debut single [...] "All You Need Is Love". These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for beatbox rhythms and cryptic, political raps. The album was released to mixed reviews, but was a commercial success.|$|E
500|$|Mark Lindsay of the US band Paul Revere & the Raiders {{recalled}} {{buying the}} single and first {{listening to it}} {{at home with his}} producer at the time, Terry Melcher. According to Lindsay: [...] "When the song ended we both just looked at each other. I said, Now <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> are we gonna do?' With that single, the Beatles raised the ante as to what a pop record should be." [...] Lindsay ensured that the clips for both sides of the single were broadcast on the Raiders' television show, Where the Action Is.|$|E
500|$|Ritualistic burnings {{had already}} been a {{recurring}} aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut albumThe Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?)by burning them in a Swedish field. This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and celebrated in the song [...] "Burn the Bastards". During the 1991 summer solstice, they burnt a [...] wicker man. This was chronicled in The KLF movie [...] The Rites of Mu.|$|E
500|$|Drummond and Cauty's {{works were}} both highly self-referential and rife with {{references}} to The Illuminatus! Trilogy esoteric novel, from which The JAMs took their name. [...] Their last work, as 2K and K2 Plant Hire, continued many of these themes. [...] Their subversive attitude was exhibited {{in their attempt to}} undermine the pop comeback. [...] They defaced a wall of the National Theatre the day after the Barbican performance: the graffiti [...] "1997: <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck's</b> going on?" [...] referenced their similar graffiti of ten years earlier on the same wall of the arts establishment. [...] The unusual show at the Barbican was typical of their previous confusing and humorous costumed appearances; moreover, the horns strapped to their foreheads were previously used in The KLF's cowl costumes. [...] The advertising campaigns before and after the single's release resumed Drummond and Cauty's characteristic promotional tactic of cryptic, monochrome full-page adverts placed in UK national newspapers and music press.|$|R

500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At {{the beginning and end of}} the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, [...] "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: [...] "Do whatever you want, just wait till college because you don't know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck's</b> up right now." [...] Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode [...] "The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000".|$|R
500|$|The JAMs re-edited {{the single}} {{in such a}} way that—they hoped—"brought [...] inside the [...] "law" [...] but still got up peoples noses", {{removing}} all but a snatch of The Beatles, replacing or doctoring the MC5 sample, and rerecording the Samantha Fox vocal. [...] This new version—named [...] "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)"—was released on 18 May 1987 as JAMS 23T, and was included on The JAMs debut album 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?).

500|$|In a July 1987 {{review of}} 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?), Q {{magazine}} recalled {{that the original}} release of [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] "seemed an inspired moment of pure wildness. Here were Red Clydeside beatbox rappers pointing a finger at society, putting their record together from samples pirated directly from other people's recordings, {{while at the same}} time crossing almost all contemporary music tribal boundaries by including everyone from Samantha Fox to The MC5 among their victims." [...] This was contrasted with 1987 which the reviewer felt was a [...] "disappointment" [...] with [...] "too few ideas being spread too thin".|$|E
500|$|While on [...] "The Asylum In-store Tour", Bruce and Utsler were {{informed}} by Abbiss {{that they were}} offered $100,000 to perform at Woodstock '99. They were excited about the offer, as it indicated {{their impact on the}} music industry. Some people perceived participating in Woodstock '99 was a sell-out for the group; however, Bruce and Utsler disagreed. As Bruce explains, [...] " [...] sold out the mainstream style for us! Woodstock never came to us and asked us to change one fuckin' thing about us or our show! They wanted ICP just as ICP is, and nothing else. If that ain't fresh, then I don't know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> is!".|$|E

[...] The performance began with a screening of This Brick, a short 35mm film of a brick made {{from the ashes of}} the K Foundation's million-pound bonfire. Following an introduction by Factory Records founder Tony Wilson, Drummond and Cauty were then unveiled as pyjama-clad, wheelchair-using pensioners with grey hair and, strapped to their foreheads, prominent horns that had been used regularly in The KLF's promotional videos. [...] Drummond was also seen plucking feathers from a dead swan. [...] According to a press release issued by Mute/Blast First (Acid Brass' and 2K's record label), [...] "Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of Dettol, caused havoc in their motorised wheelchairs. These old reprobates, bearing a grandfatherly resemblance to messrs Cauty and Drummond, claimed to have just been asked along." [...] The duo wheeled around the stage to the sound of Acid Brass' [...] "What Time Is Love?". [...] They were supported variously by a male choir's rendition of [...] "K Cera Cera", joined by opera singer Sally Bradshaw; the Viking Society in costume as lifeboatmen; and the politically topical Liverpool Dockers chanting [...] "Fuck the Millennium". [...] Following the performance, every audience member received a [...] "Fuck the Millennium" [...] T-shirt, poster, and bumper sticker in a carrier bag.|$|R

He lit it so everyone could see how it smelled like, and then it disappeared. And he was like, 'Where is it now? Who has it now? Can you please pass it back to the front.' But it was like, gone.

500|$|King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime was {{recorded}} in Bearsville Studios, in Woodstock, New York. Gould has described the remote location of the studio {{as a form of}} [...] "sensory deprivation". Writing and rehearsing the songs for the album took eight to nine months, although half of this time was also spent finding a replacement for Martin. Recording the album took an additional three months, for which the band hired producer Andy Wallace. Wallace—unconnected to their previous producer Matt Wallace—had previously worked with Sonic Youth, Nirvana and Slayer. Bottum claimed the combination of Wallace and Spruance as two new influences helped to create [...] "a real up-in-the-air, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> is gonna happen kind of feel" [...] while recording.|$|E
500|$|Unknown to Bakshi, Krantz and {{producer}} Al Guest {{were in the}} middle of a lawsuit. Failing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. He narrowly avoided capture before being stopped by an American border guard who asked him what he was doing. Bakshi responded, [...] "All of these guys are heading into Canada to dodge the draft and I'm running back into the States. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> is wrong with that!?" [...] The guard laughed, and let Bakshi through. Vita was detained at the airport; he was searched and interrogated for six hours.|$|E
500|$|Moore wrote lyrics for {{the album}} by [...] "mumbling {{along to the}} song and then {{deciphering}} what I'm saying." [...] The lyrics feature political themes ("Hello, Helicopter!" [...] is about the US supplying military arsenals to other countries to protect its own national interests), although Matheos stated that the album was not political in nature. Moore said that he writes lyrics based on personal experiences, and {{that much of the}} album's lyrical content stems from how the September 11 attacks affected him. Moore's brother was a firefighter who worked at the World Trade Center after the attacks, [...] "and I was totally apolitical before this, politically naïve and I still am," [...] Moore stated. [...] "I was like, 'Whoa, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> {{is going on in the}} world?'" ...|$|E

50|$|At {{one point}} Jim {{said to me}} during the {{recording}} session, and he was tearful, and he shouted in the studio, 'Does anybody understand me?'

So what Jim says {{at the end of the}} Oedipus section, which is essentially the same thing that the classic says, kill the alien concepts, get back reality, the end of alien concepts, the beginning of personal concepts.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{describes}} {{a relationship that}} Robert del Naja had, {{which at the time}} had just ended:I already had a lot of the lyrics written before. It was just about a relationship I had been going through. It's about being in a situation but knowing you should be out of it but you're too fucking lazy or weak to leave. And you're dishonest to yourself and dishonest to the other person. You're betraying them [...] and the whole scene feels like it's closing in on you, d'ya-know-what-I-mean? The idea is a combination of movements propelling yourself forward and pulling yourself back at the same time. That's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> track's about—a <b>fucked</b> up relationship basically and there it is.|$|R
500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen.

[...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier.

500|$|... "Burn the Bastards" [...] is a 1988 song by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), {{from their}} second, and final before {{changing}} names, album Who Killed The JAMs?. [...] The [...] "bastards" [...] {{of the title}} are copies of The JAMs first album, 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?), which Drummond and Cauty burnt on a bonfire in a Swedish field after a copyright dispute with the Swedish pop group ABBA. The song (which is based upon Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "Dance to the Music") was released as a single, along with a separate single of remixes titled [...] "Burn the Beat". [...] Both singles were credited to The KLF, marking a change of name and with it a change of musical genre, from The JAMs' sample-fuelled political hip-hop to The KLF's upbeat and uptempo house music.|$|E
500|$|R.E.M. started {{recording}} Reckoning at Reflection Sound in Charlotte, North Carolina, on December 8, 1983. The group recorded {{over two}} eight-day stretches around Christmas 1983, separated by {{two weeks of}} canceled studio time that allowed the band to play a show in Greensboro, North Carolina, go out to see a movie, and shoot a video in the studio. While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews Buck at times commented that the album was recorded in 11 days. The producers both disputed that the sessions were that short; Dixon insisted that {{they were at the}} studio for at least 25 days (during which he worked eighteen-hour days), while Easter said [...] "When I read 'eleven days' I thought, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck!</b> It was twenty days, which was still short, but it's not eleven." ...|$|E
2500|$|A boycott by musicians {{saying they}} would not stage {{performances}} in Arizona was co-founded by Marco Amador, a Chicano activist and independent media advocate and Zack de la Rocha, the lead singer of Rage Against the Machine {{and the son of}} Beto de la Rocha of Chicano art group Los Four, who said, [...] "Some of us grew up dealing with racial profiling, but this law (SB 1070) takes it to a whole new low." [...] Called the Sound Strike, artists signing on with the effort included Kanye West, Cypress Hill, Massive Attack, Conor Oberst, Sonic Youth, Joe Satriani, Rise Against, Tenacious D, The Coup, Gogol Bordello, and Los Tigres del Norte. [...] Some other Spanish-language artists did not join this effort but avoided playing in Arizona on their tours anyway; these included Pitbull, Wisin & Yandel, and Conjunto Primavera. [...] The Sound Strike boycott failed to gain support from many area- or stadium-level acts, and no country music acts signed on. [...] Elton John very publicly opposed such efforts, saying at a concert performance in Tucson: [...] "We are all very pleased to be playing in Arizona. I have read that some of the artists won't come here. They are fuckwits! Let's face it: I still play in California, and as a gay man I have no legal rights whatsoever. So <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> up with these people?" [...] By November 2010, Pitbull had announced a change of heart, playing a show in Phoenix because large parts of the law had been stopped by the judicial action. My Chemical Romance, an original Sound Strike participant, supposedly dropped out and scheduled a show in the state as well [...] (however, the following day the show was cancelled and the band apologized, explaining that it was an error with tour scheduling and it should not have been booked in the first place due to [...] "the band's affiliation with The Sound Strike" [...] ). De la Rocha said Sound Strike would continue despite the injunction against large parts of SB1070 in order to battle Arizona's [...] "racist and fear mongering state government" [...] and until the Obama administration stopped participating in federal actions such as the 287(g) program, Secure Communities, and other U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies.|$|R
