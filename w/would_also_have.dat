5|$|Explosives <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been superfluous. At its closing {{velocity}} of 10.2km/s, the impactor's kinetic energy was equivalent to 4.8 {{metric tons of}} TNT, considerably more than its actual mass of only 370kg.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6 was {{primarily}} {{supported by the}} manned Soyuz spacecraft, which carried out crew rotations and <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> {{been used in the}} event of an emergency evacuation. The ferries docked automatically to the station, making use of the new Igla automatic docking system, and were used by departing crews to return to Earth at the end of their flight.|$|E

5|$|Some Athenian citizen {{women were}} merchants, and Athenian law forbade {{criticism}} of anyone (male or female) for selling in the marketplace. Women <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> {{gone to the}} market to purchase goods; although wealthy women owned slaves they could send on errands, poorer women went to the market themselves.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Blyton and Darrell Waters {{married at}} the City of Westminster Register Office on 20 October 1943. She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters and {{publicly}} embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor's wife. After discovering she was pregnant {{in the spring of}} 1945, Blyton miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The baby would have been Darrell Waters's first child and it <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been the son for which both of them longed.|$|E
50|$|After leaving FMW, Goto {{has since}} been wrestling {{throughout}} the Japanese indies, including one-night returns to AJPW in 2001 and 2002. He <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> two matches for Extreme Championship Wrestling in July 1996, defeating Axl Rotten both nights. In 1995, he formed Super FMW, which lasted from 1995-1998 in its first run and from 2009-2012 in its second run.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{possibilities}} was a 15 acre {{site in the}} Carillon area. The Carillon location <b>also</b> <b>had</b> twice as many people within a 30-minute drive than either downtown St. Petersburg site, according to an internal report released by the Rays. Carillon Town Center would have provided potential for shared parking with adjacent development and excellent connectivity to the I-275 interstate corridor. This site <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had potential for a rapid transit connection.|$|R
50|$|According to XCOR, the Lynx was {{intended}} to fly four or more times a day, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the capacity to deliver payloads into space. The Lynx Mark I prototype was expected to perform its first test flight in 2015, followed by a flight of the Mark II production model twelve to eighteen months afterwards.|$|R
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been accused of recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is one of}} Aereon's {{lifting body}} airship concepts, where a craft without a {{conventional}} [...] "wing" [...] generates lift by itself. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been filled with rising gas such as hydrogen, making it a truly hybrid craft. This kind of configuration was researched by Aereon during the 1980s. However, a patent was filed in 1969.|$|R

[...] (The auxiliary <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> other uses, such as expressing conditional mood.) However, {{in many cases the}} habitual nature of the action {{does not need to be}} explicitly marked on the verb, and the simple past is used: [...] "We always ate dinner at six o'clock." ...|$|R
50|$|This had {{the effect}} that the low cost non-European TV {{manufacturers}} would not only have to pay royalties to the EU manufacturers but <b>would</b> <b>also</b> not <b>have</b> direct access to the technology and hence would always be behind with new developments.|$|R
5|$|In 1776, the Sejm {{commissioned}} former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski {{to draft}} a new legal code. By 1780, he and his collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (Zbiór praw sądowych). It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless szlachta of many of their legal immunities. The Code <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> improved the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the {{criterion}} for the award was changed {{in an effort to}} further stimulate the Dutch film industry. Films released after January 1, 2003 had to reach paying audiences of 100,000 to qualify for the Golden Film and 400,000 for the Platinum Film. All films that had received a Golden Film before 2003 <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> received a Golden Film under the new criterion. From 2003 until 2007, the percentage of cinema visitors in the Netherlands who watched a Dutch film was between 9.20% and 13.4%.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to take {{a significant number of}} properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E
50|$|Two seating {{expansions}} {{have been}} considered since the park opened. One plan would have added 600-1,000 seats on the third base side. The expansion would match how the first base side is angled towards the infield. The other proposal was to add a smaller version of the Green Monster with seating for approximately 200 people. This <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> shortened the field and raised the wall to 20 ft. Due to lack of funds, neither have been built.|$|R

5|$|In {{his book}} Geniocracy, Raël {{outlined}} {{his plan for}} a peaceful worldwide political union that, while democratic, would require members of the electorate to meet a minimum standard of intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Raëlians are 50% above average for a candidate and 10% above average for a voter. The world government <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a global currency, a common language, and a transformation of militaries of the world into civil police.|$|E
5|$|Married {{women were}} {{responsible}} for the day-to-day running of the household. At marriage, they assumed responsibility for the prosperity of their husband's household and the health of its members. Their primary responsibilities were bearing, raising and caring for children, weaving cloth and making clothes. They <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been responsible for caring for ill household members, supervising slaves, and ensuring that the household had sufficient food.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2008, Aliferi {{returned}} {{yet again}} to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction {{to begin with a}} condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to return for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due to the location, which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.|$|E
50|$|FCS-W was {{designed}} to deliver a top road speed of 75 mph and a top cross-country speed of 40 mph. The vehicle's armor utilized armor similar to the tracked variant but was lighter. The vehicle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> some type of active protection system. The arrangement of the turbine and drive motor provided for a two-man, side-by-side cockpit and a sizable payload compartment.|$|R
50|$|One way {{to remove}} the noise is to filter the signal with a notch filter at the mains {{frequency}} and its vicinity, which could excessively degrade {{the quality of the}} ECG since the heart beat <b>would</b> <b>also</b> likely <b>have</b> frequency components in the rejected range.|$|R
5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} {{his health care}} plan. It called for expanded coverage {{for children and adults}} but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said it could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|R
5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and weight would have {{rendered}} the tank unable to cross bridges {{at the risk of}} collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended speed was 40kilometres per hour, its huge size and high visibility would have made it extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> made it nearly impossible to transport—no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E
25|$|A. d. binghami, the Indonesian giant honey bee, is {{classified}} as the Indonesian subspecies of the giant honey bee or a distinct species; in the latter case, A. d. breviligula and/or other lineages <b>would</b> probably <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to be considered species.|$|R
25|$|The IND Fulton Street Line was {{supposed}} to be extended farther east into Queens as part of the IND Second System, via an extension of the Fulton Elevated or a new subway. The line would have gone as far as Springfield Boulevard in Queens Village or 229th Street in Cambria Heights, both near the Nassau County border. The line <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a spur to the Rockaways.|$|R
