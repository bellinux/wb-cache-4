50|$|The Russian {{military}} was considering replacing the BMD series altogether with the GAZ-3937. This very lightweight wheeled armoured personnel carrier that incorporates plastic and carbon fibre in its construction, {{as well as}} aluminum. The GAZ-3937 can be air-dropped like the BMD, but is considerably lighter and less expensive to manufacture. Since the GAZ-3937 lacks the armor protection, cross-country mobility, and heavy armament of the BMD series, and is armed only with a 7.62 mm PKM machine gun {{in front of the}} commander's hatch, the BMD-4 (an upgraded BMD-3) has been selected for the future use of the Russian airborne and naval infantry. The BMD-4 uses the same 100 mm main gun with 30 mm autocannon and 7.62 mm medium machine gun turret on an improved, larger hull raising overall weight to the 15-ton class.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{catamaran}} ships have been very rapidly evolved into a dominant mode of sea transportation. Their particular area of proliferation is the short sea shipping where they show considerable superiority over competitive designs in attributes such as power requirements, economy, space availability and seakeeping. The rapid growth of the market {{has led to the}} need for an expanded range of catamaran designs in terms of size, speed, and payload diversity (passengers, vehicles, containers). However, even now, there is a scarcity of publicly available preliminary design tools for catamarans. This fact hinders the ship owner and naval architect from being able to quickly assess the relative merits of alternative potential designs without having to resort to expensive expert consultancy solutions. Resistance characteristics and power requirements are principal aspects of the catamaran design spiral as they are strongly coupled with speed and fuel economy, and, consequently, the operating and cost efficiencies of the vessel. This thesis aims towards the development of a tool that predicts the resistance and required power for catamaran vessels in the range of 20 m to 80 m. Vessels with both round bilge and hard chine hulls are considered. (cont.) Reasonable accurate prediction may be achieved for all speed regions of intended operation. (Displacement, semi-displacement and planning) The user will be able to select both propellers and <b>waterjets</b> for the <b>propulsion</b> of the vessel. For any given vessel size and operational profile the user will be able to determine the most efficient design by altering a series of inputs related to ship geometry and propulsor characteristics. Besides preliminary powering predictions, the tool has the potential to assist in parametric trade-off studies by exploring sets of hull form - propulsor combinations due to its ability to produce variants within a very short time frame. by Fragiskos Zouridakis.

5000|$|The FUG {{is similar}} to the Soviet BRDM-1 {{armoured}} scout car, though several differences reflect an independence of the design. It has two <b>waterjets</b> for amphibious <b>propulsion</b> instead of one as in BDRM-1. Due to the similarities with BRDM-1, the D-442 FUG is sometimes mistaken for a BRDM-1 modification.It is primarily intended for reconnaissance activities, particularly behind the enemy lines. It was converted to be used in a variety of different roles such as an artillery observation post, a mobile command/observation post and NBC reconnaissance. The Hungarian FÚG version can be fitted with a pintle-mounted RPD LMG, but on the OT-65 the main weapon was a 7.62 UK light machine gun (vz. 59) with electromagnetic release.D-442 has much more angular shape than the BRDM-1's boat-like hull. The vehicle shares similarities with both BRDM-1 and BRDM-2. Like the BRDM-1, the standard version has no permanent armament. As in BRDM-1 and BRDM-2, the commander and the driver were sited {{in the front of the}} hull, driver on the left and commander on the right. Also as with both the BRDM-1 and the BRDM-2, the D-442 FUG has four infra-red driving lights in the front. The other similarities with the BRDM-1 include the windshields which in combat situation are replaced by armoured shutters with integral vision blocks and two firing ports on both sides of the troop compartment. However to use the armoured shutters the windshields have to be removed. When the shutters are in their opened position they protect driver and commander from being blinded by the sunlight and ensure that the windscreens won't be blurred by rain or snow. Driver and commander can use episcopes to view the battlefield instead of the windshields. The vehicle however has a hanged layout, unlike the BRDM-1 which had a conventional 4x4 layout. The layout is identical to that of BRDM-2, the engine compartment is in the rear and crew compartment is in the front and center. The transmission is located in the middle. Thanks to this the engine is much better protected from enemy fire. The D-442 FUG has a roof with two hatches over commander's and driver's stations.While the BRDM-1 and BRDM-2 only had hatches on top of the roof, the D-442 FUG has a round escape hatch in the floor.The vehicle is powered by a Hungarian-made Csepel six-cylinder diesel engine. The exhaust is located on the right hand side of the hull. The vehicle is equipped with a winch, intended, among others, for self-recovery when stuck in difficult terrain. To improve cross-country capability, central tire-pressure regulation system can also be used to decrease the pressure in all tires before crossing an obstacle and to increase it to the required level after the obstacle has been crossed. The tire pressure can be reduced and controlled by the driver from his post by the means of valves and a pressure indicator. Like the BDRM-1 and BRDM-2, it has four auxiliary belly wheels which the driver can hydraulically lower to assist the vehicle in crossing obstacles and gaps. Speed is sacrificed in this mode of travel, which is accomplished in first gear at a speed of five to eight kilometers per hour.Water obstacles can be crossed by swimming. In water, the vehicle is driven by two water jets controlled by the driver which are steered by reversing the thrust. Stability of the vehicle in water is improved by a trim board which is erected at the front before entering the water. While in its traveling position it serves as additional armour.The armour on the vehicle which is composed of welded steel, protects it fully against small arms fire and small shell fragments but doesn't protect it against big artillery fragments and a [...]50-calibre machine gun fire which can penetrate D-442 FUG maximum armour of 13 millimeters and D-944 PSzH maximum armour of 14 millimeters. The D-442 FUG-series and D-944 PSZH tires are not protected by armour. They are particularly vulnerable to puncture from fire of all kinds.D-442 FUG armoured scout car has its weak spots however. One of the biggest flaws of the D-442 FUG armoured scout car is the lack of permanent armament. To operate the pintle-mounted 7.62 mm light machine gun in the front the soldier had to expose himself to enemy fire. This issue was taken care of in D-944 PSZH developed in late 1960s, which had a small two part side door on both sides of the hull and a turret armed with 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun and 7.62 mm coaxial general purpose machine gun. Both weapons can be elevated between -5 and +30 degrees. The turret has two IR spotlights, one next to the armament and the second one on top of the turret. It also has a radio antenna on back of the turret. Like in the BRDM-2 there two hatches over driver's and commander's stations in the front of the turret. Contrary to the popular belief the turret used in D-944 PSZH is different from the BPU-1 turret used in BRDM-2. The vehicle also introduced NBC protection system and infrared night-vision equipment.Even though the D-944 PSZH resembles the BRDM-2, it does not have the flaw related to entering and exiting the vehicle (See BRDM-2 for details) which is present in D-442 FÚG, because the vehicle has side hatches as opposed to the front roof hatches. Because the vehicle uses an only slightly modified hull of D-442 FÚG it also has the round escape hatch in the floor.|$|R

From this, the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly. Through further developments, it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types, and as such, waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels, including passenger ferries, rescue craft, patrol boats and offshore supply vessels.|$|E
