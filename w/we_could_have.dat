25|$|Conor Counihan {{claimed his}} team lost because of missed {{opportunities}} to score"'We were definitely at a stage out there {{where we had}} opportunities and had we taken them, well {{it might have been}} an entirely different story. There's no doubt <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> put more pressure on Kerry at a couple of crucial periods. We didn't take our chances, however, and that's what it all boils down to".|$|E

25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E
500|$|However, in 2008, Marky Ramone stated: [...] "There were no guns {{pointed at}} anybody. They [...] were there {{but he had}} a license to carry. He never held us hostage. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> left at any time." ...|$|E
50|$|Note that in {{this example}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> chosen the vector 0001 as the coset leader of the final row, even though it meets the critedia of having minimal weight (1), because the vector was already present in the array. <b>We</b> <b>could,</b> however, <b>have</b> chosen it as the first coset leader and {{constructed}} a different standard array.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not wery often, sir, but {{occasionally}} we does. You see, we're so nigh the Goodwin sands, where wrecks {{take place in}} the winter months pritty constant, that poor fellers are sometimes washed past us; but they ain't always dead. One night we heard loud cries not far off from us, but it was blowin' a gale, and the night was so dark <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see nothin'. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> no more <b>have</b> launched our boat than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>'ave</b> gone over the falls o' Niagary without capsizin'. When next the relief comed off, we heard that it was three poor fellers gone past on a piece of wreck." ...|$|R
500|$|The song's meaning {{originated}} {{with a discussion}} between Brandon Heath and friend and songwriter Jason Ingram. [...] "We had a conversation over Chinese food that we wished <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> God’s perspective on things", Heath said. [...] "If we did have His perspective, we'd wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> it {{for long periods of}} time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning." [...] He soon began to pen a song about the idea, co-writing [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] with Ingram. Prior to recording What If We, Heath had written 40 possible tracks for the album, and although the song was not his top favorite, he noted that [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was [...] "one of the first that really stuck out." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker {{was also}} {{involved}} in the Paris bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. His reaction to London's successful bid was: [...] "I don't know what else <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done. If we don't have it now, I guess we will never get it. The IOC {{seems to be very}} pro-Anglo-Saxon. I feel extremely gutted." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon wanted [...] "Revolution" [...] {{to be the}} A-side of the single, but {{the other}} Beatles did not agree. In his 1970 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, he said [...] "Hey Jude" [...] was worthy of an A-side, [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> had both." [...] In 1980, he told Playboy he still disagreed with the decision.|$|E
50|$|Note that, in the definition, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>have</b> {{disposed}} {{of the condition}} that the space is Hausdorff.|$|R
6000|$|And {{still the}} King hung back and was afraid. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> had him there to back {{us with his}} authority! Bedford had lost heart and decided to waive {{resistance}} and go an concentrate his strength in the best and loyalest province remaining to him--Normandy. Ah, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> persuaded the King to come and countenance us with his presence and approval at this supreme moment! ...|$|R

500|$|Piquet retired on lap13, after {{spinning}} off and {{colliding with}} a wall. Following the race, the Renault driver blamed damp patches {{on the track}} for the incident, adding that [...] "It's a shame because I'm sure <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done something today." [...] On lap17, Rubens Barrichello retired with a gearbox problem, suffering from a failing sixth gear and engine over-revving.|$|E
500|$|Members of the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, which {{included}} leaders from mainline Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish organizations from the city, {{issued a statement}} that expressed [...] "moral dismay" [...] over the painting. They further added that the display of the painting showed [...] "a lack of sensitivity which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> expected from those who were responsible for its showing".|$|E

500|$|Film is {{absolutely}} right for this project. It has scale, big exterior locations and that's something that still challenges HD.... The HD cameras available to us on our budget are still vulnerable in difficult weather conditions [...] There's no doubt that what we've got on 35mm is just so much more detailed. It has so much more depth of field and richness than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got on HD.|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> held the remand prison, meaning <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Conran disputed {{this budget}} {{figure in a}} 2015 interview. “I take great issue with that [...] {{personally}} and I’d like someone to show me where all that money went,” says Kevin. “I don’t support those numbers and I never have. We walked into Jon Avnet’s office that first day and he said, ‘What {{do you want for}} the production?’ and we said $3million. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done a version of this film for $3million. It would have been black-and-white and sans name actors...|$|E

500|$|For {{the rest}} of the event, Tucker commented that Wyatt [...] "lost nothing by losing, but Cena {{certainly}} lost a lot by winning. The man shows no weakness". Tucker also noted that the segment involving Hogan, Austin and the Rock was [...] "meaningless, surreal and a lot of fun". Tucker concluded by saying that the event was [...] "easily one of the best Manias of the last ten years" [...] and that [...] "the future certainly does look bright. If only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> said our good-byes properly".|$|E
500|$|The thirteenth stage (13 July) of the 1967 Tour de France {{measured}} {{it started}} in Marseille, crossing Mont Ventoux (the [...] "Giant of Provence") before finishing in Carpentras. At dawn Tour doctor, Pierre Dumas, met journalist, Pierre Chany, near his hotel. Dumas noted the warm temperature, [...] "If the boys stick their nose in a 'topette' [...] today, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a death on our hands". At the start line, a journalist noticed Simpson looked tired and ask him if the heat was the problem. Simpson replied, [...] "No, it's not the heat, it's the Tour." ...|$|E
500|$|When the [...] "Plankton!" [...] {{episode was}} pitched to Nickelodeon, Hillenburg {{had already decided}} that he wanted Lawrence to play Plankton. However, network {{executives}} wanted a guest star to provide his voice since he was set to appear in only one episode. Lawrence mentioned {{in an interview with}} fellow SpongeBob actor Thomas F. Wilson that the studio said, in his words, [...] "'we could stunt-cast this. You know, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve [...] was just like, 'it's Doug, don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'" ...|$|E
