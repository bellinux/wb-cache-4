25|$|There {{has been}} some debate amongst arachnologists {{as to whether the}} <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> (A. a. aquatica) belongs to the family Cybinidae or Argyronetidae. In this article the Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> (A. a. japonica) is listed as being in the family Argyronetidae, because the {{subspecies}} authority, Hirotsugu Ono, chose to place it in this family.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> {{is unusual}} in that males are almost always larger than females. This is called sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD). When water spiders mate the male begins by approaching the female’s diving bell. He then chases {{her out of the}} diving bell and they begin “courtship swimming.” They then return to the female’s diving bell to mate.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> spins {{four main}} kinds of silk: (1) silk {{used for the}} diving bell, (2) silk to anchor the diving bell to water plants, (3) silk for “walking” so as to get prey and mate, and (4) silk for the egg-cocoon. The diving bell silk is “used for breathing,” that is it serves to {{oxygenate}} the diving bell. Females produce larger diving bells than males. Males build their diving bells less carefully than females do. Males also frequently make more walking threads than females.|$|E

25|$|Reversing the {{traditional}} roles, species that have males consuming females are relatively unknown; {{the few that}} do show a male-biased sexual dimorphism. Examples include Allocosa brasiliensis, Evarcha culicivora, and Argyronetia aquatica. Male <b>water</b> <b>spiders,</b> Argyronetia aquatica, show a predilection for mating with larger females, while cannibalizing females smaller than themselves.|$|R
25|$|The mizugumo {{was a set}} {{of wooden}} shoes {{supposedly}} allowing the ninja to walk on water. They were meant to work by distributing the wearer's weight over the shoes' wide bottom surface. The word mizugumo {{is derived from the}} native name for the Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> (Argyroneta aquatica japonica). The mizugumo was featured on the show MythBusters, where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ukidari, a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed {{in the form of a}} round bucket, but was probably quite unstable. Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater for longer periods of time.|$|E
500|$|Females of the <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> Argyroneta aquatica build {{underwater}} [...] "diving bell" [...] webs {{that they}} fill with air and use for digesting prey, molting, mating and raising offspring. They live almost entirely within the bells, darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the threads that anchor it. A few spiders use {{the surfaces of}} lakes and ponds as [...] "webs", detecting trapped insects by the vibrations that these cause while struggling.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> (Argyroneta aquatica japonica) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>water</b> <b>spider.</b> In Japanese it {{is called}} the mizugumo. The Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> is almost exactly like its European cousin. The only distinction between the two is that the Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> has larger genitalia. Like its cousin, the Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> lives under water by constructing diving bells, underwater spheres which contain oxygen, which they live in.|$|E
5000|$|Pisaurina mira is {{a species}} of spider in the family Pisauridae, the members of which are {{commonly}} called [...] "nursery web spiders." [...] They are similar to wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and to the long-legged <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> (Trechaleidae). The best way to distinguish the Pisauridae from other Families is by observing their eye patterns.|$|R
5000|$|In a gorge on Granite Plateau Creek {{there is}} a high granite cliff known to bushwalkers as Aqualung Wall [...] At the base of the cliff there are {{permanent}} waterholes containing <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> (Dolomedes spp.). The name of the cliff refers to the spider’s habit of submerging below the surface to hunt, or avoid predation, while breathing from bubbles of air attached to hairs on its abdomen.|$|R

50|$|If {{you look}} {{carefully}} {{into the water}} at Weed Lake, {{you might be able}} to spot a diving beetle. You have to look quite carefully though because they are only 4 - 5 mm long. Their diet consists of dead plants and fish and they only live for about a week. They start as eggs, then pupa, larvae and adult. Diving beetles fly from pond to pond. These beetles’ predators include frogs, fish, salamanders, and <b>water</b> <b>spiders.</b> There are over 300,000 species around the world. Sometimes diving beetles ride on the backs of fish. Their bodies and nose are round. They can be black, brown, and green.|$|R
5000|$|Larger spiders {{are able}} to produce larger bubbles which have a {{consequently}} higher oxygen conductance, but all spiders of this species {{are able to}} enlarge their bells in response to increased oxygen demands in low aquatic P(O2) environments. These spiders voluntarily tolerate internal conditions of low oxygen, enlarging their bells with air when the P(O2) drops below 1 kPa; this replenishment process may not need to occur for several days, in some cases. This system {{has been referred to}} as [...] "the <b>water</b> <b>spider's</b> aqua-lung of air bubbles", though an aqua-lung lacks gas exchange with the surroundings; this system is more properly regarded as an inorganic form of gill.|$|R
2500|$|Seismic {{communication}} is {{the exchange of}} information using self-generated vibrational signals transmitted via a substrate such as the soil, <b>water,</b> <b>spider</b> webs, plant stems, or a blade of grass. [...] This form of communication has several advantages, for example it can be sent regardless of light and noise levels, and it usually has a short range and short persistence, which may reduce the danger of detection by predators. [...] The use of seismic {{communication is}} found in many taxa, including frogs, kangaroo rats, mole rats, bees, nematode worms, and others. [...] Tetrapods usually make seismic waves by drumming {{on the ground with}} a body part, a signal that is sensed by the sacculus of the receiver. [...] The sacculus is an organ in the inner ear containing a membranous sac that is used for balance, but can also detect seismic waves in animals that use this form of communication. Vibrations may be combined with other sorts of communication.|$|E

5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and <b>water</b> <b>spiders.</b> Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|R
50|$|The plateau is a {{drainage}} basin for the Granite Plateau Creek, and its major tributary, Saucepan Creek. Both of these creeks flow only briefly after rain {{and as the}} region receives highly variable rainfall, water is scarce {{for most of the}} year and both creeks are ephemeral. In places the creeks have cut deep gorges and valleys into the plateau’s granite creating permanent and semi-permanent waterholes that support numerous species of frogs including the brown toadlet (Pseudophryne bibroniiand), <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> (Dolomedes spp.) and small populations of unidentified fish. The fish are possibly spangled perch, (Leiopotherapon unicolor) a widely distributed desert fish common in much of the Hamilton Creek Catchment, or Lake Eyre Hardyhead, (Craterocephalus eyresii) the most common and widely distributed fish in the Flinders Ranges.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{the term}} Aqualung was popularized by the popular {{television}} series Sea Hunt (1958). This series {{never said that}} an aqualung could be called anything else, or made by anyone else, but the company that supplied Mike Nelson. The Voit Rubber Corporation provided most of the diving equipment used in this series, but actual Aqua-Lungs appeared in early episodes. The word [...] "aqualung" [...] was commonly used in speech and in publications as a term for an open-circuit, demand valve-controlled breathing apparatus (even after Air Liquide's patent expired and other manufacturers started making identical equipment), occasionally also for rebreathers, and in figurative uses (such as [...] "the <b>water</b> <b>spider's</b> aqualung of air bubbles").

40|$|Omniphobic {{surfaces}} {{found in}} nature have great potential for enabling novel and emerging products and technologies to facilitate the daily life of human societies. One example is the water and even oilrepellent cuticle of springtails (Collembola). The wingless arthropods evolved a highly textured, hierarchically arranged surface pattern that affords mechanical robustness and wetting resistance even at elevated hydrostatic pressures. Springtail cuticle-derived surfaces therefore promise to overcome limitations of lotus-inspired surfaces (low durability, insufficient repellence of low surface tension liquids). In this review, {{we report on the}} liquid-repellent natural surfaces of arthropods living in aqueous or temporarily flooded habitats including water-walking insects or <b>water</b> <b>spiders.</b> In particular, we focus on springtails presenting an overview on the cuticular morphology and chemistry and their biological relevance. Based on the obtained liquid repellence of a variety of liquids with remarkable efficiency, the review provides general design criteria for robust omniphobic surfaces. In particular, the resistance against complete wetting and the mechanical stability strongly both depend on the topographical features of the nano- and micropatterned surface. The current understanding of the underlying principles and approaches to their technological implementation are summarized and discussed...|$|R
