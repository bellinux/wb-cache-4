40|$|In Norway {{purse seine}} catches of saithe are usually {{sold to the}} {{factories}} alive. The fish is transported in boats specially constructed for the transport, i. e. well-boats. The saithe is weighed when transferred to these well-boats. The usual method of weighing has been to transfer the saithe by a dip net to a perforated container placed on a balance scales. Last year, however, a few well-boats started using a scales hanging from the derrick hook above the dip net, {{and the weight of}} each load could be read off immediately. In this study the above methods of weighing saithe were compared, taking into account the accuracy of the methods, the mortality rate of the saithe, and time and effort involved in the process. Both systems of weighing were used on board a well-boat in which the well was divided into two separate compartments; and each load <b>weighed</b> was controlled <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> to land. No difference in accuracy could be detected between the two methods of weighing, but the use of derrick scales seems to give a slightly better survival rate and, furthermore, this method saves both time and effort...|$|R
40|$|Decreasing broiler {{density in}} farms is {{foreseen}} by directive 2007 / 43 /EC [2], especially if mortality results {{are higher than}} a fixed threshold. The highest incidence of chicken mortality in industrial production occurs {{during the first week}} of rearing. In order to decrease mortality of broiler chickens during the first days of rearing, this experiment studied the effect of different transport durations on day-old chicks’ mortality. Also, dehydration and zootechnical performances such as feed intake and body weight gain were assessed during the rearing period. Just after hatching, 7800 chicks (ROSS PM 3) from breeders of 35 weeks old were transported to a poultry house in boxes of 100 chicks and distributed into three treatments: the first group was transported in a truck for 4 hours (T 4), the second was transported in the same truck for 10 hours (T 10) and the last group (T 0) was moved directly from the hatchery to the farm (few minutes). During transport air temperature in the truck was 28 °C to 29 °C with a relative humidity of 34 % to 36 %. <b>After</b> <b>transport,</b> chicks were reared in the same house and each treatment was divided into 4 pens of 35 m² with 650 chicks each. Hematocrit rates, used as an indication of dehydration status, were assessed by sampling chick blood before and <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> and at day 3. Chicks were <b>weighed</b> before and <b>after</b> <b>transport,</b> and once per week until slaughter (Day 35). Feed intake was measured weekly until slaughter age. No differences between treatments were observed in hematocrit rates, feed intake, or mortality. However, chicks’ weights just <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> and until day 21, were significantly lower in transported chicks for 4 (T 4) and 10 hours (T 10) than those moved directly to the farm (T 0), but no effect was observed at Day 28 until slaughter age (Day 35). In conclusion transport of chicks for 4 or 10 hours had no effect on mortality, dehydration, and feed intake but reduced chick body weight until 21 days. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Since {{transport}} evokes physiological adjustments {{that include}} endocrine responses, {{the objective of}} this study was to examine the responses of circulating β-endorphin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels to transport stress in stallions. Methods Forty-two healthy Thoroughbred and crossbred stallions were studied before and <b>after</b> road <b>transport</b> over distances of 100, 200 and 300 km. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein: first in a single box immediately before loading (pre-samples), then immediately <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> and unloading on arrival at the breeding stations (post-samples). Results An increase in circulating β-endorphin levels <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> of 100 km (P P P P P > 0. 05) between horses of different ages and different breeds were observed for β-endorphin, ACTH and cortisol levels. Conclusion The results obtained for short term transportation of stallions showed a very strong reaction of the adrenocortical system. The lack of response of β-endorphin <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> of 200 – 300 km and of ACTH <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> of 300 km seems to suggest a soothing effect of negative feedback of ACTH and cortisol levels. </p...|$|R

40|$|Effects of water-misting sprays with forced {{ventilation}} <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> during summer on meat quality, stress parameters, glycolytic potential and microstructures of muscle in broilers were investigated. A total of 105 mixed-sex Arbor Acres broilers {{were divided into}} three treatment groups: i) 45 -min transport without rest (T group), ii) 45 -min transport with 1 -h rest (TR group), iii) 45 -min transport with 15 -min water-misting sprays with {{forced ventilation}} and 45 -min rest (TWFR group). The results showed the TWFR group significantly increased (p< 0. 05) initial muscle pH (pHi) and ultimate pH (pHu) and significantly reduced L* (p< 0. 05), drip loss, cook loss, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase activity, plasma glucose content, lactate and glycolytic potential when compared with other groups. Microstructure of the muscle from TWFR group broilers under light microscopy showed smaller intercellular spaces among muscle fibers and bundles compared with T group. In conclusion this study indicated water-misting sprays with forced ventilation <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> could relieve the stress caused by transport under high temperature, which was favorable for the broilers’ welfare. Furthermore, water-misting sprays with forced ventilation <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> slowed down the postmortem glycolysis rate and inhibited the occurrence of PSE-like meat in broilers. Although rest <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> could also improve the meat quality, the effect was not as significant as water-misting sprays with forced ventilation <b>after</b> <b>transport...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fish {{transportation}} {{is a common}} practice on fish farms and {{is considered to be}} a stressor that could negatively affect fish health. The objective of this study was to evaluate several physiological responses of stress in jundiá caused by transport at different loading densities. Jundiá juveniles were placed in plastic bags on a mechanical transport simulator for four hours at four different loading densities (75, 150, 250 and 350 g L- 1) and then transferred to sixteen 80 -L plastic boxes for 96 hours <b>after</b> <b>transport.</b> Water samples were collected before and <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> to measure dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and ammonia levels. Blood samples were taken at departure and arrival, as well as at 24 and 96 hours <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> to monitor cortisol, glucose, ammonia, chloride and hematocrit levels. Water ammonia levels were found to increase gradually as loading densities increased. Plasma ammonia was higher <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> in fish from all treatments. Compared to initial values, substantial increases in plasma cortisol and ammonia levels were detected mainly in those fish submitted to the highest loading density. Blood glucose appeared to be positively influenced by the increase of transport densities. No statistical differences were observed in any of the other blood parameters. The costs in fish culture, as in other animal production systems, must be minimized and fish producers depend on optimal techniques to ensure better profit. Therefore, based on fish survival and the physiological indicators determined in the present study, especially during recovery, the best density at which to transport jundiá in plastic bags for four hours is about 350 g/L...|$|R
40|$|Twelve Bos indicus bulls were {{allocated}} {{to one of}} two treatment groups: rumen transfaunation (n = 6) given 10 kg of rumen fluid <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> or Control (n = 6), given 10 kg of deionised water <b>after</b> <b>transport.</b> Glycogen concentrations of the M. semimembranosus, M. semitendinosis and M. longisimus dorsi were measured before transport on Day – 7 and <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> on Day 0, Day 1, Day 4 and Day 9. Feed intake, liveweight gain, plasma metabolites and electrolytes were recorded on the sampling days. Rumen transfaunation increased the dry matter intake of treated bulls compared with the bulls treated with deionised water. Rumen transfaunation had no effect on glycogen concentrations of the M. semimembranosus, M. semitendinosis and M. longisimus dorsi compared with the bulls treated with deionised water. The M. semimembranosus and the M. semitendinosis decreased in glycogen concentration immediately <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> on Day 0 but repleted to pre-transportation concentrations within 1 day.

This study evaluated the effect of typical production practices during transport of cattle on the resulting incidence of pathogenic bacteria in cattle and their resulting carcasses. Various factors, including type of animal, body condition score, breed, age, time of feed/water withdrawal, contamination level of transport vehicle at the feedlot/farm, transport time/distance, contamination level of the holding pen, and time held in holding pen, were evaluated for their effect on the incidence of Salmonella and Campylobacter in feedlot cattle and adult beef cattle. Four groups of feedlot cattle and four groups of adult cattle were sampled on different days. Samples were collected from the cattle both prior to <b>transport</b> and <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> (rectal and hide swabs) {{as well as from the}} carcasses derived from these cattle. Furthermore, environmental samples were collected from the transport vehicles, holding pens, and knock boxes at the slaughter facility. Following sample collection, microbiological examination was conducted to provide a characterization of the incidence of Salmonella and Campylobacter within the segment of the farm-to-table continuum in Texas related to the transport of cattle from feedlots/farms to the slaughter plants. The intestinal carriage rate of Salmonella for feedlot cattle decreased from 5. 0 % prior to transport to 3. 0 % <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> whereas the intestinal carriage rate for adult cattle increased from 1. 0 % prior to transport to 20. 8 % <b>after</b> <b>transport.</b> Although the adult cattle were shedding more Salmonella overall, hide contamination with Salmonella was very similar for both feedlot and adult cattle (an increase from approximately 19. 0 % prior to transport to 55. 0 % <b>after</b> <b>transport).</b> Carcass contamination with Salmonella was 19. 0 % for feedlot cattle and 54. 2 % for adult cattle. The intestinal carriage rate of Campylobacter for feedlot cattle increased from 64. 0 % prior to transport to 68. 0 % <b>after</b> <b>transport</b> whereas the intestinal carriage rate for adult cattle increased from 6. 3 % prior to transport to 7. 3 % <b>after</b> <b>transport.</b> Campylobacter contamination of hides and carcasses in both feedlot and adult cattle was minimal.
