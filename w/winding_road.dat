5|$|One major {{challenge}} was {{the approach to}} the museum. The Japanese team proposed a <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E
5|$|Rivington is to {{the east}} to the M61 motorway, which connects the M6 and Preston to the north with the M60 and the Greater Manchester {{conurbation}} to the south. The nearest access is at Junction 6. The village is accessed by minor roads from Horwich {{to the south and}} Adlington to the west. A <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> to the north passes through Anglezarke and a road over the moors to the east leads to Belmont. The nearest places with regular bus services are Horwich to the south and Adlington to the west, which are served by buses between Bolton and Chorley or Preston.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Valley Drive, a narrow, <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> {{along the}} western bank of Skaneateles Creek {{in the town of}} Elbridge, was {{included}} in Route20, an unsigned legislative route extending from Rochester in the west to Elbridge in the east. The highway was gradually taken over by the state of New York, beginning with the segment between the Elbridge and Jordan village lines. This section of Valley Drive was legislatively designated as part of State Highway487 (SH487) and added to the state highway system on November2, 1908. The portion within Elbridge was included in the state highway system on December7, 1911, as part of SH5080. The Jordan segment was added to the state highway system as part of SH5630 sometime after 1920.|$|E

5|$|Live at the BBC, {{the first}} {{official}} release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project. Anthology {{was the culmination of}} work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title The Long and <b>Winding</b> <b>Road.</b> Documenting their history in the band's own words, the Anthology project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Martin oversaw {{post-production}} on The Beatles Anthology (which {{was originally}} entitled The Long and <b>Winding</b> <b>Road)</b> in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin {{decided to use}} an old 8-track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital deck. He explained this {{by saying that the}} old deck created a completely different sound, which a new deck could not accurately reproduce. He also said he found the whole project a strange experience (and McCartney agreed), as they had to listen to themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously.|$|E
5|$|SR 243 {{begins at}} SR 74 in the San Jacinto Wilderness near Mountain Center, Riverside County as Idyllwild Road. The highway {{traverses}} north along a <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> through {{the community of}} Idyllwild. SR 243 makes a left turn at the intersection with Circle Drive and continues through Pine Cove. The road continues through the forest past Mount San Jacinto State Park through Twin Pines and the Morongo Indian Reservation before making a few switchbacks and descending {{en route to the}} city of Banning as the Banning Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. The highway continues as San Gorgonio Avenue into the city before making a left onto Lincoln Street and a right onto 8th Street and terminating at a diamond interchange with I-10.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} with a <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> and a cart {{approaching}} an unnamed city and focuses {{on a pair of}} goitered elders, Don Chepe and Niña Tina, who are laden with the country's heritage. To stitch together the legends that compose the rest of the book told by these elders, the character, “Cuco de los Sueños,” is introduced. The narrator then tells two anecdotes, one about Brother Pedro de Betancourt and another about Fray Payo Enriquez de Rivera. Both stories emphasize transformation and contrasting elements. Asturias' main argument is that Guatemala is a nation built on nations and that change is possible.|$|E
25|$|Wellington {{is served}} by State Highway 1 {{in the west and}} State Highway 2 in the east, meeting at the Ngauranga Interchange north of the city centre, where SH 1 runs through the city to the airport. Road access into the capital is {{constrained}} by the mountainous terrain – between Wellington and the Kapiti Coast, SH 1 travels along the Centennial Highway, a narrow section of road, and between Wellington and Wairarapa SH 2 transverses the Rimutaka Ranges on a similar narrow <b>winding</b> <b>road.</b> Wellington has two motorways, both part of SH 1: the Johnsonville–Porirua Motorway and the Wellington Urban Motorway, which in combination with a small non-motorway section in the Ngauranga Gorge connect Porirua with Wellington city.|$|E
25|$|The route {{north of}} Wellington {{known as the}} Centennial Highway from Ngauranga to Paekakariki was started in 1936 and opened on 4 November 1939. The Centennial Highway project {{involved}} an upgrade of the Ngauranga Gorge road and provided a new route from Paremata to Paekakariki, bypassing the <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> along the southern harbour edge from Paremata to Pauatahanui and the tortuous narrow winding Paekakariki Hill Road between Pauatahanui and Paekakariki. It followed a new route, bridging the narrow channel between Paremata and the Mana isthmus and following {{the eastern edge of}} the Taupo swamp north of Plimmerton before climbing to the Pukerua Bay saddle and descending to follow the coastline to Paekakariki.|$|E

25|$|Southdown Motors {{operated}} three bus {{services at}} the time: no. 19 between Newick and Lewes via Barcombe Cross, and nos. 119 and 122 between Lewes and Uckfield via the A26 with a stop at Barcombe Lane. As a condition of the Minister's consent to closure, additional bus services were laid on from August 1968. No. 122 additionally called at Isfield Station and provided an hourly service to and from Uckfield, but no. 119 departed Uckfield two minutes before the incoming rail service arrived. Barcombe Mills and Isfield stations remained open to sell tickets. However, as the buses were unable to negotiate the narrow <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> to Barcombe Mills, they stopped one mile short of the station: BRB laid on taxis to ferry passengers to the bus stop, but passengers first had {{to walk to the}} station to buy their tickets.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{studies for}} a second Salang tunnel started in May 2012. USAID has started {{studying}} plans to construct the second tunnel in Salang {{and the cost of}} the project was expected to be specified after the study has been completed. USAID and the World Bank have shown an interest in helping pay the costs of the project. The new tunnel will decrease the problems of travelling on the Salang highway, on which seven thousand vehicles travel daily. Hence less risk of snow avalanches, and a less <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> in the new tunnel. The new tunnel will stretch further than the current tunnel, but the new road will be 30-40 kilometres shorter when comparing equal distances. The new tunnel will reach from the Olang region in Parwan province to DoShakh in Baghlan province, going through the mountains of the Hindu Kush.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} three ports of entry serving the metropolitan region. The San Ysidro Port of Entry/El Chaparral expansion projects, {{and the opening}} of the new Otay Mesa East Port of Entry, will add significant capacity. The most trafficked port of entry is the San Ysidro Port of Entry—the busiest international crossing in the world. It serves as the primary entry point for the commuting populace of the metropolitan region. The Cross Border Xpress pedestrian border crossing, which opened December 9, 2015, is for the exclusive use of ticketed passengers at Tijuana International Airport. Further east, the Otay Mesa Port of Entry deals with high volumes of commercial traffic as it is located in the manufacturing zone of the region. The Otay Mesa Port accounts for billions of dollars worth of product. Further east, the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry is planned. And the farthest east, the Tecate Port of Entry is the smallest port of entry and is not designed for dealing with large volumes of traffic as it follows a long <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> through the Mountain Empire.|$|E

25|$|On June 13, {{less than}} twelve {{hours after the}} Israeli-PLO ceasefire had gone into effect, it fell apart, and heavy {{fighting}} erupted around Khalde. As the fighting raged, an IDF armored unit struck northeast, attempting to bypass Khalde and advance on Baabda, which overlooked the airport and {{could be used as}} another staging point to cut the Beirut-Damascus highway. By June 14, Syrian forces were being deployed to Khalde. Syrian units in Beirut and three commando battalions armed with anti-tank weaponry took up defensive positions southwest of the airport to block any Israeli attempt to capture it. The Israelis attempted to flank these defenses by moving off the road past Shuweifat, up a narrow, steep, and <b>winding</b> <b>road</b> towards Baabda, but were ambushed by a Syrian commando battalion. The Syrians attacked Israeli armor with rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles at close range. Israeli infantry dismounted and engaged the Syrians. Fierce fighting took place, with the Israelis calling in artillery at very close range to themselves. The Israelis advanced relentlessly, and after fourteen hours of fierce combat that raged up through Ain Aanoub and Souq el-Gharb, they broke through the Syrian positions and entered Baabda. The IDF then immediately sent reinforcements to the column in Baabda to enable it to carry out further operations. From Baabda, the Israeli force split into three columns, one of which struck across the highway and entered the mountainous area to the northeast, one swung west and took up positions in the steep hills west of Beirut, and one turned toward Kahale, which was further down the highway. To the south, the IDF drove PLO forces out of Shuweifat, but no major battles occurred. The Israelis had now cut the Beirut-Damascus highway, cutting off all PLO and Syrian forces in the city.|$|E
