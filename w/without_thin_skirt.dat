The amostral population was submitted to one and two selective thinning, beyond a control sample, <b>without</b> <b>thinning.</b> The selective low thinning was conducted with reduction of the basal area to levels of 28 m 2 /ha.

50|$|An early {{method of}} {{disabling}} shaped charges developed during World War II was to apply <b>thin</b> <b>skirt</b> armor or meshwire {{at a distance}} around the hull and turret of the tank. The skirt or mesh armor (cage armor) triggers the RPG on contact {{and much of the}} molten jet that a shaped charge produces dissipates before coming into contact with the main armor of the vehicle. Well-sloped armor also gives some protection because the shaped charge is forced to penetrate a greater amount of armor due to the oblique angle. The benefits of cage armor are still considered great in modern battlefields in the Middle East, and although similar effects can be obtained using spaced armor, either {{as a part of the}} original design or as appliqué armor fitted later, cage armor is preferable due to its low weight and ease of repair.|$|R

Foram utilizados 20 bubalinos Murrah (15 meses de idade e peso inicial de 207 kg), castrados e descornados, divididos em quatro grupos homogêneos e abatidos aos 75, 100, 125, 150 dias de confinamento, após período de adaptação. Ao abate, as carcaças foram identificadas, resfriadas por 24 horas para pesagem e cálculo dos rendimentos das meias-carcaças, dos cortes dianteiro, ponta-de-agulha, traseiro total e serrote. Não houve diferença estatística para o rendimento de carcaça. Os pesos de traseiro total, serrote e dianteiro apresentaram aumento linear, porém, observou-se efeito cúbico do período de confinamento sobre os rendimentos de traseiro total e dianteiro. Verificou-se ainda aumento linear dos pesos de filé-mignon, contrafilé, fraldinha, coxão mole, coxão duro, lagarto, sebo, porção comestível e ossos. O período de confinamento promoveu efeito linear decrescente sobre os rendimentos de patinho, músculo traseiro e maminha + alcatra e linear crescente para fraldinha e sebo.

30|$|<b>Without</b> <b>thinning,</b> oak and {{red maple}} {{seedlings}} {{are caught in}} a fire trap (Grady and Hoffmann 2012). In our study, 80 % to 90 % of seedlings remained less than 30 cm tall after one or three fires. Although fire behavior was not assessed as an objective in this study, the fire temperatures we obtained were within the ranges reported by others for dormant season burns in Eastern deciduous forests (Franklin et al. 1997, Iverson et al. 2004, Phillips and Waldrop 2008), but may have been insufficient to cause mortality of shade-casting overstory trees. <b>Without</b> <b>thinning,</b> available light is too low to support rapid rates of height growth for either oaks or red maple, and frequent fire {{in the short term}} sets back shoot development. Burns that reduce post-fire seedling emergence of red maple have been documented (Glasgow and Matlack 2007), and Brose (2010) noted that seedling-origin dominant stems were only found in controls, not in any of the burn treatments. With thinning, oak seedlings that were burned also appeared to be caught in a fire trap, with fewer stems tallied in the largest size classes. There was no clear pattern for red maple seedlings under thinning and fire, as distribution among height classes was somewhat even. In these systems, juvenile sprouting must be considered part of the recruitment strategy. <b>Without</b> <b>thinning,</b> red maple sprouts were not trapped in the smaller size classes following one fire, a trend found elsewhere (Arthur et al. 1998, Albrecht and McCarthy 2006). With three fires, red maple sprouts were maintained as smaller stems. Under thinning, oak and maple sprouts responded favorably to one fire, with over 60 % of the sprouts in the largest size class for oak and over 90 % for maple; with three fires, oak sprouts did not recruit into larger sizes. The key to developing large oak advance reproduction is to have sufficient light in the understory and time between fires to permit positive net root growth. Then, when the oak seedling sprouts are competitive, they need further release from overstory competition and a fire-free period to allow for recruitment into the overstory. Reproduction needs to reach a threshold size before it can escape from fire. Longer fire-free periods (antecedent periods as described by Arthur et al. 2015) may allow seedlings and sprouts enough time to grow into a fire-resistant size (Jacqmain et al. 1999, Fan et al. 2012, Grady and Hoffman 2012).|$|R

Let alone a uni fied description {{of the dynamics of}} bubbles and drops, a full description of a single bubble/drop is out of our reach, as of now. The <b>thin</b> <b>skirted</b> bubbles, for instance, may rise axisymmetrically or may have travelling waves in azimuthal or vertical direction; may or may not remain axisymmetric; may eject satellite bubbles, or they may form wrinkles in their skirt. The length scales may vary across 3 or more orders of magnitude. A rising bubble may change its topology to become a toroidal bubble and become unstable to break into smaller bubbles, which may further break into even smaller bubbles. Bubbles which attain a terminal shape and velocity may change their fi nal behaviour depending on the initial conditions of release. Ellipsoidal bubbles, released axisymmetrically, may often take a zigzag or a spiral path as they rise. On the other hand, drops have a completely di ff erent dynamics. Drops have been studied due to their importance in atomization, rain drop size distribution, emulsi fi cation and many other problems of industrial importance. Apart from the low Reynolds number regime and density ratios close to 1, any literature seldom compares bubbles and drops because of the inherent difference in their dynamics.

The reflection dips of the metal-coated arrays were much broader and more pronounced {{than those of the}} bare arrays. The coated metal layers consisted of two parts—the metal disks on the Si NP top and the holey metal backreflectors on the Si substrate. The Mie-like geometrical resonance in the NPs, the localized surface plasmons in the metal disks, and the propagation of surface plasmon polariton along the backreflector/substrate interface could contribute to the reflection spectra. Finite-difference time-domain simulation results showed that the interplay of the plasmonic effects and the geometric resonance gave rise to significantly enhanced light confinement and consequent local absorption in the metal-Si hybrid nanostructures.|$|R
