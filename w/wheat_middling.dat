However when certain of these feeds are included in large quantity in chick rations a reduced growth rate has often resulted. Heuser et al. (1945) have shown a reduced, growth rate and decreased efficiency from the feeding of high fiber rations. Some of these rations contained bran and middlings. Mishler et al. (1946) found that when 10 percent each of wheat bran and standard <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> re-placed corn in a simplified corn and soy-bean oil meal ration, growth was retarded and more feed was required per unit of gain. Carrick and Roberts (1947) noted that when 10 percent each of wheat bran and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> replaced 20 percent ground yellow corn in a ration known to give rapid growth, feed efficiency and rate of growth decreased. Roberts and Carrick (1934) compared chick rations containing 30 percent of ground oats with rations containing 15 percent each of wheat bran and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings,</b> and found no important dif-ferences in growth rate, mortality, or feed efficiency.

Calves were offered supplement diet (180 g/kg CP and 100 g/kg roughage) and were weaned until their supplement intake reached 450 g/day for two consecutive days. Then after they were moved to another pen and provided with hay ad libiitum and concentrate equivalent to 1. 5 % of their body weight for three months. Subsequently they were moved to feedlot and were provided teff straw, ad libiitum and, supplemented with one kg/day concentrate diet (<b>wheat</b> <b>middling)</b> until one year of age.

30|$|Fresh feces were {{collected}} from 6 wild takins in Labahe Nature Reserve (30 ° 18 ′N 102 ° 27 ′E) and 6 captive takins in Chengdu Zoo (Chengdu, Sichuan, China) from late September to October. An adult female takin (subject A, 13 -year-old), an adult male takin (subject B, 8 -year-old), and a young male takin (subject C, 3 -year-old) housed separately at the Chengdu Zoo were also monitored over a half-year period. In January 5, March 2, April 27 and June 19, fecal samples {{were collected}} from the three takins respectively. The Sichuan takins housed in Chengdu Zoo were fed a constant and balanced diet, which refer to standards for maintenance requirement of cattle and sheep. Their daily diet of captive animals consisted of 20 – 25  kg green fodder (perennial ryegrass or Sudangrass), 2.5  kg alfalfa bale, 2  kg chopped alfalfa hay and 2  kg concentrate. The composition of the concentrate was 39 % corn, 13 % rice bran, 2 % fish meal, 4 % <b>wheat</b> <b>middling,</b> 15 % wheat bran, 8 % soybean meal, 12 % cracked soybean, 1.5 % hydrolyzed feather meal, 1.5 % calcium carbonate, 2 % dicalcium phosphate, 0.8 % sodium chloride and 1.2 % microelements and vitamins. For the reason of animal conservation, sampling work was accomplished by specific zoo keepers in Chengdu or staff at the reserve. Fresh fecal samples were immediately collected upon defecation around feeding time or {{in the process of}} feeding salts by park rangers. Samples were sealed in sterile plastic bags, transported to the laboratory in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −[*] 70  °C until analysis.|$|E
40|$|Seis novilhos &frac 12; sangue Holandês-Zebu castrados, fistulados no rúmen e no abomaso, foram distribuídos em dois quadrados latinos 3 x 3 (três animais, três níveis de oferta - 1, 5; 2, 0 e 2, 5 % PV e três períodos) para determinar os consumos e as digestibilidades totais e parciais dos carboidratos totais (CHO), da fibra em detergente neutro (FDN) e dos carboidratos não-fibrosos (CNF). As digestibilidades foram determinadas com óxido crômico. Os consumos de CHO, FDN, CNF e NDT (kg/dia) e de CHO, FDN e CNF (% do peso vivo - PV) aumentaram linearmente com os níveis de oferta. O teste de identidade de modelos, realizado para as equações de regressão para as digestibilidades total, ruminal e intestinais dos CHO, em função dos níveis de oferta, indicou não existir diferenças entre as metodologias de coleta. As digestibilidades total, ruminal e intestinais dos CHO não foram influenciadas pelos tratamentos. A digestibilidade total da FDN diminuiu linearmente com o aumento dos níveis de oferta, enquanto as digestões ruminal e intestinais da FDN não foram influenciadas pelos tratamentos. Não foi observado efeito dos níveis de oferta para as digestibilidades totais dos CNF. Utilizando a metodologia de coleta de digesta no omaso, foi observado aumento linear da digestibilidade ruminal dos CNF. Quando foi usada a coleta no abomaso, não houve efeito do aumento do consumo sobre a digestão ruminal dos CNF. A coleta de digesta abomasal pode ser substituída pela coleta de digesta omasal, via fístula ruminal. A coleta de digesta omasal é vantajosa, tornando o estudo de digestão parcial um processo menos invasivo. Six half-bred &frac 12; Holstein-Zebu steers, fistulated in the rumen and abomasum, were {{randomly}} assigned to two 3 x 3 Latin squares (animal, ingestion regime - 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 % LW and period) to determine the intake and total and partial digestibility of total carbohydrates (CHO), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and non fiber carbohydrates (NFC). Chromic oxide was used as a marker to determine the digestibilities. Animals were fed diet with 60 % Tifton- 85 bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) hay and 40 % concentrate mixture (corn starch, <b>wheat</b> <b>middling,</b> soybean meal, urea and minerals), were used. Intakes CHO, NDF, NFC and TDN (kg/day, %LW) linearly increased with the ingestion regimes. The identity model test, used to estimate the regression equations for the total, ruminal and intestinal digestibilities of CHO, in function of the ingestion regime, showed no differences among collection methods. Total, ruminal and intestinal carbohydrates digestibilities were not affected by the treatments. Neutral detergent fiber total digestibility linearly decreased as the ingestion regime increased, while NDF ruminal and intestinal digestibilities were not affected by the treatments. No effect of ingestion regime was observed for the NFC total digestibilities. A linear increase of NFC ruminal digestibility was observed by using the omasal method of digesta collection. When the abomasal method of digesta collection was used, no effect of increased intake on the NFC ruminal digestibility was observed. Abomasal method of digesta collection could be replaced by omasal method of digesta collection, by ruminal fistula. Omasal method of Digesta collection is an efficient method, becoming the study of partial digestion a less invasive process...|$|E

In Exp. 2, pigs were fed diets with 32 % DDGS and 32 % <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> and were mix for 0, 15, 30, 60, or 420 s. There were no differences in growth performance or carcass measurements as mix time was increased from 0 to 420 s (P > 0. 06). In Exp. 3, pigs were fed 32 % DDGS and 32 % <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> in meal and pelleted diets that were mixed for 0 or 180 s. Pelleting diets increased ADG and improved G/F (P > 0. 01). Increasing mix time had no effect on ADG or G/F (P > 0. 16) as mix time was increased from 0 to 180 s. There were no differences in carcass measurements because of diet form or mix time.
