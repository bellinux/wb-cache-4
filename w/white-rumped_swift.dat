5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{straightforward}} to identify. The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> {{is similar to}} Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary {{to be sure of}} correct identification.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E

50|$|<b>White-rumped</b> <b>swifts</b> {{breed in}} much of sub-Saharan Africa, and have {{expanded}} into Morocco and southern Spain. The populations in Spain, Morocco and the south of Africa are migratory, although their wintering grounds are not definitively known. Birds in tropical Africa are resident apart from seasonal movements.|$|R
50|$|Other {{breeding}} birds {{for which the}} park is important are black stork and Eurasian eagle owl {{and there is a}} high density of azure-winged magpie. It {{is also one of the}} few locations in Europe where <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> breed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus caffer) {{is a small}} swift. Although {{this bird}} is superficially similar to a house martin, it is not closely related to that {{passerine}} species. The resemblances between the swallows and swifts are due to convergent evolution reflecting similar life styles.|$|E

50|$|The red-breasted swallow {{builds a}} closed mud nest with a tubular {{entrance}} in a cavity or under bridges and similar structures. It will use deserted buildings, tree holes or caves, and {{has benefited from}} the construction of railway bridges and similar structures. It is generally a solitary species and pairs rarely breed in groups. Three eggs is a typical clutch. These birds feed on insects which are almost all caught {{in the air and}} the species rarely lands on the ground rather perching on wires and twigs. The typical flight is slow and buoyant. Like the closely related red-rumped and mosque swallows the nests of the red-breasted swallow are often usurped by the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swift.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Horus swift is 13-15 cm {{long and}} quite bulky. It appears entirely blackish {{except for a}} white patch on the chin and a white rump. It has a medium length forked tail. It has a {{fluttering}} flight like little swift. Little swift has a square tail, and more extensive white on the rump than Horus, and <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> has a more deeply forked tail and a narrower white band. The call is a buzzing peeeeooo, peeeeooo. The paler subspecies A. h. fuscobrunneus of southwestern Angola has a small grey throat patch and a brown rump. The form toulsoni of northwestern Angola and Zimbabwe is a dark morph of nominate A. h. horus, with a dark rump and small throat patch. Both dark forms have sometimes been split as separate species.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe avian fauna of Ulleungdo (Is.) was studied between June of 2006 and July of 2010, and {{the results}} {{gathered}} over 10 study session included a total of 18, 046 individuals of 92 species. Dominant species included, in decreasing order, black-tailed gull (Larus crassirostris) at 13, 188 individuals (73. 1 %), russet sparrow (Passer rutilans) at 1, 278 individuals (7. 08 %), and <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus pacificus) at 900 individuals (4. 99 %). In terms {{of the time of}} the year, the highest numbers of species were detected in May of 2007 at 50 species and the highest numbers of birds were detected in February of 2009 at 4, 137 individuals. In relation to endangered species designated by the Ministry of Environment, the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Eurasian buzzard (Buteo buteo) were detected, and natural monument species designated by the Cultural Heritage Administration including the Japanese wood pigeon (Columba janthina), grey frog hawk (Accipiter soloensis), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), peregrine falcon, oriental scops owl (Otus scops), mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) and the little cuckoo(Cuculus poliocephalus) were detected. Compared to previous studies, a total of 33 new species, including the red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) and the Swinhoe's fork-tailed petrel (Oceanodroma monorhis), were observed...|$|E
