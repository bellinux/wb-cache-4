With help from other inspectors like Estyn (for education) and the Care and Social Services Inspectorate for Wales, we have brought together {{a picture of what}} the council is trying to achieve; how it is going about it; and what it needs to do to improve its approach to improving services. This Annual Improvement Report sets out that picture and each year we will produce a report to let you know what progress Torfaen County Borough Council (the Council) has made. We have not covered all the services the Council provides. We have focused on a small number of things, especially those things that the Council has said are its priorities for improvement. We {{want to find out what}} you think of the services the Council is providing in your area and will be giving you an opportunity to comment in the future.

Phenazepam is a benzodiazepine which is currently not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (1971 Act) in the UK. Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs's advice: The UK Government has received independent expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) that phenazepam is sufficiently harmful to justify an immediate import ban under the Open General Import Licence pending its control as a Class C drug under the 1971 Act. The ACMD’s assessment reports that phenazepam is being marketed as a so called ‘legal high’ product, particularly on the internet. It {{has been identified as}} being a potent member of the benzodiazepine family causing harms such as amnesia and drowsiness that may potentially proceed to a coma with respiratory depression. Whilst phenazepam has been recognised to have limited medicinal properties, it is not prescribed in the UK for treatment neither does it have a UK marketing authorisation. Further, it has no legitimate commercial or industrial uses in the UK. This amendment to the Open General Import Licence will remain in place until such time as it is revoked. This will likely occur when phenazepam is fully controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 where it will be a criminal offence to unlawfully import, export, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply and be in simple possession of this substance without a licence or lawful authority.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful, chronic, non-inflammatory disease affecting 140 million people worldwide that alters synovial joint structure and function. OA progressively breaks down hyaline cartilage, the hydrated tissue that provides a smooth, nearly frictionless surface and distributes loads applied to articulating joint surfaces. The loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from the extracellular matrix of cartilage is an early marker of OA. Therefore, imaging methods that quantify the GAG content of cartilage are of interest. This work investigates the synthesis and development of three cationic contrast agents (CAs) for imaging articular cartilage (AC) : CA 4 +, an iodinated small molecule, and tantalum oxide nanoparticles (Ta 2 O 5 NPs) for x-ray Computed Tomography (CT) imaging; and Gadopentetate-dilysine (Gd(DTPA) Lys 2), a gadolinium small molecule for Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging. These cationic contrast agents are attracted to the strong negative fixed charge of extracellular GAG and, therefore, infiltrate cartilage. This work begins with an overview of CT and MR imaging basic principles, current clinical CAs and contrast enhanced imaging of AC. First, the large-scale (50 g) synthesis of CA 4 + is described and the partitioning over time of CA 4 + into ex vivo AC is correlated to GAG content and cartilage mechanical properties. Similar partitioning studies are applied to anionic, neutral and cationic Ta 2 O 5 NPs, where the cationic NP exhibited substantially greater affinity for AC. Moreover, by maintaining the positive charge on the NP surface and introducing a polyethylene glycol coating, a NP formulation is described for successful in vivo cartilage imaging. Next described is the MRI CA, Gd(DTPA) Lys 2, which affords an equivalent T 1 signal in cartilage at 1 / 10 th the effective dosage of anionic gadopentetate. Finally, the equilibrium partitioning of the small molecule CT and MRI CAs is directly compared to GAG content and mechanical properties in human finger AC. In summary, results show cationic CAs strongly correlate to both GAG and mechanical properties and distribute in direct proportion to GAG unlike anionic CAs. The use of cationic CAs to quantify the biochemical and mechanical changes of AC may aid drug discovery and improve clinical assessment and intervention of OA for future patients. 2017 - 11 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E

We know that Wm J Godfrey Eneas in Barbados was actually reading Spore 78 when we called him by surprise on a Saturday morning to discuss his book on his country's agriculture (English edition, Spore 78). We know that the teacher in the Port Royal school in Jamaica had read, in someone else's copy, about the school garden in Gabon (see Spore 77), when we met by chance-again on a Saturday morning. And {{we know that the}} Readers' Committee in Ségou, Mali-which we think meets on a Saturday morning-has about one hundred members (see Mailbox in Spore 79). Maybe there are other readers' clubs, let us know. Maybe each copy of Spore has one reader, except for the Ségou Club, and the Jamaican teacher's friend. Or maybe four readers or more: farmers, researchers, village savings club managers, radio presenters, vets, exporters, NGO members, technicians, bureaucrats, diplomats, ministers, [...] . Maybe you are one of 26, 101 readers, or of 100, 000. We don't know, but when we get more precise figures with your help next year, we shall share them with you. What {{we do know is that}} you have news and views, questions and answers. With this new section, we can give you more space. We also want to tell you not only about the events and publications we support (described throughout Spore), but also about other CTA services and new areas of work, which you can use, and help to shape.

40|$|INTRODUCTION One of {{the first}} things we agreed to as an {{editorial}} staff was that our university???s literary journal needed an updated title. There was nothing inherently wrong with the name Island Fox, per se, but we preferred something that might better demonstrate the joie de vivre of writing. After batting about a few names, we settled on MYUZ ??? a nod of appreciation to the nine daughters of Zeus ??? the Greek goddesses of artistic inspiration. A muse is something (or someone) every writer needs ??? an inspirational influence to whisper in their ear, to help lift their words and voice above the mundane. During this past year, newspapers, television, and internet blogs have been filled with bad news ??? some of it terrifying. Here in Ventura County we were jolted by the huge loss of life in the Chatsworth Metrolink crash ??? the worst train accident in California history. We have decided to open our journal this year with a non-fiction piece by Joshua Bauer that deals with this tragedy. Bauer begins his first person narrative with a group of friends getting together for a few games of bowling. The Metrolink disaster, which had happened just two days before, is not really on their radar. The story takes a dramatic turn when Katie, a young woman who had been quiet all evening, suddenly reveals the news that a friend of theirs from high school was one of the Metrolink victims. Another short story you???ll be sure to want to check out is Bishara, Avi, Always, Kristi Kellog???s narrative of what happens when a conservative Hindu boy meets a worldly Indian girl hell-bent on winning a major beauty contest. Poetry is well represented in this year???s journal, making up about one-half of the entries. Adam Piccirilli electrifies us with his love poem Arc Eyes, Sara Parker introduces us to the horrors of nursing home life in A Part of Adulthood I???d Rather Avoid, and Krista Wilbur, last year???s managing editor, takes us into the dark, blood-stained alleys of poesie noir with Kaleidoscope. Current events were popular with our submitters this year; Sara Parker comes through again, delivering a sarcastic political elbow-punch with Hooray For Proposition 8, Chris O???Neal tells us the advantages of pet ownership during a recessionary economy in Do Rabbits Dream of Electric People, and Sean Colletti???s esoteric Now Serving Number 44 will have you puzzling over its meaning. Look closely ??? the clues are there. Our editorial committee offers up their own contributions, of course. MYUZ???s mamma capa, Kellie Griffin, brings us into the lives of two young friends {{on their way to a}} blood test in Transposition, Julie Fontes shows us what can happen when you meet up with your past at a downtown club in And Hearts, and Guy MacLaury illustrates the perils of beachcombing after dark in Jamaica with A Walk on the Seven Mile Beach. In addition, Luis Maranan takes us into the gravity-prone forest of One Hundred Hills, there???s the aforementioned reflective non-fiction short story from Joshua Bauer ??? Spared ??? and George Morgan squeezes in a few pages with a story about cul-de-sac culture, helicopters, and Polynesian cannabis in Where the Road Ends. We broke some new ground this year, using technology in innovative ways. This is the first time the CSUCI literary journal has been published by an online publishing company: lulu. com. This will allow copies of MYUZ to be available in perpetuity. All in all we believe our readers will enjoy the writing in this year???s campus journal. It???s been a pleasure putting it together.
