5000|$|DeBlanc {{attempted}} to disengage but {{was attacked by}} two more [...] "Oscars". He turned towards them in a climbing head-on attack, and the first exploded in the exchange of fire. The second maneuvered behind him, however, but DeBlanc managed to slow his Wildcat abruptly and force his remaining opponent to overshoot him, and he also shot it down for his fifth victory of the day. DeBlanc was then surprised by a fighter he had not detected. Rounds struck his aircraft, ripped his wrist watch from his arm, smashed the instrument panel, and set afire the <b>Wildcat's</b> <b>engine.</b> DeBlanc was forced to bail out at low altitude over Vella Gulf near Japanese-held Kolombangara. The total time of the action from arrival in the target area to his own bailout was approximately five minutes.|$|R
25|$|Under the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger <b>engine</b> <b>Wildcat,</b> Electra 225 and Riviera.|$|R
50|$|After {{providing}} {{air cover}} for an Okinawa-bound amphibious group, Anzio joined other {{forces in the}} vicinity of Kerama Retto in seizing that island group to provide an advanced base for the Fleet. The Okinawa attack began on 1 April, and she remained on line until she retired to Ulithi on 30 April for repairs to her rudder bearings. On 21 May, the carrier resumed ASW operations in the Okinawa area. This role ended on 17 June, when she sailed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for upkeep after finding that her aviation fuel tanks had been contaminated during a replenishment at sea. One TBM didn't get a radio heads-up in time when a pair of <b>Wildcats</b> encountered <b>engine</b> problems right after takeoff and had to ditch when it switched to its spare fuel tank. Anzio dumped her thousands of gallons of bad gas overboard before pulling into Leyte, and this caused a passing outbound carrier to radio with concern when they smelled the fumes.|$|R
