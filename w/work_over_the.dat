5|$|Evidently {{there was}} a burst in {{overlapping}} commitments and commission, both public and ecclesiastical, {{many of which were}} more important than his debut work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Indeed, work in that church stopped around the same time. The sculptor returned to it only for occasional <b>work</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> following years {{to the end of the}} century; overall, however, work ceased until the mid-sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In 1891, Thomas {{decided to}} set up a {{business}} in organ-building and the family moved to London. There, Casson was educated at St Mary's College, Paddington before going to secretarial college at her father's behest. After qualifying, she worked as a secretary for her fathers' organ-building business until his retirement. In 1908, Casson was a working as housing manager for the social reformer, Octavia Hill, taking care of the living conditions of residents at Red Cross Hall in Southwark. For the next five years she organised recreational activities at the hall, focusing on the arts. Octavia Hill's philosophy influenced Casson's <b>work</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> following years.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, Japan, {{which had}} invaded and {{occupied}} French Indochina in 1941 during World War II, {{decided to take}} direct control and overthrew the French colonial regime. Thơ was thrown into a crowded cell with several other prisoners that had no light or toilet and filled with their own excrement. One of his cellmates was Dương Văn Minh, then a junior officer in the French military forces with whom he would <b>work</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next two decades. Thơ was released first and lobbied to have Minh released as well and the pair remained close friends.|$|E
5|$|Suitable {{work for}} the class began to decline under British Railways {{ownership}} after the widening of bridges and tunnels on the Hastings line, which enabled Bulleid's powerful Q1class 0-6-0 to be used on freight trains between Hastings and Tonbridge. Following {{the completion of the}} Kent Coast electrification in 1959, the class was congregated at Tonbridge shed alongside members of the U1class to haul local services throughout the Central section. The reduction of <b>work</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London. However, with remaining work being allocated to Bulleid's Light Pacifics, the class was withdrawn from service in November 1962.|$|E

Before working on the book, Hergé would make sketches in pencil; subsequently he would <b>work</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> drawings and text in ink.

5|$|On Mono Island, {{the main}} landing {{along the south}} coast had been {{achieved}} with relative ease, with few casualties although they had to fend off some attacks that night. However, Logan Force which had landed as planned at Soanotalu, {{on the opposite side}} of the island to 29th and 36th Battalions, experienced some difficulty. Initially unopposed, a defensive perimeter had been established and the American technicians got to <b>work.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> next three days, some contact had been made with Japanese soldiers, which had evaded the New Zealanders to the south, looking to escape the island by seizing a barge. During the evening of 1 November, a party of 80 Japanese, began attacking Logan Force. A small group of six soldiers from 34th Battalion plus three Americans held a blockhouse throughout the night and by dawn, over 50 Japanese had been killed for the loss of five men. By early November, Japanese resistance had largely been overcome although patrols still made contact with small parties of Japanese and on 12 November, Mono Island was considered to be secure. By this stage, the battalion had reassembled on Mono Island. There were still isolated Japanese that needed to be captured or killed and patrols were ongoing well into January 1944. By this stage, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. Reidy, taking over from Eyre who was now too old for active service and had returned to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{musical score}} for the action {{role-playing}} game Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off game called Final Fantasy Versus XIII, was composed primarily by Yoko Shimomura, whose previous work included Parasite Eve, Legend of Mana, and the Kingdom Hearts series. Final Fantasy XV was her first time composing for the Final Fantasy series, so she took a more tentative approach than her Kingdom Hearts projects. Shimomura was involved with the project when XV was still titled Versus XIII, being hired to composed the music in 2006 and staying on through its ten-year development cycle. In 2010, Shimomura was still forming a framework for the game's music, ensuring that the music fitted the game without it solidifying into an image that seemed wrong. Her <b>work</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> time prior to its rebranding as Final Fantasy XV was fairly sporadic. Shimomura worked on around 80% of the music: the rest were variations on her work and other themes created by others involved in the soundtrack. Other composers {{who worked on the}} game were Tetsuya Shibata, Yoshino Aoki, Yoshitaka Suzuki and Mitsuhiro Ohta; the latter two assisted with arrangements.|$|E
