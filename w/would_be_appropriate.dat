5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds {{depends upon the}} needs of a specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, accrual basis accounting <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> to show the fund's profitability. Accrual basis is also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the profitability of those investments would be important.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts {{on the advice}} of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do so <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E

5|$|Sometime {{after the}} December 1920 hearing {{requested}} by the ANA, {{the chairman of the}} U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action.|$|E

25|$|A variable-ratio {{schedule}} of reinforcement, where {{the frequency of}} reinforcement varies unpredictably, can be also be highly effective if used in instances where it is ethical to do so. Providing praise on a variable-ratio schedule <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate,</b> whereas paying an employee on an unpredictable variable-ratio schedule would not be.|$|E

5000|$|The money <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriated</b> to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation {{and other}} U.S. Department of the Interior {{projects}}, and Department of Energy projects.

25|$|Furthermore, {{according}} to an August 10–11 Fox News poll, 64% of Americans (a majority of each of Democrats (56–38%), Republicans (76–17%), and Independents (53–41%)) {{thought it would be}} wrong to build a mosque and Islamic cultural center so close to Ground Zero, and 30% felt it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Laprade {{first made}} many {{drawings}} of local architectural motifs {{in an effort}} to understand the interaction of stylistic elements with social functions. His goal was to develop an elegant urban architecture based on modern technology that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> to the stylistic tastes and way of life of the Moroccan people.|$|E
25|$|The noun is {{normally}} used anyway {{when referring to}} specific sets of people (five Frenchmen, a few Spaniards), although the adjective may be used especially {{in case of a}} group of mixed or unspecified sex, if the demonym nouns are gender-specific: there were five French (or French people) in the bar (if neither Frenchmen or Frenchwomen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate).</b>|$|E

25|$|For most of {{his adult}} life, Senator Calvin Ruck lobbied to get the Canadian {{government}} to award a medal posthumously to Jerry Jones. Senator Ruck argued that the racist climate of the time precluded Jones or other black soldiers from getting their due recognition, and he felt that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the government to award the medal to Jones on behalf of all black veterans. Senator Ruck died in 2004, without achieving success.|$|E
25|$|In {{the current}} cases, Chief Justice Kiefel has {{expressed}} some {{doubt as to}} whether special counts <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate,</b> given the time that has elapsed since the members concerned were elected back in July 2016. In addition, {{a number of the}} candidates most likely to succeed in any potential special counts might be disqualified by other parts of s 44. A possible alternative raised by some is to have special Senate elections in the four affected States.|$|E
25|$|In February 1882, C. A. L. Totten (then a 1st {{lieutenant}} in the U.S. Army) wrote to both the Secretaries of State and Treasury to suggest some sort of commemoration for the Great Seal, which was to have its centennial later that year, in particular including {{a version of the}} never-cut and rarely seen reverse side. The State Department demurred, but the Treasury Department (having the ability to act without express permission of Congress) decided that a commemorative medal <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> and agreed to make one later that year.|$|E
60|$|To these annuities, I {{would also}} request the Parliament {{of this nation}} to allow the benefit of two lotteries yearly; by which the {{hospital}} would gain two hundred thousand pounds clear. Nor can such a request seem any way extraordinary, since it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriated</b> {{to the benefit of}} fools and knaves, which is the sole cause of granting one for this present year.|$|R

25|$|In {{chromaticity}} diagrams, a {{line that}} has constant perceived hue must be curved, so that the Abney effect is accounted for. The chromaticity diagrams that have been corrected for the Abney effect are therefore excellent illustrations of the non-linear nature of the visual system. Also, the Abney effect does not disallow any and all straight lines on chromaticity diagrams. One may mix two monochromatic lights and not see a shift in hue, thereby suggesting a straight-line plot for the different levels of mixture <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> on a chromaticity diagram.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} originally {{suggested that}} affiliate links work {{best in the}} context of the information contained within the website itself. For instance, if a website contains information pertaining to publishing a website, an affiliate link leading to a merchant's internet service provider (ISP) within that website's content <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate.</b> If a website contains information pertaining to sports, an affiliate link leading to a sporting goods website may work well with{{in the context of}} the articles and information about sports. The goal in this case is to publish quality information within the website and provide context-oriented links to related merchant's websites.|$|E

Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E

It is today part of Uasin Gishu County and last bore its name as a county of Eldoret South Constituency.

It was later split in two and is today named after the Tinderet and Nandi Hills.|$|R

25|$|Accepting that {{significant}} capital investment {{was required to}} replace the worn-out tramway with buses, the Citizen's Board was granted permission in February 1948 to raise a loan of £1,350,000, subject to approval by plebiscite. As elections for the Board were due later that year, {{it was decided to}} run the poll for the loan at the same time. While there was debate as to what mix of diesel and trolley buses <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> in any new system, the Labour Party questioned whether the loan was even affordable: a strategy which saw the loan rejected and a slim Labour majority returned to the Board.|$|E
25|$|However, {{tensions}} between the Farnese and other Italian nobility were not limited to local events in Parma. Historian Leopold von Ranke gives an account of a 1639 visit to Rome by Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza. The Duke arrived in Rome to great fanfare - he was given gifts and escorted around the city by Pope Urban's Cardinal-nephews, Antonio Barberini and Francesco Barberini. But the Duke refused to pay due deference to the Pope's other nephew; the newly appointed Prefect of Rome, Taddeo Barberini. As the Duke prepared to leave, he suggested that an escort from the city (ordinarily reserved for the Grand Duke of Tuscany) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Francesco Barberini refused. The Duke took his leave but urged the Pope to chastise both Cardinal-nephews.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Melba {{embarked}} on an affair with Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans. They were seen frequently together in London, which excited some gossip, but far more suspicion arose when Melba travelled across Europe to St Petersburg to sing for Tsar Nicholas II: the Duke followed closely behind her, and they were spotted together in Paris, Brussels, Vienna and St Petersburg. Armstrong filed divorce proceedings {{on the grounds of}} Melba's adultery, naming the Duke as co-respondent; he was eventually persuaded to drop the case, but the Duke decided that a two-year African safari (without Melba) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate.</b> He and Melba did not resume their relationship. In {{the first years of the}} decade, Melba appeared in the leading European opera houses, including Milan, Berlin and Vienna.|$|E
