The {{attitude}} and tactics of Drummond and Cauty's partnership matched {{that of the}} fictional cult whose name they had adopted. Throughout the partnership, these tactics were often interpreted by media commentators as [...] "Situationist pranks" [...] or [...] "publicity stunts". However, according to Drummond, [...] "That's {{just the way it}} was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever going to believe us, but we never felt <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct." [...] Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, [...] "I think it worked because we really meant it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{was common}} with inclement conditions, the game {{featured}} many punts {{and very few}} passes. The teams combined for 274 yards {{on the ground and}} only 73 yards in the air. Cannon was the game's leading rusher with 53 yards on thirteen carries, but he also fumbled twice, both times deep in LSU territory. [...] "We had to wait for the rain to stop before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> warm up," [...] Cannon remembered, [...] "and when it finally quit raining, things weren't much better. They had these plank bridges over pools of water and slop to get you onto the field." [...] His first fumble came in the first quarter at the LSU twenty, but the Bandits were able to hold Mississippi State to a missed field goal attempt. His second fumble was in the fourth quarter at the 13, and the Tigers again were able to hold the Maroons to a missed field goal.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, we got lost," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I did {{not take}} notice {{of the name of}} our hotel when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> so we could not find our way home again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Ned," [...] Mr. Cartwright said firmly, [...] "they {{must wait}} a little longer. The others may still be hiding close {{ready to make a}} rush if we come out; besides, it would likely enough be said of us that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> killed the wounded; we must wait awhile." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the chest}} came an overpowering spicy odour, {{and with it}} a veritable breath of warm air before which we recoiled a little. Bickley took a pocket {{thermometer}} which he had at hand and glanced at it. It marked a temperature of 82 degrees in the sepulchre. Having noted this, he thrust it into the coffin between the crystal wall and its occupant. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> waited {{a little while to}} give the odours time to dissipate, for they made the head reel.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't any use {{for us to}} try to do anything," [...] said Dick, disconsolately. [...] "Newcombe {{will stay}} right where he is until <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> the best {{thing we can do is}} give the thing up for a while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Millicent!" [...] he breathed. Then, {{after a long}} silence: [...] "We'll {{laugh at}} cold-blooded {{prudence}} and take our chances. It's a wide world, and we'll find a nook; somewhere if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> look for it. All my care will be to smooth the trail for you, dear." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{wanted a}} partner, so Andy and me {{agreed to go}} out together. I {{told him about the}} {{situation}} in Fisher Hill and how finances was low on account of the local mixture of politics and jalap. Andy had just got in on the train that morning. He was pretty low himself, and was going to canvass the whole town for a few dollars to build a new battleship by popular subscription at Eureka Springs. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> sat on the porch and talked it over.|$|E
6000|$|All {{night long}} the people drew on from every side towards the kraal, and, {{as they came}} in {{thousands}} and tens of thousands, they filled the night with their cries, till {{it seemed as though}} the whole world were mourning, and loudly. None might cease their crying, and none dared to drink so much as a cup of water. The daylight came, and Chaka rose, saying, [...] "Come, let us go forth, Mopo, and look on those who mourn with us." [...] So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> after us came men armed with clubs to do the bidding of the king.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> on, {{passing a}} public-house crowded {{with women who}} had left their babies in charge of {{children}} in the icy street. It was a day of Intercession for the success of England in the war. This was placarded everywhere. We entered, or, rather, Oro did, I following him, one of the churches in the Strand where an evening service was in progress. The preacher in the pulpit, a very able man, was holding forth upon the necessity for national repentance and self-denial; also of prayer. In the body of the church exactly thirty-two people, most of them elderly women, were listening to him with an air of placid acceptance.|$|E

6000|$|After a {{few moments}} of explanation, I {{suggested}} that <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> hear the singing of the [...] "troupe." [...] To this she consented, and rose quietly--she never did anything hurriedly or with girlish alertness--and put on her hat. Although so young, she had the dignity of a woman, and her face, pale as a silver moon, was calm and sweet, only her big gray eyes expressed the maiden mystery. She read my adoration and was a little afraid of it.|$|R

6000|$|We {{took the}} train for Manchester, over {{pretty much the}} same route that I {{travelled}} last year. Many of the higher hills in Yorkshire were white with snow, which, in our lower region, softened into rain; but as we approached Manchester, the western sky reddened, and gave promise of better weather. We arrived at nearly eight o'clock, and put up at the Palatine Hotel. In the evening I scrawled away at my journal till past ten o'clock; for I have really made it a matter of conscience to keep a tolerably full record of my travels, though conscious that everything good escapes in the process. In the morning <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> visited the ...|$|E
6000|$|There is some {{question}} among other authorities which {{window of the}} Banquetting House the doomed king passed through upon the scaffold to the block; but the custodian had no doubts. He would not allow a choice of windows, and as to a space broken through the wall, {{he had never heard}} of it. But we were so well satisfied with his window as to shrink involuntarily from it, and from the scene without whose eternal substance showed through the shadowy illusion of passing hansoms and omnibuses, like the sole fact of the street, the king's voice rising above the noises in tender caution to a heedless witness, [...] "Have a care of the axe; have a care," [...] and then gravely to the headsman: [...] "When I stretch out my hands so, then--" [...] The drums were ordered beaten, so that we could not hear more; and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> crossed among the cabs and 'busses to the horse-guards sitting shrunken on their steeds, and passed between them into the park beyond where the beds of flowers spread their soft autumnal bloom in the low sun of the September day.|$|E
6000|$|One morning, as we {{were sitting}} at breakfast, Mr. Carter's servant {{informed}} us {{that there was an}} [...] "Amok" [...] in the village--in other words, that a man was [...] "running a muck." [...] Orders were immediately given to shut and fasten the gates of our enclosure; but hearing nothing for some time, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> found there had been a false alarm, owing to a slave having run away, declaring he would [...] "amok," [...] because his master wanted to sell him. A short time before, a man had been killed at a gaming-table because, having lost half-a-dollar more than he possessed, he was going to [...] "amok." [...] Another had killed or wounded seventeen people before he could be destroyed. In their wars a whole regiment of these people will sometimes agree to [...] "amok," [...] and then rush on with such energetic desperation as to be very formidable to men not so excited as themselves. Among the ancients these would have been looked upon as heroes or demigods who sacrificed themselves for their country. Here it is simply said--they made [...] "amok." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope your}} neck doesn't stiffen up," [...] the editor wished solicitously: [...] "What {{do you say}} <b>we</b> all <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> have a drink on it--not the neck, of course, but the little rough-house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we might}} do that, {{but it would be}} a heavy loss to some poor fellow. Well, I shall look forward to the morning, when <b>we</b> can <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> see all about the prison arrangements." ...|$|R

Twice <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> twice {{returned}} empty-handed, while many of our lodges were empty.

This year, we said perhaps the Great Spirit {{will no longer be}} angry with his children, and we went out. This time we have not returned empty-handed. The lowing of cattle is in my ear, and I see many sheep. The white men have felt the strength of our arms; and of the young men who went out with me there is not one missing. Best of all, we have brought back a captive, the daughter of the white chief of the flying fires and the guns which load themselves. Let me hand her over to our women; they will know how to make her cry; and we will send her head to the white chief, to show that his guns cannot reach to the Indian country.

60|$|Accordingly, {{when the}} feast was over I said that I desired {{to walk in}} the gardens with the princess Otomie, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> wandered under the solemn trees, that are draped in a winding-sheet of grey moss which, hanging from every bough as though the forest had been decked with the white beards of an army of aged men, waved and rustled sadly in the keen night air. But alas! we might not be alone, for after us at a {{distance}} of twenty paces followed all my crowd of attendant nobles, together with fair dancing girls and minstrels armed with their accursed flutes, on which they blew in season and out of it, dancing as they blew. In vain did I command them to be silent, telling them that it was written of old that there is a time to play and dance and a time to cease from dancing, for in this alone they would not obey me. Never could I be at peace because of them then or thereafter, and not till now did I learn how great a treasure is solitude.|$|E

5000|$|The {{group has}} toured {{frequently}} since its inception, including appearances at arts festivals such as Coachella, Harmony, Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, and New Orleans Jazz Fest. Additionally, {{the group has}} played sold-out shows in Australia, Japan, Guam, Portugal, Denmark, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and the Dominican Republic. “Without fans, we’d just be playing at the bar,” admits Kyle. “They make it worth our while - when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> people are having that good of a time, the energy goes back and forth.

60|$|July 1st.--Immediately {{after our}} arrival yesterday, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> inquired {{our way to}} the cathedral, which we reached through a good deal of Scotch dirt, and a rabble of Scotch people of all sexes and ages. The women of Scotland have a faculty of looking {{exceedingly}} ugly as they grow old. The cathedral I have already noticed in the record of my former visit to Scotland. I did it no justice then, nor shall do it any better justice now; but it is a fine old church, although it makes a colder and severer impression than most of the Gothic architecture which I have elsewhere seen. I do not know why this should be so; for portions of it are wonderfully rich, and everywhere there are arches opening beyond arches, and clustered pillars and groined roofs, and vistas, lengthening along the aisles. The person who shows it is an elderly man of jolly aspect and demeanor; he is enthusiastic about the edifice, and makes it the thought and object of his life; and being such a merry sort of man, always saying something mirthfully, and yet, in all his thoughts, words, and actions, having reference to this solemn cathedral, he has the effect of one of the corbels or gargoyles,--those ludicrous, strange sculptures which the Gothic architects appended to their arches.|$|E

But the {{children}} {{understood that it}} took three weeks for an egg to hatch, and anyway the pullet was so intermittent in her attentions to the Easter egg, only sitting on it at night, or when held down by hand in the day, that {{there was plenty of}} time. One evening when I came out from Boston, I was met by a doleful deputation at the front gate, with the news that when the coop was visited that morning after breakfast--they visited the coop every morning before they went to school--the pullet was found perched on a cross-bar in a high state of nerves, and the shell of the Easter egg broken and entirely eaten out. Probably a rat had got in and done it, or, more hopefully, a mink, such as used to attack eggs in the town where I was a boy. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> viewed the wreck, as a first step towards a better situation; and suddenly a thought struck me. 'Children,' I said, 'what did you really expect that egg to hatch, anyway?' They looked askance at one another, and at last the boy said: 'Well, you know, papa, an egg that's been cooked--' And then we all laughed together, and I knew they had been making believe as much as I had, and no more expected the impossible of a boiled egg than I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|We were to {{be married}} after the service which Mr. Carson held every Sunday morning in the large marble hut set apart for that purpose. The service began at ten o'clock, but long before that hour all the natives on the place came up in troops, singing as they came, to be present at the wedding of the [...] "Star." [...] It was a pretty sight to see them, the men dressed in all their finery, and {{carrying}} shields and sticks in their hands, and {{the women and children}} bearing green branches of trees, ferns, and flowers. At length, about half-past nine, Stella rose, pressed my hand, and left me to my reflections. A few minutes to ten she reappeared again with her father, dressed in a white veil, a wreath of orange flowers on her dark curling hair, a bouquet of orange flowers in her hand. To me she seemed like a dream of loveliness. With her came little Tota in a high state of glee and excitement. She was Stella's only bridesmaid. Then we all passed out towards the church hut. The bare space in front of it was filled with hundreds of natives, who set up a song as we came. But we went on into the hut, which was crowded with such of the natives as usually worshipped there. Here Mr. Carson, as usual, read the service, though he was obliged to sit down in order to do so. When it was done--and to me it seemed interminable--Mr. Carson whispered that he meant to marry us outside the hut in sight of all the people. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took our stand under the shade of a large tree that grew near the hut facing the bare space where the natives were gathered.|$|E
