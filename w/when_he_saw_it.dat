25|$|Douglass {{thought of}} joining a white Methodist Church {{but from the}} {{beginning}} he was disappointed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> was segregated. Later he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, an independent black denomination first established in New York City, which counted among its members Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman. He became a licensed preacher in 1839, and this helped him hone his oratorical skills. He held various positions, including steward, Sunday School superintendent, and sexton. In 1840, Douglass delivered a speech in Elmira, New York, then a station on the Underground Railroad. (Years later a black congregation formed there and by 1940 it became the region's largest church).|$|E
500|$|Some artists {{made their}} own {{versions}} and remixes of the song. The American group Boyce Avenue covered [...] "Grenade" [...] and included it in their sixth EP, [...] Acoustic Sessions, Vol. 1, released on December 6, 2010. Gavin Mikhail included {{his version of the}} song and it's instrumental in his album, Grenade. On November 15, 2011, a cover by Trackstarz charted at number 56 on the UK Singles Chart. American rapper Lil Wayne published the first official remix of the song on February 12, 2011. The remix is identical to the song, except for the 16-bar introduction verse that Wayne provides. Mars was so surprised with the remix <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> online, he recalls [...] "I was like, ‘What? Press play". He called it, [...] "Awesome". MTV critique, Jayson Rodriguez, described it as [...] "Lil Wayne delivering a spoken word-style flow, expressing devotion for his love interest". RichGirl, a R girl group, created a remix to the song, released on their Fall in Love with RichGirl mixtape.|$|E
500|$|Ambivalent {{about his}} {{presence}} there, McCain {{chose not to}} conform to the Academy's rules and some of its traditions. Each year he was given over a hundred demerits – earning him membership in the [...] "Century Club" [...] – for offenses such as shoes not being shined, formation faults, room in disorder, and talking out of place. [...] His father came to the Academy to reprimand him on his behavior a number of times. [...] He hated [...] "plebe year", the trial by ordeal and hazing of entering midshipmen that would eventually weed out one quarter of the class. He did not take well to those of higher rank arbitrarily wielding power over him – [...] "It was bullshit, and I resented the hell out of it" [...] – and occasionally intervened <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> being done to others. [...] At 5-foot 7inches and 127pounds (1.70m and 58kg), he competed as a lightweight boxer for three years, where he lacked skills but was fearless and [...] "didn't have a reverse gear".

500|$|Itaru Hinoue, who had {{previously}} worked at VisualArt's once before, introduced Key's founding members {{to the president of}} VisualArt's, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to VisualArt's where they formed Key on July 21, 1998. With the production of Key's debut title Kanon still in its early stages, a brand name had still not been decided on by the developers. The tentative brand name was [...] at first, but Jun Maeda was not pleased with this and wanted a name that would capture the image of the brand. Maeda came upon the name Key <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> on a sign for a musical instrument store he would always pass on his way to work and instantly liked the name. The name Key for the studio was ultimately decided by majority rule. Key released Kanon on June 4, 1999 as an adult game, though the scenes containing adult content were kept to a minimum. This gave the player more of a focus on the characters' stories and on the visuals and music, especially for a visual novel {{at the time of its}} release. A year later, on September 8, 2000, Key released their second game Air, which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to Kanon.|$|E
500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the store stock such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later somebody will be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for his wife, said that he was not sure what to buy, but that he would know it <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate whipped cream, and in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E
500|$|Understanding {{that the}} gates were too narrow for his army to exit {{in an orderly}} fashion, Pyrrhus ordered Helenus to tear down part of the wall and to be {{prepared}} to fend off any enemy counter-attacks against the retreating troops. However, the instructions brought by the messenger were unclear and instead of organising the retreat, Helenus advanced {{with the rest of the}} army into Argos. With the majority of his troops streaming in through the gates, Pyrrhus' line of retreat was blocked off. The disorder was exacerbated when Pyrrhus' largest elephant fell and blocked the gateway and another elephant started running amok after his mahout was felled. [...] The weight of the enemy's assault pushed Pyrrhus and his troops from the agora and compelled them to fight in the narrow street leading to the Diamperes Gate. In the fighting which ensued, Pyrrhus was wounded by a spear wielded by an Argive. As Pyrrhus turned to strike down his assailant, he was hit on the head by a roof tile thrown by his attacker's mother. Pyrrhus was either killed by the force of the tile's impact or, alternately, having fallen dazed from his horse he was decapitated by one of Antigonus' Macedonian soldiers, Zopyrus. Pyrrhus' head was brought by Halcyoneus to Antigonus, who expressed dismay <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> and upbraided his son for acting in such a barbarous manner. Upon Pyrrhus' death, Epiriote resistance crumbled and Antigonus accepted the surrender of Helenus, giving him Pyrrhus' body for burial.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most memorable}} role of Ford's career came {{with his first}} postwar film in 1946, {{starring}} alongside Rita Hayworth in Gilda. This was Glenn Ford's second pairing with Hayworth; his first was in [...] The Lady In Question (1940), a well-received courtroom drama in which Glenn plays [...] a boy {{who falls in love}} with Rita Hayworth when his father, Brian Aherne, tries to rehabilitate her in their bicycle shop. Directed by Hungarian emigre Charles Vidor, the two rising young stars instantly bonded.

2500|$|The film {{became a}} {{favorite}} of the filmmakers of the French New Wave whose films contain many allusions to Vigo's work. The French director François Truffaut {{fell in love with it}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> at age 14 in 1946: [...] "When I entered the theater, I didn't even know who Jean Vigo was. I was immediately overwhelmed with wild enthusiasm for his work." [...] Yugoslavian film director Emir Kusturica has said he is a big admirer of Vigo's work and describes Vigo as a poet. This admiration is best shown in Kusturica's Underground where the underwater scenes are very reminiscent of those from L'Atalante. Other films to pay tribute to L'Atalante include Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris, Leos Carax's Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, and Jean-Luc Godard's In Praise of Love.|$|E

2500|$|Although it was {{a triumph}} of civil engineering, the Thames Tunnel was not a {{financial}} success. It had cost £454,000 to dig and another £180,000 to fit out [...] far exceeding its initial cost estimates. Proposals to extend the entrance to accommodate wheeled vehicles failed owing to cost, and it was used only by pedestrians. It became a major tourist attraction, attracting about two million people a year, each paying a penny to pass through, and {{became the subject of}} popular songs. The American traveller William Allen Drew commented that [...] "No one goes to London without visiting the Tunnel" [...] and described it as the [...] "eighth wonder of the world". <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> for himself in 1851, he pronounced himself [...] "somewhat disappointed in it" [...] but still left a vivid description of its interior, which was more like an underground marketplace than a transport artery: ...|$|E
2500|$|Audio {{tapes of}} President Richard Nixon, in {{conversation}} with his chief of staff, H. R.
