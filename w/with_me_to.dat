[...] "Everybody Ought to Treat a Stranger Right" [...] paired with [...] "Go <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> That Land" [...] were {{chosen as the}} first single released from the session. However, the Great Depression had wiped out much of Johnson's audience, and consequently only 800 copies were pressed. Some of his songs were re-released by Vocalion Records in 1932, but Johnson never recorded again.|$|E

500|$|The title Les Bienveillantes (The Kindly Ones) {{refers to}} the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies The Oresteia written by Aeschylus. The Erinyes or Furies were vengeful goddesses who tracked and tormented those who murdered a parent. In the plays, Orestes, who has killed his mother Clytemnestra to avenge his father Agamemnon, was pursued by these female goddesses. The goddess Athena intervenes, setting up a jury trial to judge the Furies' case against Orestes. Athena casts the {{deciding}} vote which acquits Orestes, then pleads with the Furies to accept the trial's verdict and to transform themselves into [...] "most loved of gods, <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> show and share fair mercy, gratitude and grace as fair." [...] The Furies accept and are renamed the Eumenides or Kindly Ones (in French Les Bienveillantes).|$|E
500|$|By now Blenheim {{was under}} assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had {{happened}} on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off. Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – [...] "...it came into my head to beat parley", he later wrote, [...] "which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms." [...] Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, {{it was not until}} 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.|$|E

500|$|... "Acércate" [...] {{was leaked}} onto the Internet {{prior to the}} album's release; a first in Queen's 15-year career. Originally {{entitled}} [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} infringement and included on the album retitled [...] "Acércate". Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E
500|$|Adem Ali of Forté Magazine {{identified}} the song, along with Raja's subsequent releases, as exemplifying the singer's [...] "blend of club-kid neo-pop" [...] combining elements of pop, techno, and electro music. Raja {{said that his}} music was inspired by electro house and disco. [...] "Diamond Crowned Queen" [...] was called a [...] "grungy dance mix" [...] by WEHOVille's Whitney Friedlander. The instrumental is provided by [...] "deep, throbbing beats" [...] and electronics. Rolling Stone's Lyndsey Parker described Raja's vocal performance as a [...] "whole lot of groaning", and Bustle's Anneliese Cooper classified it {{as an example of}} [...] "crazy shit shouted to a beat". In the chorus, Raja sings [...] "Follow me, follow me, I’m a diamond crowned queen. Come <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> my pretty, pretty palace, Gonna lick on your trigger, every inch will make you quiver." [...] Other lyrics include other sexual references, such as: [...] "S-E-X, sex for dinner / I'm a thunder-breathing dragon cat." ...|$|E
500|$|Skye has {{a strong}} folk music tradition, {{although}} in recent years dance and rock music have been growing in popularity on the island. Gaelic folk rock band Runrig started in Skye and former singer Donnie Munro still works on the island. Runrig's second single and a concert staple is entitled Skye, the lyrics being partly in English and partly in Gaelic and they have released other songs such as [...] "Nightfall on Marsco" [...] that were inspired by the island. Celtic fusion band the Peatbog Faeries are based on Skye. Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson owned an estate at Strathaird on Skye at one time. Several Tull songs are written about Skye, including Dun Ringil, Broadford Bazaar, and Acres Wild (which contains the lines [...] "Come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Winged Isle, / Northern father's western child..." [...] {{in reference to the}} island itself). The Isle of Skye Music Festival featured sets from The Fun Lovin' Criminals and Sparks, but collapsed in 2007.

500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E
500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... I learned how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E
500|$|The lead single, [...] "La Vida es Así", was {{released}} on May 11; the music video (directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on May 17 in Miami and premiered on mun2 on June 22 and VEVO on June 28. Queen said that the genre of bachata is meaningful, since it reveals more feelings. The a cappella version of [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] was sent to Tainy and Keko Musik for production, allowing Queen to pick the version she preferred. The Keko Musik version was later released as a pre-order bonus track for Drama Queen on iTunes. The second single, [...] "Amor Puro" [...] {{was released}} for Puerto Rican radio on September 24. The music video (also directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on September 28, and premiered on VEVO November 30. The video was also filmed in Miami, at the Spanish monastery of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (a historic building dating to 1133 in Sacramenia, Segovia, Spain, later reconstructed in Miami). [...] "Acércate" [...] was leaked online before the album was released, the first time Queen experienced copyright infringement in her 15-year career. Originally titled [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} copyright violation and retitled [...] "Acércate".

500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management.

[...] According to Moore, Shenmue sold [...] "extremely well", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base.
