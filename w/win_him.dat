5|$|Bailey left Charlton {{to replace}} Alan Mullery as Brighton & Hove Albion manager, and the Charlton board {{ironically}} decided to name Mullery as Bailey's successor. Charlton finished the 1981–82 season in 13th place, and Walsh scored 15 goals in total. He performed well against divisional champions Luton Town, giving captain Mal Donaghy a difficult afternoon, which {{was enough to}} <b>win</b> <b>him</b> a move to his next club.|$|E
5|$|After {{events in}} Munich, Jennings {{continued}} {{to report on}} Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat that would <b>win</b> <b>him</b> his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent. That summer, Jennings married {{for the second time}} to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer. His first wife was childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.|$|E
5|$|Back at the {{department}} office, reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker) interviews Andy for a newspaper article. After he brags about the capture, the reporter suggests his heroics might <b>win</b> <b>him</b> back the affections of Ann (Rashida Jones), his ex-girlfriend, much to Andy's excitement. April (Aubrey Plaza), who has romantic feelings for Andy, overhears this and leaves jealously. Evelyn demands delivery of Fairway Frank. Leslie responds that there is uncertainty about the identity of Fairway Frank. She refuses {{to hand over the}} captured opossum and creates a ketchup-blood diversion so that April can escape with the caged animal.|$|E

5|$|Scandal, {{released}} by Shochiku in April 1950, {{was inspired by}} the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese yellow journalism. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. However, it would be Kurosawa's second film of 1950, Rashomon, that would ultimately <b>win</b> <b>him,</b> and Japanese cinema, a whole new international audience.|$|E
5|$|The team {{got their}} first win of the season, in their first stage race, at the Étoile de Bessèges. Dumoulin made a late {{selection}} in stage 3, joining nine other riders who finished {{just ahead of the}} rest of the peloton, and won the sprint to the finish line. Later in February, Moncoutié won the queen stage of the Tour Méditerranéen, finishing at Mont Faron. He had previously won stages there in 2003 and 2009, but his win this year was enough to <b>win</b> <b>him</b> the race overall thanks to his time gap. The squad also won the teams classification. Dumoulin took another win later in February, in the first stage of the two-day Tour du Haut Var. He stayed latched onto Rinaldo Nocentini's wheel during the stage's final climb, and came around him in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; {{the next month}} she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how). In a last attempt to <b>win</b> <b>him</b> back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to Scandinavia from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not only because she was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region {{during a time of}} war, but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she {{returned to}} England and realized that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. She went out on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and then jumped into the River Thames, where a stranger rescued her.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, Ureltu was {{transferred}} to work at Federation of Literary in Hulunbuir League, later successively attended the National Conference on Literature of Minority Groups and the Third Literature Congress of Inner Mongolia. In the next year, {{he was sent to}} study at the literature workshop of China Writers Association. In this year he received several awards, for example, Look, That Greenery <b>won</b> <b>him</b> the National Prize for Literature of Minority Groups, Obsecration of a Hunter <b>won</b> <b>him</b> the National Excellent Short Story Award, Dream Forest <b>won</b> <b>him</b> Gold Award for Inner Mongolian Literature, and Hounds <b>won</b> <b>him</b> Grassland Award for Excellent Short Stories. During the next two years he wrote a series of short stories continued, among which the Hart with Seven-Fork Horns and Amber Bonfire <b>won</b> <b>him</b> the National Excellent Short Story Award of 1982 and 1983. In 1985 he became a secretary of the China Writers Association Secretariat. In 1988 he wrote three short stories, Wolker and Bilig, Firing Early in the Morning and Malu, Malu. In the early 1990s, Ureltu published novella Mysterious Forest, then stopped his fiction writing.|$|R

5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to <b>win</b> <b>him</b> early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|In August, Robinson {{was sent}} to Anzac Cove as a naval liaison officer and on his second day there, was badly wounded near the front line, forcing his {{evacuation}} to England, where King George V presented him with his medal at Buckingham Palace. Returned to the Mediterranean in December 1915 following his recuperation, {{he took over the}} coastal monitor HMS M21, in which he shelled Turkish positions throughout Egypt and Palestine and was awarded another mention in despatches and the Egyptian Order of the Nile, 4th Class. Returning to England in the summer of 1917, he narrowly missed selection for Keyes's operations against Zeebrugge and Ostend owing to his war wounds, and instead trained crews of coastal torpedo boats, a role which led to a distant posting in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Civil War, fighting the Bolshevik forces along the Russian coastline. Robinson commanded a squadron of coastal torpedo boats in the Caspian and forced the surrender of several enemy forts through aggressive tactics. These achievements would later <b>win</b> <b>him</b> the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class. His most notable achievement at this time was leading a small coastal motor boat inside the harbour of Fort Alexandrovsk, where he sank a barge and prompted a mass surrender from the garrison.|$|E
5|$|In Prague, the {{emergence}} of Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre, and had led to a downturn in the Royal Landstheater fortunes. Mahler's task was to help arrest this decline by offering high-quality productions of German opera. He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner, composers with whom he would be particularly associated {{for the rest of}} his career, but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction, and a falling out with his more experienced fellow-conductor, Ludwig Slansky. During his 12 months in Prague he conducted 68 performances of 14 operas (12 titles were new in his repertory), and he also performed Beethoven's Ninth for the first time in his life. By the end of the season, in July 1886, Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the Neues Stadttheater in Leipzig, where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch almost began at once. This conflict was primarily over how the two should share conducting duties for the theatre's new production of Wagner's Ring cycle. Nikisch's illness, from February to April 1887, meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle (except Götterdämmerung), and scored a resounding public success. This did not, however, <b>win</b> <b>him</b> popularity with the orchestra, who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules.|$|E

5|$|In summer 2007, he {{was offered}} a {{short-term}} deal with League Two side Bradford City following a successful trial, teaming back up with Stuart McCall, who Nix knew from his days at Sheffield United. He made his Bradford debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a League Cup game scoring his first senior goal. His league debut came three days later in the first league game to be played at Shrewsbury Town's new ground the New Meadow. He was offered a longer term deal at City, before becoming a regular first team player. His first league goal was a long-range equaliser as Bradford drew 1–1 with Chesterfield on 8 December 2007 before he added a second in successive games in a 2–1 defeat to Peterborough United. His goals helped to <b>win</b> <b>him</b> a contract extension in January {{until the end of}} the 2007–08 season. Later that month he improved his run of goals by scoring in three successive matches to help Bradford to five points from three games within the space of eight days. Nix stayed in the team for the remainder of the season, but it was not until April that he scored again, with a long-range volley against Brentford, as he bid for a new contract for the 2008–09 season. On 29 April 2008, Nix was offered a new deal, which he signed the following week to remain at Bradford for another season.|$|E
5|$|The injured all-rounder missed two matches {{to recuperate}} before reappearing in mid-May, hitting 120 as the Australians posted {{a total of}} 721 against Essex {{in a single day}} at Southend, still the highest single day's total in {{first-class}} cricket. He put on 166 in 65 minutes with Ron Saggers, who, with Bill Brown and Donald Bradman, also scored centuries. Loxton's rapid innings was noted for its hooking and driving and took around 80 minutes. He followed up with an unbeaten 79 and two wickets in the match against Oxford University, but that failed to <b>win</b> <b>him</b> a place in the first set-piece battle of the summer, against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full-strength Test outfit, while Australia fielded their strongest XI, so the fixture was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Bradman opted to play Brown out of the position in the middle-order, and Loxton missed out; Australia went on to win by an innings.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to <b>win</b> <b>him</b> as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E

25|$|Rejecting the {{contract}} was a dangerous tactic and could have broken the union {{if not for the}} support of Vice President Richard Nixon.
