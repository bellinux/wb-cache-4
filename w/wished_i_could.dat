500|$|In another {{review of}} the first book, Publishers Weekly noted that Smith [...] "create a fantasy world fit for the most discriminating medieval partisan. It cleverly walks just this side of parody, getting away with lines like, 'I <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{personally}} flout him and his busy searchers, and make him look the fool he was.'" [...] In a similar vein, Kirkus Reviews praised the first novel as [...] "Smith's lush descriptions evoke a fantastic yet credible world, where magic spells and enchanted stones are everyday facts of life." [...] M. Jean Greenlaw, contributing to The ALAN Review, lauded Smith for her [...] "language and imagery" [...] as well as [...] "her deft plotting [...] keep the reader glued to the pages." [...] Writing for the School Library Journal, Patricia Lothrop-Green, however, gave a largely negative review to the first part, highlighting [...] "huge logical leaps," [...] an [...] "utterly predictable plot," [...] and a heroine whom [...] "many readers will be thoroughly tired of" [...] {{by the end of}} the story.|$|E

He also emphasised that although he took no pleasure from the actual act of killing, he had [...] "worshiped the art and the act of death".|$|E

2500|$|Unlike many umpires, Evans {{never made}} claims to infallibility. [...] "I missed {{a lot of}} {{decision}}s", he once said. [...] "At the time of making such a decision {{there was no doubt}} in my mind as to its correctness. However, a second or two later I felt that I erred and <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> change my original ruling". Evans' humility and impartiality did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sports writers Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, [...] "roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands". On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious. The New York Times described the incident as [...] "one of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed on a ball field".|$|E
