50|$|Salvia chamaedryoides, or germander sage, is an {{evergreen}} perennial {{native to}} the high desert (2100-2800 m elevation) of the Sierra Madre Oriental range in Mexico. Its name comes from sharing the running rootstock typical of Teucrium chamaedrys (<b>wall</b> <b>germander).</b> Spreading freely, it reaches a height of 60 cm when in bloom, with small grey evergreen foliage. The flowers are blue, appearing sporadically throughout the growing season, with peaks of bloom in early summer and autumn. It has been grown in European horticulture since the early 19th century, but was only introduced to the U.S. in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Labdane and clerodane bicyclic diterpenes are an {{important}} group of plants secondary metabolites. Compounds of this group with a furan nucleus have a toxic potential. Studies on <b>Wall</b> <b>germander</b> (Teucrium chamaedrys L.) have shown that hepatotoxicity of this plant is related to a furano-clerodane diterpene: teucrin A. The mechanism of toxicity involves the furan nucleus and is induced by the metabolism {{of this type of}} compounds by the P 450 3 A cytochromes. This type of potential toxic molecules are part of many Lamiaceae, the experimental study performed presents their extraction, detection and identification into Teucrium scorodonia L. and Ballota nigra var. foetida Hayek. mother tinctures.

40|$|Hyperlipidemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors contributing to the cardiovascular diseases. There are various chemical drugs for regulating the lipid profile level. According to the side effects proved for the chemical drugs, we, in the current research paper, investigate the effect of <b>wall</b> <b>germander</b> (Teucrium polium) hydroalcoholic extract effect on the lipid profile in the hypercholesterolemic rats. Wistar male rats, ranging in weight from 150 g to 180 g, were assigned to four groups (n= 5) : control group (ordinary diet), sham group (high, 2 %, cholesterol dietary regime), experimental group one (high, 2 %, cholesterol dietary regime plus 0. 85 mg/ml Teucrium polium hydroalcoholic extract) and experimental group two (high, 2 %, cholesterol dietary regime plus 1. 7 mg/ml Teucrium polium hydroalcoholic extract). The treatment was run in an eight-week period with the termination of which blood samples were collected from the animals. To determine the lipid profile, commercial diagnostic kits were applied. The results were analyzed by the use of SPSS software, ver. 16. From the week six on, the weights of the rats from the experimental group two (high, 2 %, cholesterol diet plus 1. 7 mg/ml Teucrium polium hydroalcoholic extract) showed a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) even in comparison to the control group (ordinary diet). The serum level of triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL-c was found significantly decreased in the experimental group two (P< 0. 001) as compared to Sham group but it did not any significant change in contrast to the control group. In experimental group one (high, 2 %, cholesterol dietary regime plus 0. 85 mg/ml Teucrium polium hydroalcoholic extract), only the cholesterol and TG serum levels were found significantly decreased in respect to the sham group (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively). Regarding the lipoprotein amount, a significant increase was documented in the experimental group two, featuring high density cholesterol (HDL-c), in contrast to the sham group (P< 0. 001). The present study’s findings indicated that an appropriate dosage of T. Polium can cause the regulation of lipid profile as well as the weights of the hypercholesterolemic rats. According to the side effects of the chemical drugs similar in their functions to the effect of T. polium, it can be suggested as an antihyperlipidemic drug.
