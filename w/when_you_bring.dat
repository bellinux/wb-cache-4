5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} features {{introduced to}} the game received a mixed response. IGN noted that the Special Games varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that [...] "they certainly don't make or break the experience." [...] The game's [...] "Power Shots" [...] was also met with an ambivalent reaction—the shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot's Ryan Davis commented that [...] "it {{would have been nice}} if you could just skip past the animations and keep the wild moves." [...] In general, the game's multiplayer modes were more popular than single-player, with the [...] "predictable and basic" [...] artificial intelligence contributing to a low difficulty level at times. GameSpy noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that [...] "The game is very good on its own, but it excels <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> friends into the mix." [...] The mechanics of the tennis gameplay were also popular, with reviewers lauding the game's accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball.|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> come, <b>bring</b> also my paint-box--I forgot it. I {{am going}} to try the {{travellers}} and jennies, and have made a sketch of them and begun the drawing. After that I'll do the staging.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! {{for twenty}} pounds! Seven {{thousands}} of pounds per annum; {{and you give}} me twenty pounds! Fie, Captain Clavering. It is only just for me to speak to you--this! That is all. Come; <b>when</b> will <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> me fifty?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And I {{will write}} <b>thee</b> word <b>when</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>bring</b> my sister back to me. Here come the horses. Have you bid adieu to the Countess and Lady Fanny? They are kissing {{their hands to}} you from the music-room balcony." ...|$|R

5000|$|Impressions Games {{general manager}} David Lester commented during development, [...] "We wanted {{the game to}} be more {{multiplayer}} friendly, and {{one way to do}} that was by adding realtime combat. Besides, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can <b>bring</b> a castle down by aiming a battering ram or a catapult at it in realtime, it's a lot more satisfying." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mar. This is palpable, this is manifest; I shall {{remember}} you, lady fruiterer; I {{shall have}} your baskets searched <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> oranges again.--Come away, nieces; and thanks, honest fellow, for thy discovery. [...] [Exeunt MARIO and Women.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] said McGinty, shaking {{him by the}} hand. [...] "I {{leave it}} with you. It {{will be a great}} day <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> us the news. It's just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{driven to}} the last ditch, Anne, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> up Miss Cornelia as a reinforcement. She will say, 'Just like a man,' and rage furiously. No matter. This is no affair for Miss Cornelia to settle. Leslie alone must decide it." ...|$|E

[Aside.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Amory did not {{of course}} in the least {{understand}} what Major Pendennis meant.--Perhaps she thought over circumstances in her mind and asked herself, could he be a negotiator for a former suitor of hers, and could he mean Pen? No, it was impossible--He had been civil, but nothing more.--So she said laughing, [...] "Who is the clever man, and <b>when</b> will <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> him to me, Major Pendennis? I am dying to see him." ...|$|R
25|$|I have shewed unto you the greatnesse of your sinne, and folly in particular, {{in making}} this Antipologia, {{as well as your}} former booke: They were both unseasonable, disordered, sinfull and {{ungrounded}} vapours; scandalizing the Churches of Christ: There are many untruths in them both, & that not onely where you make naked relations of Tales, but where you make profession before God, and the World, to bring sufficient reasons; <b>when</b> indeede <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> nothing but shadowes and fig-leaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "How funny it will be," [...] said Effie, [...] "to see Mrs. Chung's tiny feet <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> her to London. I suppose one {{of these}} days, on one of your flying visits to Pekin, you will take to {{yourself}} a wife in your country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{not much}} fear she'll look black on the wife, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> the money home with her. But where'll you live, Martin? The little shop at Dunmore'll be {{no place for}} Mrs Kelly, when there's a lady of the name with £400 a-year of her own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a hotel here, {{but they}} couldn't take you in," [...] said the man. [...] "Party of timber-right prospectors came along, and they're kind of frolicsome. They might {{find you a}} berth on the verandah, but I don't know that it would suit the lady. It mixes things up {{considerable}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|Seeing my surprise, he went on, [...] "I {{drove down}} in a gig that {{afternoon}} to look after that boy. You might have heard my wheels <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came out to look after him yourself, for I was aware {{of you and your}} little maid going up when I was walking the horse down. Making an inquiry or two about him in the town, I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him <b>when</b> I observed <b>you</b> <b>bringing</b> him home here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said George, as he alighted {{from the}} wagon, [...] "so far as being {{hidden from view}} goes, {{this is a good}} place; but I fancy it will be quite a {{different}} matter <b>when</b> <b>you</b> try to <b>bring</b> a load of glycerine here. It would be a job that I should hesitate to undertake." ...|$|R
5000|$|That Thing Called Tadhana strips romance {{down to its}} core. Our {{movies have}} become needlessly complicated. They are stories about people from {{different}} worlds, overcoming incredible odds to end up kissing {{each other in the}} end. This movie, on the other hand, is just about two people spending time with each other, slowly falling in love. It is about just needing someone to be there <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can’t <b>bring</b> yourself to finish the song you’re singing at karaoke. It’s about the simple, beautiful feeling of having somebody to keep the song going.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Parbleu! class not {{my niece}} with those sordid beings, man,' said the Chevalier, angrily. 'Here is your price'--tossing a heavy purse on the table--'and as much more shall await you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> me sure {{intelligence}} {{where to find}} my niece. You understand; and mark, not one word of the gentleman you saw here. You say she believes him dead?' ...|$|E
60|$|Pitt.—A strong {{denunciation}} of Pitt for the French war. People don’t realise what the French war meant. In 1812 wheat at Liverpool was 20s. (?) the imperial bushel of 65 pounds (?)! Think of that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> it into {{figures of the}} cost of a loaf. And that was the time when Eaton, Eastnor, and other great palaces were built by the landlords out of the high rents which the war and war prices enabled them to exact.|$|E
6000|$|... "My cousin seldom comes over, herself," [...] {{the latter}} said. [...] "I know, right well, {{that it is}} from no {{slackness}} of her own, but that her husband likes not her intimacy here. It is well, then, that you should go over and see them, for it is only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> her that I see Ciceley. I would she were your sister, lad, for she is a bright little maid, and would make the old house lively." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "'Mr. Sandman' didn't bring any dreams or cute things to Portland. This is Grimm, after all. Why <b>bring</b> dreams <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can <b>bring</b> death and blindness? The {{case of the}} week proved {{to be one of}} the greater {{investigations}} of Grimm Season 2. The idea of a man stealing the sight of people who are in periods of grief and, literally, having them lose their way all so he can find his own is pretty compelling." ...|$|R
6000|$|Paddy {{sat down}} and laughed until his sides ached. [...] "Come make me another call someday, Sammy!" [...] he said. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do, please <b>bring</b> some real news.

6000|$|It was {{a strange}} Treasury, but no other could have suited the Palace. The Englishman watched, open-mouthed, blaming himself {{because he could not}} catch the meaning of the orders given to the flying chaprassies, nor make {{anything}} of the hum in the verandah and the tumult on the stairs. The old man took the commonplace currency note and announced his willingness to give change in silver. [...] "We have no small notes here," [...] he said. [...] "They are not wanted. In a little while, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> next <b>bring</b> the Honour of your Presence this way, you shall find the silver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be careful <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> up ashore. Let the men row very gently, {{after they}} once get away, {{so as not}} to attract any attention. Let them take cutlasses, but no pistols. If a shot were fired the {{batteries}} would be sure, at once, there was some mischief going on. A little shouting won't matter so much; it might be merely a quarrel. Of course, the instant you are on board you will cut the cables, and get up sail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps one thing, {{and perhaps}} another. He's good and kind, but he hasn't got much head for {{these sort of}} things, he's always {{thinking}} of something else. Just look what a fool Squire George (may he twist and turn in his grave) made of him. You ask him, if you like; but you be guided by yourself, dearie. Your head is worth six Reverend Fraser's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> it to a thing. But I must be off, and count the linen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lilybell is safe, {{but she is}} in a magic sleep, {{and will}} not wake till you bring us a golden wand from the earth elves, a cloak of {{sunshine}} from the air spirits, and a crown of diamonds from the water fairies. It is a hard task, for you have no friends to help you along. But if you love Lilybell enough to be patient, brave, and kind, you may succeed, and she will wake to reward you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> the fairy gifts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Baron Von Ragastein," [...] he said, [...] "there are six {{of those}} maps in existence. That {{one is for}} you. Lock it away and guard it {{as though it were}} your {{greatest}} treasure on earth, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are alone, <b>bring</b> it out and study it.

60|$|CHARTERIS. I now {{assert the}} right I reserved--the right of {{breaking}} with <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I please. Advanced views, Julia, involve advanced duties: you cannot be an advanced woman <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>bring</b> {{a man to}} your feet, and a conventional woman <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want to hold him there against his will. Advanced people form charming friendships: conventional people marry. Marriage suits {{a good deal of}} people; and its first duty is fidelity. Friendship suits some people; and its first duty is unhesitating, uncomplaining acceptance of a notice of a change of feeling from either side. You chose friendship instead of marriage. Now do your duty, and accept your notice.|$|R
