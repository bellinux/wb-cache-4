5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E

25|$|William Bouguereau {{chooses to}} portray the {{characters}} of Cupid and Psyche as young children, almost babies. Cupid, the Roman interpretation of Eros, is often portrayed as a fantastic, mischievous winged baby with a bow and arrow. Eros, the Greek equivalent, is often depicted as a young man, which is when the love affair between him and Psyche plays out. Instead, we see Cupid as a baby, Psyche is also portrayed as a young child, though typically through art history she {{is seen as a}} young woman. Bouguereau chooses to paint her with butterfly wings, for psyche was the Greek word given to butterflies by Aristotle. Psyche is a symbol to the transformation of the human soul, as she transforms from human to immortal. The decision to paint the characters as children is a reference to their innocence, before the corruption of their affair by Venus. This depiction would have been widely accepted in the Salon it was shown at. Bouguereau applied this story in multiple paintings of his, depicting them as the young lovers <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> familiar with.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the core}} of Unger's {{philosophy}} are two key conceptions: first the infinity of the individual, and secondly the singularity {{of the world and}} the reality of time.

In Unger's terms, we are both [...] "context-bound and context-transcending; [...] "we appear as [...] "the embodied spirit;" [...] as [...] "the infinite imprisoned within the finite." [...] For Unger, there is no natural state of the individual and his social being. Rather, we are infinite in spirit and unbound in what we can become. As such, no social institution or convention can contain us. While institutions do exist and shape our beings and our interactions, we can change both their structure and the extent to which they imprison us.|$|E

2500|$|That is, {{to combine}} n data points with total {{precision}} of nτ (or equivalently, total variance of n/σ2) and mean of values , derive a new total precision simply {{by adding the}} total precision of the data to the prior total precision, and form a new mean through a precision-weighted average, i.e. a weighted average of the data mean and the prior mean, each weighted by the associated total precision. This makes logical sense if the precision is thought of as indicating the certainty of the observations: In {{the distribution of the}} posterior mean, each of the input components is weighted by its certainty, and the certainty of this distribution is the sum of the individual certainties. (For the intuition of this, compare the expression [...] "the whole is (or is not) greater {{than the sum of its}} parts". [...] In addition, consider that the knowledge of the posterior comes from a combination of the knowledge of the prior and likelihood, so it makes sense that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> certain of it than of either of its components.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In this example, the Kalman filter can {{be thought}} of as {{operating}} in two distinct phases: predict and update. In the prediction phase, the truck's old position will be modified according to the physical laws of motion (the dynamic or [...] "state transition" [...] model). Not only will a new position estimate be calculated, but a new covariance will be calculated as well. Perhaps the covariance is proportional to the speed of the truck because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> uncertain about the accuracy of the dead reckoning position estimate at high speeds but very certain about the position estimate when moving slowly. Next, in the update phase, a measurement of the truck's position is taken from the GPS unit. Along with this measurement comes some amount of uncertainty, and its covariance relative to that of the prediction from the previous phase determines how much the new measurement will affect the updated prediction. Ideally, as the dead reckoning estimates tend to drift away from the real position, the GPS measurement should pull the position estimate back towards the real position but not disturb it to the point of becoming rapidly jumping and noisy.|$|E
2500|$|Three parties {{participated in}} the {{referendum}} campaign: Smallwood's Confederate Association campaigned for the confederation option while in the anti-confederation campaign Peter Cashin's Responsible Government League and Chesley Crosbie's Economic Union Party (both of which called for a vote for responsible government) took part. No party advocated petitioning Britain to continue the Commission of Government. [...] Canada had issued an invitation to join it on generous financial terms. Smallwood was the leading proponent of confederation with Canada, insisting, [...] "Today <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> disposed to feel that our very manhood, our very creation by God, entitles us to standards of life no lower than our brothers on the mainland." [...] Displaying courage and persistence, he succeeded in having the Canada option on the referendum. His main opponents were Cashin and Crosbie. Cashin, a former finance minister, led the Responsible Government League, warning against cheap Canadian imports and the high Canadian income tax. Crosbie, {{a leader of the}} fishing industry, led the Party for Economic Union with the United States, seeking responsible government first, to be followed by closer ties with the United States, which could be a major source of capital.|$|E
