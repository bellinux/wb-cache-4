40|$|In this research, it {{is shown}} that {{critical}} layers can {{exist in a}} <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> only in presence of a shear flow and different orientations of a uniform magnetic fluid. The methodology followed extends the case of cold plasma to <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> with {{the inclusion of a}} new term. In the case of critical layer behaviour in a <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> the waves incident on the critical layer emerge from it being heavily attenuated or escalated by an exponential factor. Ion‐cyclotron waves effect have been considered and its effects on the cyclotron behaviour are obtained. A major result obtained is that a dimensionless number which usually characterizes critical layers is modified to suit the <b>warm</b> <b>plasma,</b> with the conditions laid on it. The objective of the research is to investigate the effect on heating the plasma with the relevance to fusion problems...|$|E

40|$|In {{modeling}} electron cyclotron (EC) waves {{for heating}} (ECH) and current drive (ECCD) applications, the standard approach describes wave propagation using geometric optic ray tracing with cold plasma dispersion and wave absorption using a relativistic <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> expression.

We {{show that this}} interpretation can be achieved through an improved first-principles method. Our calculation shows that the shift of K-edges exhibits selective sensitivity to thermal parameters and thus would be a suitable temperature index to <b>warm</b> dense <b>plasmas.</b> We also show with a simple model that the shift of K-edges {{can be used to}} detect inhomogeneity inside <b>warm</b> dense <b>plasmas</b> when combined with other experimental tools...|$|R

It is found that both the symmetry and the degeneracy of the calculated bands normal for the solid micro-structured targets may be destroyed by the electron-ion core Coulomb interactions. Moreover, the calculated Fermi levels of the micro-structured <b>warm</b> dense <b>plasmas</b> are about 1 eV higher than those of the original carbon nanotubes, while the transition energies of the <b>warm</b> dense <b>plasmas</b> are almost always smaller than those for the original carbon nanotubes...|$|R
40|$|Generalizing {{the work}} of Lenard and Bernstein, we {{introduce}} a new, fully relativistic model to describe collisional plasmas. Like the Fokker–Planck operator, this equation represents velocity diffusion and conserves particle number. However, unlike the Fokker–Planck operator, it is linear in the distribution function, and so more amenable to a fluid treatment. By taking moments, we derive a new fluid model together with a hierarchy of closure schemes, and demonstrate the damping effects of collisions on Langmuir waves in cold and <b>warm</b> <b>plasmas...</b>|$|R

More {{than half of the}} charging events had potentials of - 50 V or more, and potentials on the order of - 1000 V were observed. All of the spacecraft charging events reported in this paper occurred during sunlit conditions.

30|$|Now, we {{consider}} the wave propagation in a cylindrical waveguide filled with collisional, <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> and a relativistic electron beam. We use the hydrodynamic model for the <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> in which the essential equations are the continuity equation, equation of motion and Maxwell’s equations. We take into consideration that the plasma is quasineutral and that the plasma electrons have a finite temperature, whereas the beam electrons are cold but move at a velocity comparable to light velocity.|$|E

It is {{shown that a}} purely electrical treatment of both the models without an explicit use of the boundary condition on electron velocity yields the same results as those previously obtained through an electromechanical treatment. The essential {{difference between the two}} models is that for the electron-reflecting model, fields are nonzero only in the exterior region, while for the electron-transparent model, they are nonzero both in the exterior and interior regions of the antenna.

40|$|Oblique {{propagation}} of magnetohydrodynamic waves in <b>warm</b> <b>plasmas</b> {{is described by}} a modified vector derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation, if charge separation in Poisson's equation and the displacement current in Ampere's law are properly taken into account. This modified equation cannot be reduced to the standard derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation and hence its possible integrability and related properties need to be established afresh. Indeed, the new equation is shown to be integrable by {{the existence of a}} bi-Hamiltonian structure, which yields the recursion operator needed to generate an infinite sequence of conserved densities. Some of these have been found explicitly by symbolic computations based on the symmetry properties of the new equation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with investigation {{of the influence of}} an intense high frequency electric field and relativistic <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> waveguide on elec-trostatic oscillations of nonuniform bounded plasma. The stabilizing effect of a strong high frequency (pump) electrical field on beam–plasma interac-tion in a cylindrical relativistic <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> waveguide is discussed. A new mathematical technique “separation method ” was applied to the two-fluid plasma model to separate the equations, which describe the system, into two parts, time and space parts. Plasma electrons are considered to have a rela-tivistic, thermal velocity. It is shown that a high frequency electric field has no essential influence on dispersion characteristics of unstable surface waves excited in a relativistic <b>warm</b> <b>plasma</b> waveguide by a low-density electron beam. The region of instability is only slightly narrowing and the growth rate decreases by a small parameter and this result was reduced comparing to cold, nonrelativistic plasma. Also, it is found that the plasma electrons did not affect the solution of the space part of the problem. PACS numbers: 52. 27. Ny, 52. 35. –g, 94. 20. wf 1...|$|E

40|$|The electron-neutral {{collision}} {{effects on}} the Compton scattering process are investigated in <b>warm</b> collisional <b>plasmas.</b> The Compton scattering cross section in <b>warm</b> collisional <b>plasmas</b> is obtained by the Salpeter structure factor with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the plasma dielectric function {{as a function of}} the electron-neutral collision frequency, Debye length, and wave number. It is shown that the influence of electron-neutral collision strongly suppresses the Compton scattering cross section in <b>warm</b> collisional <b>plasmas.</b> It is also found that the electron-neutral collision effect on the differential Compton scattering cross section is more significant in forward scattering directions. We show that the differential Compton scattering cross section has a maximum at the scattering angle phi = pi/ 2. In addition, we find that the electron-neutral collision effect on the total Compton scattering cross section increases with increasing Debye length and wave number. The variation of the Compton scattering cross section due to the change of collision frequency and plasma parameters is also discussed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

It is shown how this method may be used in the microscopic description of small-signal wave propagation and in the study of nonlinear wave interactions. The linear theory is developed for an infinite, homogeneous, collisionless, warm magnetoplasma. A summary is presented of a perturbation expansion scheme described by Galloway and Kim (1971), and Lagrangians to third order in perturbation are considered.

Even when the nonthermal particles do not contribute significantly to the dispersion equation, unequal thermal electron and ion number densities (due to the presence of the nonthermal particles) may cause fundamental low wave number modifications to the Alfven modes, including the creation of a new resonance and severely modified dispersion.
