40|$|Objective. While the {{potential}} toxicity of metals in humans is a well-established fi eld of research, {{there are few}} studies that examine circulating concentrations of metals in large population-based samples. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze levels of heavy metals and trace elements in both <b>whole</b> blood <b>and</b> serum in an elderly population, and to examine if gender, kidney function, haemoglobin or serum albumin could impact the distribution of metals between <b>whole</b> blood <b>and</b> serum. Methods. <b>Whole</b> blood <b>and</b> serum samples from 1016 70 -year-olds living in Uppsala, Sweden, were analyzed for aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, chromium, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, and zinc using inductively coupled plasma-sector fi eld mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). Distribution between <b>whole</b> blood <b>and</b> serum was evaluated by the ratio between <b>whole</b> blood <b>and</b> serum concentration (B/S-ratio). Results. Concentrations differed signifi cantly between <b>whole</b> blood <b>and</b> serum measurements for all 11 metals (p 0. 00001). The highest B/S-ratios were found for lead (27), zinc (9), manganese (6), and nickel (4). Copper (0. 86), cobalt (0. 84), and molybdenum (0. 86) showed B/S-ratios 1. Especially the B/S-ratios for chromium, mercury and nickel correlated with kidney function (GFR) (r 0. 21, 0. 21 and 0. 36 respectively, p 0. 0001). Conclusions. The distribution between <b>whole</b> blood <b>and</b> serum varied considerably for different metals.

5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a <b>whole),</b> <b>and</b> yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
