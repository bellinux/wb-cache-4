40|$|A low-density <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboard</b> {{has been}} {{compressed}} along its transversal direction. The experiment {{was carried out}} in ESRF synchrotron (ID 19) and X-ray microtomographic images were recorded for each state. Stipulating that the fibreboard is a discontinuous material essentially made of air, that the compression simply re-organises the spatial distribution of the fibres and does not involve their intrinsic mechanical properties, we are able to deduce the material points density variations along the thickness of the panel. Good agreement is achieved between the macroscopic deformation of the sample and the microscopic compression rate evaluation. Then, the modifications of structural parameters are investigated by 3 D image analysis. The relationship between the local structure and the behaviour of the <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboard</b> are deduced. Finally, a modelling approach allows the local densification to be predicted and confirms the initial hypotheses about the local behaviour of the material. In particular, polyester bonds are not involved. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|The material’s low {{surface to}} volume ratio {{encourages}} self-ignition, as this limits heat losses, facilitating the material’s temperature rise. This ratio is {{inversely proportional to}} a characteristic dimension (radius) of the material; the larger this characteristic dimension, the lower the {{surface to volume ratio}} and higher the propensity to self-heat. The ignition occurs once the size of a material exceeds its critical radius, with smaller values of critical radius indicating increasing risk of self-ignition. For example, at 100 °C, <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> cork and cotton soaked with raw linseed oil possess critical radii of 0.5, 0.55 and 0.017 [*]m (Gross & Robertson 1958), while coal exhibits self-heating only under bulk storage conditions. This supports the previous statement that linseed oil applied onto the cotton induces a greater tendency of the resulting material to self-heat.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>fibreboards</b> {{can serve}} as {{alternative}} sustainable insulation material for external thermal insulation component systems (ETICS). In Germany, the application of ETICS with <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboards</b> is restricted to low buildings. The restrictions are mainly caused by the smouldering tendency of the <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboards.</b> Thus, {{the development of an}} ETICS with <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboards</b> for multi-storey buildings complying with the requirements would provide a new scope of application for this sustainable insulation material. This paper presents first results of standardised and innovative investigation methods as basis for the development. These investigations and analyses concern the fire behaviour, especially smouldering processes, the plaster system, other constructive protection measures as well as risk and safety analyses...|$|R

40|$|Full-scale {{laboratory}} {{measurements were}} taken to determine the moisture convection performance of the joint of an external wall and attic floor. This joint {{is one of the}} most typical air leakage paths, where the highest air pressure difference forms in winter. Two commonly used external walls (timber-frame and autoclaved aerated concrete walls) and two different sheathing materials (<b>wood</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and mineral wool) were studied. The attic floor was in both cases a timber-frame structure. A two-dimensional heat, air, and moisture transport computer model was used to study the hygrothermal behaviour of the joint studied. Results from the laboratory measurement series and computer simulation showed that, in leaky joints of this kind, the moisture convection due to positive air pressure remarkably raised the moisture accumulation rate on the inner surface of sheathing. At same time, the sheathing material played an important role in the hygrothermal behaviour of the joint. Moisture convection at constant pressure difference and humidity load conditions was possible to control with airtightness (exfiltration rate) and sheathing material. The results of this study are used to determine the airtightness requirements of structures for several positive pressure and airtightness levels. 1...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{scarcity of}} resources and raw materials in the wood panels industry, {{it is imperative to}} look for suitable alternatives to the established resources. Therefore a combination of the traditionally used and newly explored sources may reveal highly innovative ways. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide an insight into the behavior of the material and possible new applications of those fiber/particle wood and waste leather composites. For this reason exclusively fibers of spruce were used for the trials. Wet white (WW) leather particles and wet blue (WB) leather particles were mixed with the wooden materials for the production of high density fibreboards. Besides the mechanical properties such as the internal bond (IB) the bending strength (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) was analyzed. Further physical property as thickness swelling after 24 h watering was investigated. To analyze how the density influences the behavior under thermal conditions, fiberboards with the densities 500, 700 and 900 kg/m³ were tested. The results of the material properties were influenced by the leather content of the panels. The results for the UF-bonded HDF boards show enhancement of the transverse IB with increasing wet blue leather content, whereas the other mechanical properties decline meanwhile. The thickness swelling showed higher values compared to the <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboard.</b> The results of this study underline the usefulness of integrating leather shavings to HDF and give an overview of their influence in wood fiber materials. The combination of the natural resource wood fiber and the leather waste products (Wet Blue and Wet White) gives a very interesting new material, its mechanical properties allow a variety of possible application in future applications...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of the properties of wood fibres leather shavings composite board by using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate data analysis. In this study fibreboards were manufactured with different leather amounts by using spruce fibres, as well as vegetable and mineral tanned leather shavings (wet white and wet blue).

The NIR spectra were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method. These results demonstrate the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy to estimate the physical and mechanical properties (e. g., bending strength). This phenomenon provides a possibility for quality assurance systems by using the NIRS...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} research {{undertaken by}} the Scottish Energy Centre at Edinburgh Napier University to refurbish a historic library building by means of thermal improvements. The interventions selected were specifically chosen to minimalise any impact on the architectural integrity of the building. The study involved thermally enhancing the ceiling using a hygroscopic insulation material (200 mm <b>wood</b> <b>fibreboards).</b> The objective was to measure the thermal transmittance and hygrothermal performance of the building, both pre and post intervention, {{with the aim of}} reducing heat loss without causing condensation problems. The research demonstrated that, {{through the use of a}} modern, natural insulation material, the thermal transmittance (U-value) was reduced from 1. 3 to 0. 2 (W/mK) – reducing the buildings energy consumption and associated carbon emissions, but most importantly conserving thermal comfort and preserving the buildings literary content. The hygrothermal analysis showed that the natural, vapour permeable insulating material altered the hygrothermal profile of the attic space. Extended monitoring of this environment detected conditions for one prolonged condensation episode However; visual surveys suggest that the hygroscopic insulation material acted to mitigate any detrimental effects of condensation build-up...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of absorption coefficients of the gases CO, CO 2 and H 2 O at high temperatures {{is important for}} the in situ determination of the concentration of these gases in combustion system. These coefficients can be calculated using molecular data form the HITRAN database. The 1996 edition of this database contains a special high temperature database for CO, CO 2 and H 2 O. Based on these data absorption coefficients and spectra of CO, CO 2 and H 2 O have been calculated for different concentrations and temperatures. Additionally, measurements were carried out using a high temperature calibration gas cell and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy absorption spectroscopy. A comparison between the spectra calculated and measured showed a good agreement. At temperatures of 1100 °C large deviations between these results of theory and experiment could be found for certain spectral regions of CO 2. Based on these results the measuring system was used for the quantitative analysis of the combustion gases in a pilot-scale horizontally moving grate furnace as well as in a laboratory scale furnace using wood chips, waste <b>wood</b> and <b>fibreboard</b> as fuels...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{aldehydes}} {{in a variety of}} environmental situations. Aldehydes generally have a strong odor and are highly irritating to the mucous membranes. Knowledge about odor perception and especially irritation potency in humans is thus essential in risk assessment and regulation, e. g. setting occupational exposure limits. However, data on odor and irritation are lacking or limited for several aldehydes. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the odor and lateralization thresholds of some commonly occurring aldehydes. Acrolein and crotonaldehyde where chosen as they are formed when organic material is heated or burned, e. g. during cigarette smoking. n-Hexanal was also included as it is emitted from <b>wood</b> pellets and <b>fibreboard.</b> To study odor and lateralization thresholds of these aldehydes, a novel, inexpensive olfactometer was designed to enable delivery of reliable and stable test concentrations and thus valid measures of thresholds. The delivery system consists of seven syringe pumps, each connected to a Tedlar bag containing a predefined concentration of the tested aldehyde vapor. To validate the threshold measures, a test-retest was performed with a separate method, namely odor delivery via amber bottles. Twenty healthy naïve individuals were tested. The median odor thresholds of acrolein, crotonaldehyde and hexanal were 17, 0. 8, and 97 ppb, respectively. No lateralization threshold could be identified for acrolein (highest tested concentration was 2 940 ppb in 5 subjects), whereas the medians were 3 and 390 ppb for the latter two. In addition, odor thresholds for n-hexanal were also determined using two methods where similar results were obtained, suggesting that the olfactometer presentation method is valid. We found olfactory detection and lateralization thresholds (except for acrolein) in alliance with, or lower than, previously reported in naïve subjects. The new olfactometer allows better control of presentations timing and vapor concentration...|$|R
