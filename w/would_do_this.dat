This {{made it possible for}} the judiciary to investigate the crimes committed during the Dirty War. During the campaign, Alfonsín had promised that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> while Luder had been non-committal. Alfonsín also ordered the initiation of judicial cases against guerrilla leaders Mario Firmenich, Fernando Vaca Narvaja, Ricardo Obregón Cano, Rodolfo Galimberti, Roberto Perdía, Héctor Pardo and Enrique Gorriarán Merlo; and military leaders Jorge Videla, Emilio Massera, Orlando Agosti, Roberto Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Omar Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Dami Dozo. He also requested the extradition of guerrilla leaders who were living abroad.|$|E

They <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> by filling in the first three tiers (with one, two, and four people) with phony names, ensuring they get the first seven payouts, at eight times the buy-in sum, without paying a single penny themselves. So if the buy-in were $5,000, they would receive $40,000, paid for by the first eight investors. They would continue to buy in underneath the real investors, and promote and prolong the scheme {{for as long as possible}} to allow them to skim even more from it before it collapses.|$|E

25|$|Steinbeck's {{characters}} are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish {{a sense of}} respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established {{as many of the}} ranch hands are victims of the Great Depression. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie {{is the only one who}} is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.|$|E
500|$|Although the khanjar was {{originally}} {{created as a}} weapon to attack and defend, it is utilized solely for ceremonial and practical purposes today. [...] The latter situation would occur in the desert, where it {{is used as a}} tool for hunting and skinning animals, as well as for slicing ropes. [...] Because of this development, it is now considered a [...] "social taboo" [...] in Oman to pull out one's khanjar from its scabbard without blooding it, since the only time men <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> would be to seek vengeance or to defend oneself.|$|E
500|$|Wilson dislikes {{saying his}} character's catchphrase ("I don't believe it!") and only {{performs}} {{the line for}} charity events for a small fee. This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode [...] "The Mainland", where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how [...] "tasteless and wrong" [...] {{it would be to}} lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars, in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as [...] "Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson".|$|E

Thompson <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> and in the process five of the seven horses would die when he got lost.

2500|$|Art {{historian}} Ronald Pickvance {{says that}} with [...] "its arbitrary collage of separate motifs," [...] The Starry Night [...] "is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'." [...] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes {{them with the}} village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination. Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east, as does Jirat-Wasiutyński. Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh [...] "telescoped" [...] the view in certain of {{the pictures of the}} view from his window, and {{it stands to reason that}} Van Gogh <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in a painting featuring the morning star.

2500|$|Petty's only {{statistical}} {{technique is}} the use of simple averages. He would not be a statistician by today's standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data. Because obtaining census data was difficult, if not impossible, especially for Ireland, he applied methods of estimation. The way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of London. He <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> by either estimating it by exports or by deaths. His method of using exports is by considering that a 30 percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population. The way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by 30 – estimating that one out of thirty people die each year. To obtain the population of all of England he would multiply the population of London by 8. Such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and Petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the Crown. (Henry Spiegel) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the past, rubber {{chickens}} {{put up by}} fans {{whenever a}} Giants player (especially Barry Bonds) was intentionally walked, would line the foul portion of the wall. The fans <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> {{to show that the}} opposing team is [...] "chicken" [...] for not pitching right to the Giants players. In recent seasons, as the team's strength has shifted from hitting to pitching, fans will line up [...] "K" [...] signs with each strikeout by a Giants pitcher. To some seniors, the right field area vaguely suggests the layout at the Polo Grounds. This deep corner of the ballpark has been dubbed [...] "Death Valley" [...] and [...] "Triples' Alley." [...] Like its Polo Grounds counterpart, {{it is very difficult to}} hit a home run to this area, and a batted ball that finds its way into this corner often results in a triple. Triples' Alley is also infamous for bad bounces, most notably when Ichiro Suzuki hit the first-ever inside-the-park home run in an All-Star Game by lining the ball off one of the archways and sideways past the outfielders. Nate Schierholtz performed the same feat in the 2009 season as a pinch hitter. Aubrey Huff did it again in the 2010 season, as did Conor Gillaspie in 2011. Ángel Pagán ended a game in May 2013 with a two-run walk-off inside-the-park home run, the first of its kind at AT Park.|$|E

2500|$|When Silas {{suffers a}} heart attack, Lynsey {{is faced with}} a dilemma when he is placed under her care. Hassan {{revealed}} that her character is not [...] "thinking straight" [...] {{and even though it}} is her job to save lives, Lynsey can not decide if she should {{come to the aid of}} the person who attempted to kill her. Lynsey is not sure if Silas is genuinely ill. In March 2011, Hassan revealed that Silas would want revenge on Lynsey after her telling people that he is behind recent murders. Hassan told a reporter from All About Soap that Lynsey innocently buys diet pills for Cheryl off the internet but Silas sees this as an opportunity to seek revenge and switches them with his heart medication, leading to Cheryl collapsing in Chez Chez. Cheryl is found by Lynsey, who is terrified for Cheryl and feels guilty. Lynsey is told that Cheryl has sedatives in her system although she is [...] "completely flummoxed" [...] as to how this happened as she does not consider that Silas would have wanted to hurt Cheryl. Hassan explained that Silas plans to [...] "blacken" [...] Lynsey's name with the scheme. Rawle revealed that Silas would work on [...] "discrediting" [...] Lynsey and would undermine her because she is aware of his secret. He explained that Silas <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> by breaking into her flat and moving things around in the middle of the night, adding that [...] "it's like a war of attrition" [...] with Silas planning to [...] "wear her down and send her mad".|$|E

Grandma Lor spits a betel nut {{she had been}} chewing to show contempt for Walt Kowalski, even though the Hmong do not chew betel nuts. The Hmong shaman reads Walt's personal character, when in real life he would communicate with the spirit world. In the film the shaman himself does a sacrifice of a chicken {{in a manner that}} Schein and Thoj say is [...] "in dramatic ceremonial fashion," [...] when in real life an assistant <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> [...] "perfunctorily." [...] The authors said that the hu plis ceremony done in honor of the baby has an incorrect spatial layout, that the clothing and grooming of the Hmong gangs is not correct, and [...] "the obsequious making of offerings on doorstep" [...] are not accurate. While Thao himself cleans dishes, Schein and Thoj add that he would not do this alone because he is in a house with other female family members. Schein and Thoj also add that there is [...] "inconsistent use of the two Hmong dialects within one family." [...] They also argue that members of a Hmong clan would not show aggression towards a member of a fellow clan and that they would not rape a member of their own clan, like the gang in the film rapes Sue. Sharon Her, a Hmong writer from New York, argued that the film had [...] "confusion of Asian customs" [...] and that [...] "Hmong people do not use favors as a method of atonement nor do they endlessly shower individuals with gifts out of gratitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} adapt Pettibon's artwork {{to meet the}} layout {{requirements}} of their albums and flyers, the members of Black Flag would alter it by cutting and pasting and adding their name, logo, and gig details to it. They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls {{going out on a}} flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of paste onto a telephone pole, stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance. Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free. [...] "To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or whited out, and I'd always ask nicely, 'Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?' Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I'm not venting or complaining, just stating fact." [...] Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used {{on the cover of the}} Loose Nut album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer Bill Stevenson to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.|$|E
