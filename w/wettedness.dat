The clothing ensemble had an effective insulation of approximately 1 clo. From the analysis of the present experimental data, the following conclusions were found regarding characteristics of <b>wettedness</b> observed by clothed subjects at a constant average skin temperature, 1. <b>Wettedness</b> correlates negatively with the air temperature and correlates positively with the vapor pressure. 2. Evaporative heat loss from the skin surface correlates positively with the air temperature and correlates negatively with the vapor pressure. 3. <b>Wettedness</b> correlates negatively with evaporative heat loss. 4. At a constant average skin temperature, the value of <b>wettedness</b> is variable and both maximum and minimum values exist. The results stated above indicate the same tendency as the results obtained from the experiments using naked subjects.

40|$|Excessive {{sweating}} {{is a major}} ergonomic {{concern in}} bicycle helmet use and low wearing rates are suspected to originate, at least partly, from impaired thermal comfort due to accumulated sweat increasing skin <b>wettedness</b> at the head region. As a development from COST Action TU 1101 WG 4, we introduce a modelling framework for assessing the thermal comfort of bicy-cle helmet use. We predicted local sweat rate (LSR) at the head region as ratio to gross sweat rate (GSR) of the whole body and also based on sudomotor sensitivity (SUD), which relates the change in LSR to the change in body core temperature (ΔTre). We coupled those local models with models of thermoregulation predicting ΔTre and GSR, thus modelling head sweating in re-sponse to {{the characteristics of the}} thermal environment, clothing, level of activity, and expo-sure duration. We then validated the predictions of several local models (SUD, LSR/GSR) com-bined with different whole-body models against head sweat rates measured in the laboratory. Eventually, we developed thermal comfort criteria from head LSR by relating skin <b>wettedness</b> to the thermal properties of bicycle helmets. We discuss the potential of this approach as well as needs for further research...|$|E

We proposed a prediction formula of heart rate in hot environment based on our model. This formula was defined as functions of VO 2 max, metabolic rate, mean skin temperature and cardiorespiratory capacity level, and was able to predict heart rate considering individual cardiorespiratory capacity. A coefficient kadp of individual variability on regulatory thermal sweating was identified, which equals 1 for an average person. The analysis of sweating characteristics using human experimental data indicated that the variation of kadp appeared not only between individual subjects but between the same subjects.

This study has been made to examine ethnic differences in thermal responses and human thermal comfort sensation between Japanese and Caucasians under a temperate environment. Young healthy Japanese and Caucasian males voluntary participated in the present study. In the study, they firstly kept a rest condition and walked on a treadmill in the exercise condition. Japanese showed significantly higher mean skin temperature than Caucasian during a whole period of the experiment. Although the water vapour pressure over the skin surface during the rest was statistically slightly higher in Caucasian than in Japanese, calculated evaporation rate from the body surface in Japanese was significantly larger than that in Caucasians. This was because the temperature difference between the skin surface and the environment was larger in Japanese than in Caucasians. Calculated evaporation rate from the body surface during the exercise was found to be significantly larger in Japanese than in Caucasian because both of temperature and water vapour pressure of the skin surface showed remarkably higher values in Japanese than in Caucasians.

40|$|Abstract]: The {{effect of}} fabric type, colour, fit and <b>wettedness</b> on {{ultraviolet}} transmission through garments was investigated using a multivariate experimental design. Garments were assessed {{under conditions of}} simulated use in Queensland, Australia using polysulphone dosimeters. Dosimeters, placed against the skin and on the adjacent upper-surface of the covering garment, were used to measure solar erythemal radiation at selected sites on the torso. The effect of fabric type, colour, and wetness on ultraviolet transmission (UVR and UVB) was also determined under laboratory conditions using a spectrophotometer. Measurement of UVR using laboratory testing may mask the effect of variables on UVB transmission. During simulated wear, the fabric type and fit had the main effect on UVB transmission through the garments.

40|$|Thermal comfort models - {{specifically}} the J. B. Pierce two-node model of human thermoregulation and the Fanger Comfort Equation - predict comfort responses of individuals exposed to thermal environments {{under conditions of}} either rest or exercise. This paper evaluates the ability of these two models to predict the physiological variables underlying thermal comfort {{over a wide range}} of still air environments (effective temperature between 5 °C and 45 °C) and exercise intensities (rest to 85 % of maximal aerobic capacity). The physiological data base used for comparison was taken from several published and as-yet unpublished studies at three different laboratories. Values of core temperature (TCR), skin temperature (TSK) and skin <b>wettedness</b> (w), predicted by the Pierce two-node model, and PMV, predicted by the Fanger model, differed significantly from observed values (P<. 05). The Pierce model tended to underestimate w (mean error = -. 16) and TCR (mean error = -. 31 °C), and to overpredict TSK (mean error =. 48 °C). Skin <b>wettedness</b> predictions were less accurate for high exercise intensity (6 to 8 met) than for rest, low exercise intensity (i to 3. 5 met) or moderate exercise intensity (3. 5 to 6 met). Accuracy was higher for males than females, and greater for females in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle than females in the luteal phase. Errors in TSK predictions were also associated with exercise intensity but not associated with either gender or effective temperature. TCR predictions were significantly more accurate for females than for males. The average error associated with PMV predictions was 1. 26 scaling units and was related to both effective temperature (ET*) and exercise intensity. Based on multiple linear regression with ET and exercise intensity, the expected error in PMV was approximately zero at ET= 28 °C for resting subjects. The magnitude of error increased by approximately. 3 scaling units for each l°C change in ET, and by approximately 1. 3 scaling units for each increase in exercise intensity level (e. g. rest to low) ...|$|E

The subjects, dressed in briefs, were exposed to cyclic variations for 120 min in air temperatures between 51 degrees C and 23 degrees C, under three different schedules involving heat pulses of 10 -min, 20 -min and 30 -min duration, respectively. The strain induced by each of these conditions was compared {{in terms of both}} physiological and perceptual criteria. Results showed that between conditions, there were significant differences in skin temperature levels but not in core temperature levels, body heat storage, or body weight loss.

The research design consisted of a causal study utilising an amalgamation of both observational and ex post facto data collection techniques employing a cross sectional case study approach within a field study research environment. Findings from the research indicate that motor-manual tree felling and delimbing are tasks not necessarily analogous with excessively high levels of fatigue, even though the physiological measures categorised motor-manual felling and delimbing as being moderate to heavy workload tasks. Chronic fatigue was avoided, and acute fatigue mitigated by the effective use of the fallers self-pacing mechanism, combined with both structured and spontaneous rest breaks analogous with the work method adopted by motor-manual fallers. Consequently, production was not negatively affected by the progression of the working day. Poor work postures commonly adopted by the fallers encourage the progressive development musculo-skeletal damage.

40|$|The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) {{aimed for}} a {{one-dimensional}} quantity adequately reflecting the human physiological {{reaction to the}} multi-dimensionally defined actual outdoor thermal environment. The human reaction was simulated by the UTCI-Fiala multi-node model of human thermoregulation, which was integrated with an adaptive clothing model. Following {{the concept of an}} equivalent temperature, UTCI for a given combination of wind speed, radiation, humidity and air temperature was defined as the air temperature of the reference environment, which according to the model produces an equivalent dynamic physiological response. Operationalising this concept involved (1) the definition of a reference environment with 50 % relative humidity (but vapour pressure capped at 20 hPa), with calm air and radiant temperature equalling air temperature and (2) the development of a one-dimensional representation of the multivariate model output at different exposure times. The latter was achieved by principal component analyses showing that the linear combination of 7 parameters of thermophysiological strain (core, mean and facial skin temperatures, sweat production, skin <b>wettedness,</b> skin blood flow, shivering) after 30 and 120 min exposure time accounted for two-thirds of the total variation in the multi-dimensional dynamic physiological response. The operational procedure was completed by a scale categorising UTCI equivalent temperature values in terms of thermal stress, and by providing simplified routines for fast but sufficiently accurate calculation, which included look-up tables of pre-calculated UTCI values for a grid of all relevant combinations of climate parameters and polynomial regression equations predicting UTCI over the same grid.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{pertaining to}} models of human thermoregulation is critically reviewed. It is concluded {{that none of}} the models investigated can be used to predict the physiological response of acclimatized men required to work in the heat for extended periods of time, the reasons being: (i) physiological conductance (the lumped parameter describing internal heat transfer) has not been completely described in terms of all the variables effecting it (ii) the dynamic nature of the sweat rate response has never been mathematically described. A composite block diagram model for human thermoregulation, based on a single cylinder core and shell model of the controlled system, is postulated as a feasible {{solution to the problem of}} predicting physiological responses to work in the heat. The controlling system, consisting of physiological conductance and sweat rate, is singled out for thorough investigation. Detailed experimentation was carried out on a single nude acclimatized man over a wide range of environments (13, 6 °C dry-bulb, 9, 2 °C wet-bulb to 38, 5 °C dry-bulb, 36, 5 °C wet-bulb) and work rates (resting, 60 W/m 2 to exercising, 240 W/m 2). Each experiment lasted four hours. Physiological conductance (K) is expressed as a sigmoidal function of a weighted body temperature driving signal (Tmb) and metabolic rate (M), such that for the same Tmb, K increases with increasing M. The saturation level of K at low Tm b is expressed as a linear function of M, the saturation level of K at high Tmb, is expressed as an exponential function of M. Because of the dynamic nature of the sweat rate response to a step change in environmental conditions and/or work rate, basic engineering control theory is used tc formulate a block diagram model for thermoregulatory sweating. The model introduces a rational approach to combining Tmb, local effect of skin temperature, sweat gland fatigue, skin <b>wettedness</b> and their time histories...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} heat acclimation on sweat rate redistribution and thermodynamic parameters, 9 tropical native volunteers were submitted to 11 days of exercise-heat exposures (400 °C and 45. 10. 2 % relative humidity). Sudomotor function was evaluated by measuring total and local (forehead, chest, arm, forearm, and thigh) sweat rates, local sweat sodium concentration, and mean skin and rectal temperatures. We also calculated heat production (H), heat storage (S), heat exchange by radiation (R) and by convection (C), evaporated sweat (Esw), sweating efficiency (h sw), skin <b>wettedness</b> (wsk), and the ratio between the heat storage and the sum of heat production and heat gains by radiation and convection (S/(HRC)). The heat acclimation increased the whole-body sweat rate and reduced the mean skin temperature. There were changes in the local sweat rate patterns: on the arm, forearm, and thigh it increased significantly from day 1 to day 11 (all p 0. 05) and the sweat rates from the forehead and the chest showed a small nonsignificant increase (p 0. 34 and 0. 17, respectively). The relative increase of local sweat rates on day 11 was not different among the sites; however, when comparing the limbs (arm, forearm, and thigh) with the trunk (forehead and chest), {{there was a significant}} higher increase in the limbs (325 %) in comparison to the trunk (112 %, p 0. 001). After the heat acclimation period we observed higher wsk and Esw and reduced S/(HRC), meaning greater thermoregulatory efficiency. The increase in the limb sweat rate, but not the increase in the trunk sweat rate, correlated with the increased wsk, Esw, and reduced S/(HRC) (p 0. 05 to all). Altogether, it can be concluded that heat acclimation increased the limbs ’ sweat rates in tropical natives and that this increase led to increased loss of heat through evaporation of sweat and this higher sweat evaporation was related to highe...|$|E

We also calculated heat production (H), heat storage (S), heat exchange by radiation (R) and by convection (C), evaporated sweat (E(sw)), sweating efficiency (eta(sw)), skin <b>wettedness</b> (w(sk)), and the ratio between the heat storage and the sum of heat production and heat gains by radiation and convection (S/(H+R+C)). The heat acclimation increased the whole-body sweat rate and reduced the mean skin temperature. There were changes in the local sweat rate patterns: on the arm, forearm, and thigh it increased significantly from day 1 to day 11 (all p< 0. 05) and the sweat rates from the forehead and the chest showed a small nonsignificant increase (p= 0. 34 and 0. 17, respectively). The relative increase of local sweat rates on day 11 was not different among the sites; however, when comparing the limbs (arm, forearm, and thigh) with the trunk (forehead and chest), {{there was a significant}} higher increase in the limbs (32 +/- 5 %) in comparison to the trunk (11 +/- 2 %, p= 0. 001). After the heat acclimation period we observed higher w(sk) and E(sw) and reduced S/(H+R+C), meaning greater thermoregulatory efficiency. The increase in the limb sweat rate, but not the increase in the trunk sweat rate, correlated with the increased w(sk), E(sw), and reduced S/(H+R+C) (p< 0. 05 to all). Altogether, it can be concluded that heat acclimation increased the limbs` sweat rates in tropical natives and that this increase led to increased loss of heat through evaporation of sweat and this higher sweat evaporation was related to higher thermoregulatory efficiency.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, International Journal of Biometeorology [© ISB (Springer) and the definitive version is available at: [URL] Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) aimed for a one-dimensional quantity adequately reflecting the human physiological reaction to the multi-dimensionally defined actual outdoor thermal environment. The human reaction was simulated by the UTCI-Fiala multi-node model of human thermoregulation, which was integrated with an adaptive clothing model. Following the concept of an equivalent temperature, UTCI for a given combination of wind speed, radiation, humidity and air temperature was defined as the air temperature of the reference environment, which according to the model produces an equivalent dynamic physiological response. Operationalising this concept involved (1) the definition of a reference environment with 50 % relative humidity (but vapour pressure capped at 20 hPa), with calm air and radiant temperature equalling air temperature and (2) the development of a one-dimensional representation of the multivariate model output at different exposure times. The latter was achieved by principal component analyses showing that the linear combination of 7 parameters of thermophysiological strain (core, mean and facial skin temperatures, sweat production, skin <b>wettedness,</b> skin blood flow, shivering) after 30 and 120 min exposure time accounted for two-thirds of the total variation in the multi-dimensional dynamic physiological response. The operational procedure was completed by a scale categorising UTCI equivalent temperature values in terms of thermal stress, and by providing simplified routines for fast but sufficiently accurate calculation, which included look-up tables of pre-calculated UTCI values for a grid of all relevant combinations of climate parameters and polynomial regression equations predicting UTCI over the same grid. The analyses of the sensitivity of UTCI to humidity, radiation and wind speed showed plausible reactions in the heat {{as well as in the}} cold, and indicate that UTCI may in this regard be universally useable in the major areas of research and application in human biometeorology...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} air {{velocity}} in promoting cooling through the evaporation of sweat generated when {{working at a}} high metabolic rate and/or in hot environments is well known. Many of the environmental heat stress indices consider the effect of air movement directly or indirectly within their determination, be it {{through the use of}} a specific instrument i. e. a wet-bulb globe temperature meter or Kata thermometer, or inclusion of in the calculation of a stress index, including the effective temperature, air cooling power, thermal working limit, ISO 7933 ?s predicted heat strain model. Within these models, ambient air temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure are also considered in varying degrees to quantify an airstream?s capacity to evaporate sweat. Deep mine studies have shown cumulative increases in heat exhaustion rates with both decreasing air velocity and decreasing air cooling powers. However, despite a capacity to cool, the resultant cooling is very dependant on sweat production and its availability for evaporation; these are included where sweat rates and skin <b>wettedness</b> are considered. The first depends on hydration and physiological factors whereas the second is more an engineering factor related to the degree of clothing required. As sweat rates deteriorate with aging, the benefits of evaporative cooling potential can similarly be expected to be diminished. This paper continues to report upon on-going physiological studies exploring the potential for heat stress in deep underground mines through the simulation of mining activities in environmental chambers and a human calorimeter facility. The focus of this paper is to introduce preliminary data suggesting that increasing air velocity (0. 5, 1. 5 & 3. 0 m/s) is beneficial for young subjects (22 1 1 yrs), as indicated by lower core and skin temperature measures and heart rate during an intermittent work protocol, and then show a lesser benefit for older subjects (62 1 2 yrs).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Regional differences in sweat gland output, skin temperature and thermoreceptor distribution can account for variations in regional perceptions of temperature, thermal comfort and wetness sensation. Large cohorts of studies have assessed these perceptual responses during sedentary activity but the findings are typically applied to a multitude of conditions, including exercise. Increases in sweat gland output, redistribution of blood flow and changes in skin and core temperature are basic responses to exercise in most conditions and these ultimately influence our perceptual responses. The primary aim of this thesis is to determine factors that influence regional differences in thermal sensation, thermal comfort and wetness sensation during exercise in moderate to hot conditions. The secondary aim is to develop and understand an additional variable, galvanic skin conductance (GSC) {{that can be used}} to predict thermal comfort and wetness sensation. The aim of the first study (Chapter 4) was to determine the influence of exercise on thermal sensitivity and magnitude sensation of warmth to a hot-dry stimulus (thermal probe at 40 °C) and assess if any gender-linked differences and/or regional differences exist. From the data, body maps indicating sensitivity were produced for both genders during rest and exercise. Females had more regional differences than males. Overall sensitivity was greatest at the head, then the torso and declined towards the extremities. The data showed that exercise did not cause a significant reduction in thermal sensitivity but magnitude estimation was significantly lower after exercise for males and selected locations in females. The cause of a reduced magnitude sensation is thought to be associated with exercise induced analgesia; a reduction in sensitivity due to exercise related increases in circulating hormones. As the literature suggests that thermal comfort in the heat is influenced by the presence of sweat, the next study and all proceeding studies were concerned with this concept. In Chapter 5, building on earlier studies performed in our laboratories, the influence of local skin <b>wettedness</b> (wlocal) on local thermal comfort and wetness sensation was investigated in a neutral dry condition (20. 2 ± 0. 5 °C and 43. 5 ± 4. 5...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Female {{participation}} in high-contact sports {{has increased dramatically}} {{in the past two}} decades, raising concern regarding injury to the female breast and the need for protective equipment. While the use of chest/breast protectors by women is advocated, little is known of their efficacy and effect on athletic performance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of chest/breast protector use on measures of performance and comfort, and to determine the mechanical response of the protectors to applied impacts. The four chest/breast protectors selected for study included rigid polyethylene and flexible closed-cell foam styles. To evaluate physiological and comfort differences among the control (no protector) condition and the protectors, female subjects completed a submaximal treadmill running protocol, during which metabolic, skin temperature and perceived comfort data were collected. To evaluate effects on general agility, subjects completed a timed agility test. To assess cushioning properties, the vertical acceleration-time and force-displacement histories of a projectile during surface contact with each protector were analyzed using a drop test method. Analysis of variance methods were used to compare metabolic, temperature, comfort, agility, and energy absorption variables. Graphic presentations accompanied by qualitative interpretation of data across the time history of the impacts were used to describe cushioning properties of the protectors. The chest/breast protectors in this study did not significantly increase oxygen consumption for submaximal treadmill running. Some but not all protectors produced significantly higher skin temperatures than the no-protector condition. Greater temperatures and temperature differentials between the skin and exterior equipment surface were associated with multiple plastic/fabric layers and closed-cell foam construction. No protectors produced significantly higher ratings of thermal sensation or perceived skin <b>wettedness</b> than the control condition. Two protectors were assessed as similar to the control condition on general comfort sensation while two were deemed to be significantly less comfortable. There was no decrease in general agility associated with protector wear. The closed cell foam protector generally showed better shock attenuation characteristics, while the rigid protectors generally demonstrated superior shock absorption.

In a balanced order, participants walked at 35 % VO 2 max for 45 minutes (WALK) (29. 0 ± 1. 9 °C, 29. 8 ± 3. 6 % RH, no wind) in one test {{and in a}} separate test ran at 70 % VO 2 max for 45 minutes (RUN) (26. 2 ± 2. 1 °C, 31. 1 ± 7. 0 % RH, no wind). During both tests, participants wore a loose fitting 100 % polyester long sleeve top and trouser ensemble with a low resistance to heat and vapour transfer (total thermal resistance of 0. 154 m 2 ∙K∙W- 1 and total water vapour resistance of 35. 9 m 2 ∙Pa∙W- 1). wlocal, change from baseline in GSC (ΔGSC) and local thermal comfort were recorded every 5 minutes. The results suggest that both wlocal and ΔGSC are strong predictors of thermal comfort during the WALK when sweat production is low and thermal discomfort minimal (r 2 > 0. 78 and r 2 > 0. 71, respectively). Interestingly, during the RUN wlocal plateaued at ~ 0. 6 - 0. 8 due to the high sweat production, whilst ΔGSC gradually increased throughout the experiment. ΔGSC had a similar relationship with thermal comfort to wlocal during the RUN (r 2 > 0. 95 and r 2 > 0. 94, respectively). Despite the strength of these relationships, the ability of wlocal to predict local thermal comfort accurately dramatically reduces in the exponential part of the curve. In a situation of uncompensated heat stress such as high metabolic rate in hot climate, where sweat production is high, ΔGSC shows {{to be a better}} predictor of local thermal comfort than wlocal.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Much of the {{research}} of thermal and physical comfort is completed with healthy participants in regular life scenarios. The translation of these findings into clinical settings for people with disease, deficiency or restrictions adds a level of complexity. As an example this study evaluated {{the effectiveness of a}} patient warming mattress device on body temperature and ratings of thermal comfort/sensation. Hypothermia has been linked to higher mortality rates in trauma patients admitted to hospital. Patient warming devices have been developed to assist the temperature of the patient and studies on these report varied effects. Laboratory trials with shivering inhibition (Goheen et al, 1997, Greif et al, 2000) found improvements from forced air and resistive blankets but without shivering inhibition (Williams et al, 2005) showed no benefit in warming from 35 °C. A physical evaluation of the warming mattress device with a thermal manikin reported an energy contribution to the user (70 W). To support the physical evaluation a user trial was conducted. Nine healthy volunteer participants (27. 78 + 4. 99 Years) were exposed to three conditions using a repeated measures counterbalanced design. The participants were cooled in an environment with an air temperature of 0 °C (60 minutes) then exposed to 30 minutes of a warming intervention. 1. Hot mattress HM. Mattress preheated to 18 °C, under standard blankets 2. Warmed mattress WM. Mattress turned on at start of warming period, under standard blankets 3. Cold mattress CM. Control condition, no power to mattress, under standard blankets. During the cooling phase, aural and mean skin temperature (Tsk) significantly decreased for all conditions (p< 0. 01). Tsk increased following each warming intervention but aural temperature continued to decline. Significant increase in overall mean thermal comfort was seen during the first ten minutes of the warming phase for HM in comparison to CM and WM (p< 0. 05) but not at 20 and 30 minutes. This was mirrored by the overall mean thermal sensation rating across the same timeframe. HM increased thermal sensation from very cold to cool with CM and WM showing and increase from very cold to cold. This study revealed the effect of the device (HM) gave short term comfort and sensation gains {{at the start of the}} warming phase but the passive insulation provided (CM) also allowed re-warming to occur. This was the expected thermoregulatory response for a group of healthy participants. This group does not necessarily represent the hospital population with pathology that inhibits their normal responses to cold, e. g. circulatory shut-down, shock or trauma. For accurate application, the trial data needs to be closely matched with the limitations of the health condition in the target population. The challenge is now to explore the relationship between data from healthy cohorts and how that can be used for groups of patients with known physical and physiological conditions and limitations. The validity of a patient’s subjective assessment of their condition lying in a hospital bed is currently unclear. Evidence needs to show whether a patient in a hospital bed can accurately report joint position, thermal comfort, skin <b>wettedness,</b> pressure points etc to assist in the management of their condition...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the physiological strain on industrial workers under thermal stress on extended shifts. To continuously measure deep body core temperatures, heart rates, fluid intake, changes in hydration state and physical fatigue {{in order to}} establish acceptable levels of physiological strain. To develop a rational heat stress index compatible with these limits. To design working-in-heat protocols for a self-paced workforce. Methods: A series of studies was conducted over 77 shifts on a group of approximately 50 male volunteers working in thermally stressful environments. Continuously- recorded deep body core temperatures, heart rates, fluid consumption, urinary specific gravity and physical fatigue were measured and recorded. A new field protocol was developed to assess physical fatigue over the working shift. An original methodology was developed to allow any heat stress index to be assessed on a comparative basis with any other index. A review of the commonly used occupational heat stress indices was conducted. A new rational heat stress index was developed, based on existing biophysical relationships and recommended physiological strain limits of deep body core temperature and sweat rate. New protocols designed for self-paced work incorporating the significant risk factors for heat illness were developed and implemented in a workforce of approximately 2000 workers exposed to heat stress. The previous protocols used a shortened shift as the primary intervention to protect worker health. The subsequent protocols removed the shortened shift and replaced this with a range of other interventions. Deep body core temperature, heart rate, fluid consumption, hydration state and fatigue were measured before and after the changes in protocols. Results: Comparisons of heat stress indices confirmed the wide divergence in guidance provided by many of the commonly-used indices in terms of acceptable working environments. It also highlighted a number of serious shortcomings in the most widely-used indices, especially WBGT and ISO 7933. A new, rational heat stress index called Thermal Work Limit (TWL) was developed. This included development of a computer model incorporating key thermal physiological parameters (deep body core temperature, mean skin temperature, sweat rate, skin <b>wettedness).</b> There was no increase in heat stress (as indicated by average workplace environmental conditions), deep body core temperature, mean heart rate, or changes in hydration status after the changes in protocols. Average environmental conditions were severe (WBGT 30. 9 ° C, sd 2. 0 ° C, range 25. 7 - 35. 2 ° C). Environmental conditions in the study were much hotter than those considered acceptable under standards such as the ACGIH. The results showed that miners regularly exceeded those limits allowable under most current indices in terms of maximum deep body core temperature (avg 38. 3 ° C, std dev 0. 4 ° C), maximum temperature rise (1. 4 ° C, 0. 4 ° C) and maximum heat storage (431 kJ, 163 kJ), without reporting any symptoms of heat illness. A significant component of the observed elevated core temperatures was due to the normal circadian rhythm, which was measured at 0. 9 ° C (std dev 0. 2 ° C). Evidence was found that workers "self-pace" when under thermal stress. Fluid intake averaged 0. 8 l/h during exposure (sd 0. 3 l/h, range 0. 3 - 1. 5 1 /h). Average urinary specific gravity at start-, mid- and end of shift was 1. 0251, 1. 0248 and 1. 0254 respectively; the differences between start and mid-shift, mid and end-shift, and start and end-shift were not significant. However, a majority of workers were coming to work in a moderately hypohydrated state (urinary specific gravity avg 1. 024, std dev 0. 0059). Involuntary dehydration was not found to occur in the study group. This is in contrast to several other studies and some of the leading heat stress standards, which are {{based on the premise that}} workers are unable to maintain their hydration status when working in the heat, even when their fluid consumption is equal to their sweat rate. Continuous heart rates measured over a shift (avg 103 bpm, 14 % of shifts exceeding avg 110 bpm, 5 % exceeding avg 120 bpm) were in excess of those allowable under most current indices On average, workers experienced a peak 10 - minute heart rate of 140 bpm and a peak 30 -minute heart rate of 130 bpm during their shifts. There was a significant increase in fatigue in the first half of the working shift (P= 0. 001), with workers on average showing a significant recovery in the second half of their shift (p= 0. 04). Conclusions: Current heat stress indices provide little common agreement as to acceptable levels of thermal strain or stress for workers, at equivalent levels of environmental stress. IS 07933 is seriously flawed and the ACGIH WBGT guidelines are too conservative for acclimatised workers and are unlikely to become widely adopted by industries with well-acclimatised workers. Many of the existing indices show internal inconsistencies. Most of the physiological heat strain limits used in existing rational heat stress indices (in terms of deep body core temperature and heart rate) are conservative for self-paced, acclimatise d, non-dehydrating male workers. Involuntary dehydration is not unavoidable when acclimatised workers are exposed to thermal stress. Heat stress standards should not limit heat exposure durations for self- paced workers who have access to water on the basis of an unavoidable body water loss. Physical fatigue does occur in workers under heat stress on extended shifts; however, most workers show a significant increase in fatigue in the first half of their shift; whereas data indicates self-paced workers undergo significant recovery in terms of fatigue in the second half of the shift. As the heat exposures in this study cover a wide range of temperatures, humidity levels, wind speeds, body morphology and VO 2 max, these conclusions are applicable to most thermally stressful settings involving well-informed, well-acclimatised and self-paced male workers. The major category of work type not covered by this study is that of workers in fully-encapsulated (vapour-barrier) protective clothing. In addition, this study examined acute effects of heat stress and strain, not effects that might only be manifest with chronic exposure to heat...|$|E
