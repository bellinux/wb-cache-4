25|$|Durousseau and {{his wife}} moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where they had two daughters. It was during that period that he {{committed}} most of the murders. He struggled to keep jobs and make ends meet, and the couple would often have fights {{over the issue of}} finances. In 1999, the police advised Durousseau's wife on how to file for a restraining order after he allegedly slapped her in the face and grabbed her by the neck. Later, she testified he got violently angry <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> about getting a divorce. In September and October 2001, Durousseau spent 48 days in jail for domestic battery.|$|E
500|$|Hathaway, by contrast, {{actively}} {{sought the}} part, tracing [...] "Hire me" [...] {{in the sand}} of the zen garden on Hacken's desk <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> about the project with the executive. While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to audition, {{she knew she was}} not the studio's first choice and had to be patient (other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead). Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies. She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects. She celebrated when she learned she had gotten the part.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the lines}} in the episode proved {{difficult}} for both fans and cast members to embrace. Fans did not readily accept that The Smoking Man was Mulder's father. Davis, who portrayed The Smoking Man, noted that fans {{did not believe the}} revelation because [...] "part of the mystique of it was that everybody had their own idea of what was going on." [...] The dialogue in the episode proved difficult for Anderson to present believably. She was troubled that her character was arguing against the existence of extraterrestrials, when in the previous episode her character had encountered an alien shipwreck. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> to Carter, she said that she did not [...] "know if [...] do this anymore" [...] because her character was arguing against information that had been confirmed in the first two parts of the episode. Carter explained that there must be conflict between Mulder and Scully for the show's [...] "believer versus skeptic" [...] dynamic to work properly.|$|E
60|$|There she stands-painted by herself. No witness but {{herself has}} been allowed to testify. She stands there painted by her acts, and {{decorated}} by her words. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks,</b> <b>she</b> has only a decorative value as a witness, either for or against herself, for she deals mainly in unsupported assertion; and in the rare cases where she puts forward a verifiable fact she gets out of it a meaning which it refuses to furnish to anybody else. Also, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks,</b> <b>she</b> is unstable, she wanders, she is incurably inconsistent; what she says to-day she contradicts tomorrow.|$|R

500|$|Following its {{premature}} release on the Web, the music video for [...] "You and I" [...] met with positive reviews. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone felt the video was {{an improvement over}} her earlier videos, Judas and The Edge of Glory, saying, [...] "the best moments of the video put a distinctly Gaga-ish spin on the iconography of Americana and traditional love stories." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote the video has: [...] "torture contraptions, mermaid sex, a wedding, bondage in a barn, an ice cream truck, and to top it all off, 'Children of the Corn' and religious overtones thrown in for good measure," [...] and thought [...] the video setting was the strangest representation of Nebraska. Leah Collins of Dose felt the video was a [...] "great opportunity for the singer to finally find out what it's like to make out with herself." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted of the scene in which Gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego: [...] "She's just Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, playing a piano {{in the middle of}} a corn field—with a little making out on the side, of course." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV News believed that Gaga was not joking <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> about the video being about the [...] "torture" [...] of being away from the one you love. [...] "And, man, based on the bruising final product, she wasn't kidding," [...] Kaufman concluded.|$|E

40|$|We compare {{communication}} about {{private information}} to communication about actions in a one- shot 2 -person public good game with private information. The informed player, {{who knows the}} exact return from contributing and whose contribution is unobserved, can send a message about the return or her contribution. Theoretically, messages can elicit the uninformed player's contribution, and allow the informed player to free-ride. The exact language used {{is not expected to}} matter. Experimentally, however, we find that free-riding depends on the language: the informed player free-rides less, and thereby lies less frequently, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about her contribution than <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about the return. Further experimental evidence indicates that it is the promise component in messages about the contribution that leads to less free-riding and less lying. ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'How should I know? Didst thou not--no, {{that was}} after the Army rose {{out of the earth}} and took thee away. I abode there in {{meditation}} in a room against the dovecot--except <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> eternally.' ...|$|E

40|$|We compare {{signaling}} by {{words and}} actions in a one-shot 2 -person public good game with private information. The informed player, who knows the exact return from contributing, can signal by contributing first (actions) or by sending a costless message (words). Words can be about the return or about her contribution decision. Theoretically, actions lead to fully e¢ cient contributions. Words can be as influential as actions, and thus elicit the uninformed player's contribution, but allow the informed player to free-ride. The exact language used {{is not expected to}} matter. Experimentally, we find that words can be as influential as actions. Free-riding, however, does depend on the language: the informed player free-rides less <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about her contribution than <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about the returns. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "You know, mother, I {{think there}} must be {{something}} the matter with me, that I CAN'T love. <b>When</b> <b>she's</b> there, as a rule, I DO love her. Sometimes, when I see her just as THE WOMAN, I love her, mother; but then, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> and criticises, I often don't listen to her." ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{a little}} more than a week after Edna's {{adventure}} in the Gardens, and about ten o'clock in the morning, that something happened--something which proved that Mrs. Cliff was entirely right <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> about the feeling in her bones.

60|$|The lady {{understood}} it better; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> {{it over with}} her husband in the evening, they were convinced the cause of his trouble must be some unfortunate attachment, which he might think it his duty to overcome; and having settled this, they became very fond of him, and anxious to make Redclyffe agreeable to him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I entirely {{disagree}} with you," [...] exclaimed Mary. She was somehow always {{out of breath}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked.</b> And her speech was punctuated by little gasps.

6000|$|This was {{a blow to}} me. I {{had always}} looked on Pamela as a well-drawn character, and a very attractive, {{kittenish}} little thing at that.
