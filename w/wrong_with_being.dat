Marlene was played by Pamela Reed, who would continue to make several guest appearances as the character. During the casting auditions, Seth Gordon interviewed Reed {{as if she were}} playing the character and Reed improvised a great deal, creating many personality elements that were eventually incorporated into Marlene Knope's character. Gordon said, [...] "Pamela was especially sort of nimble on her feet at inventing a character in the room on the fly, and I thought that was really impressive."

2500|$|Besides {{the need}} to be thin, young, and rich, there is also a weight {{prejudice}} within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. These high standards for women to follow and live up to mixed with the practical impossibilities of achieving such standards develops an attitude from women that thinness is extremely desirable. Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. [...] Actress/Comedian Amy Schummer spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in Glamour Magazine as a [...] "Plus Size Woman." [...] Upon the magazines publication, Schummer fired a tweet saying, [...] "I think there's nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8." [...] Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see. The problem in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.|$|E
5000|$|The pledge has {{received}} a mixed reaction. Some questioned {{the need for a}} pledge at all. The reference to God in the pledge is a source of some element of controversy too. House of Assembly member, Alvera Maduro-Caines argued it was appropriate.

Others felt the overtly religious reference infringed their rights. The leader of the People’s Empowerment Party, Natalio D. Wheatley, said there was a [...] "glaring problem" [...] with the pledge: that it is [...] "oxymoronic" [...] to refer to a territory as a country. The use of the capitalised term [...] "Territory" [...] suggests the word is part of the territory's name when it's not. Grammatically, the reference to [...] "these Virgin Islands" [...] rather than [...] "the Virgin Islands" [...] {{at the end of the}} pledge renders the pledge ungrammatical when recited outside the territory. There was little public engagement concerning the wording of the pledge before its adoption.|$|R

However, when Vanessa is turned off, Matt decides to circumcise himself after reading a 'how-to guide' on the Internet.

After the surgery, Matt discovers that Vanessa was not turned off by his foreskin but is in fact a lesbian and {{having an affair with a}} popular cheerleader, Ridley. When Ridley shows signs of wanting to end their affair, Vanessa asks Matt to have a threesome with them to keep Ridley interested.

Weeks later, Matt and his friend Henry commit a hit and run while under the influence of marijuana. Both cover up their involvement, but both grow attached to the victim, an outsider whose strict Christian Scientist mother won't allow her to have the necessary surgery to repair her injuries.|$|R

40|$|This article centres around objectification. It {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the notions that are involved in this phenomenon, their moral wrongness, as well as the connections that exist between them. Martha Nussbaum has suggested that seven notions are involved in objectification: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity. She espouses the view that the instrumentalisation of human beings (the treatment of human beings instrumentally to achieve our purposes) is especially problematic as compared to the other ways in which we can treat human beings as objects (for example, denying their autonomy and subjectivity, or treating them as violable). In this paper, I argue against the view that instrumentalisation should be thought of as more suspicious from a moral point of view {{than the rest of the}} ways in which people can be treated as objects. Singling out extreme instrumentality for being especially problematic might lead us to underestimate the wrongness involved in the other ways of treating human beings as objects, and can therefore potentially distort our understanding of what, more generally, is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> objectifying human <b>beings...</b>|$|R
