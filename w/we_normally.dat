25|$|Color: In the {{evaluation}} of colored gemstones, color {{is the most important}} factor. Color divides into three components: hue, saturation and tone. Hue refers to color as <b>we</b> <b>normally</b> use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the pure spectral hues of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.|$|E
25|$|When {{analyzing}} {{an inverse}} problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model {{is usually not}} sufficient, as <b>we</b> <b>normally</b> also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case {{we may have a}} large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models {{in such a way that}} information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available.|$|E

500|$|Critics gave {{positive}} reviews {{towards the}} overall gameplay mechanics, although they often presented some reservations. Several reviews praised {{the simplicity of}} the game interface. Andre Thomas of GamePlasma described the game's learning curve as [...] "incredibly simple" [...] and the gameplay mechanics as logical extension of those from the adventure games of the 1990s, while GamingTrend reviewer Ron Burke praised Telltale's [...] "intuitive" [...] point-and-click system. Mark Smith of Game Chronicles, however, stated that the streamlined mechanics eliminated [...] "a lot of the exploration and discovery <b>we</b> <b>normally</b> associate with these types of games". Some reviews directed criticism towards puzzle design; according to Smith, the game is [...] "certainly accessible to kids and younger teens", but the adult audience [...] "will find these games way too easy". Reviewing for Adventure Gamers, Evan Dickens felt that the puzzles took [...] "a bit of thought and consideration, but never to a point of consternation", believing that the low difficulty was intended by Telltale to allow players to [...] "proceed through the story with minimum frustration". Hypers Tim Henderson commends the game for being [...] "highly accessible [...] almost as funny as the original". However, he criticises it for its episodic content being a [...] "tease".|$|E

Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than <b>we</b> <b>normally</b> see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant."
