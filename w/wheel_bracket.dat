5000|$|... #Caption: The {{interior}} of a wheellock mechanism from a [...] "puffer" [...] or pistol made in Augsburg in about 1580. The mechanism is shown at rest, with the long arm of the mainspring resting {{on the bottom of}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>bracket.</b> Invisible behind the <b>wheel</b> <b>bracket</b> is the chain linking the end of the mainspring with the eccentric on the wheel shaft. Also not visible are the sear spring (hidden behind the sear arm itself) and the secondary sear (the end can just be seen to the right of the end of the main sear arm). Note the [...] "nose" [...] of the main sear going through a hole in the lock plate where it engages with the wheel on the other side.|$|E
50|$|On 18 October 2005, MCR-01 OB-1701 {{suffered}} a {{nose landing gear}} collapse while taxiing before takeoff for a training flight at Las Dunas airport (SPLH), Ica, Peru. Both pilots were uninjured. However, the aircraft suffered significant damage to the nose, engine and propeller. After investigation by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Peru {{it was found that}} the nose gear strut broke at a point where it was welded to the <b>wheel</b> <b>bracket,</b> and this was probably caused by a combination of fatigue, corrosion and a design fault. As a result, both MCR-01 aircraft registered in Peru were grounded by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Peru and declared unairworthy, until a satisfactory factory redesign of the nose landing gear was made available by Dyn'Aéro. Shortly after the accident, Dyn'Aéro published a Service Bulletin to encourage MCR owners to inspect the weld joint between the front leg tube and the <b>wheel</b> <b>bracket.</b> Finally, a nose gear reinforcement part was made available for mandatory installation by April 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Circa 1965, Dutch Mk 5 and 5/2 {{tanks were}} {{equipped}} with infrared headlights, searchlight, and viewing equipment, of Philips design {{instead of the}} types used on British tanks. Around the same time, a [...]50-caliber ranging machine gun was added, as was a spare <b>wheel</b> <b>bracket</b> on {{the rear of the}} turret, and from 1969, the M1919 Browning machine guns were replaced by FN MAGs. From 1973, the tanks’ radio sets were replaced by Philips-designed ones.|$|E
5000|$|Birkby’s Brickworks, small steel wagon with 4 {{flangeless}} <b>wheels</b> and forked <b>bracket</b> {{to accept}} haulage chain. It ran on an 18in gauge plateway made up from lengths of steel angle. Donated 1983.|$|R
50|$|Unimogs were {{developed}} in post-war Germany {{to be used as}} agricultural equipment. The Unimog was designed with equal-sized <b>wheels,</b> a mounting <b>bracket</b> in front, a hitch in the rear, and loading space in the center. This was to make it a multi-purpose vehicle that farmers could use in the field and on the highway.|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} was a rectangular, two-story structure approximately 55 ft by 34 ft, with covered verandas on both floors. Architectural elements included shingled intersecting gabled roofs with gabled ends and fish-scaled shingles painted in various colors. Assorted other details included a scalloped archway, chamfered posts, decorative <b>wheel</b> and quatrefoil <b>brackets,</b> and an entrance gable with a carved bridgeboard. Diamonds and rectangles were also {{incorporated into the}} structure via ornamental lintels and balustrades.|$|R
40|$|In modern {{spacecraft}} {{with the}} requirement of increased accuracy of payloads, the on-orbit structural dynamic behavior of spacecraft is increasingly influencing the design and performance of spacecraft. During the integrated spacecraft testing {{of one of the}} satellites, a strong coupling between rotating momentum wheels and an earth sensor was detected. This resulted in corruption of the earth sensor data at certain wheel speeds. This paper deals with the dynamic coupling problem of a rotating momentum wheel with its support brackets affecting other subsystems of spacecraft. As part of this investigation, extensive modal tests and vibration tests were carried out on the momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>bracket</b> assembly with wheels in stationary and rotating conditions. It was found that the effects of gyroscopic forces arising out of rotating wheels are significant and this aspect needs {{to be taken into account}} while designing the mounting brackets. Results of analysis and tests were used to redesign the bracket leading to a significant reduction in the interaction and associated problems. A procedure for design of a support structure using a low-order mathematical model is also shown...|$|E
5000|$|Custom wheels for lowriders {{also used}} naked ladies on wheel covers {{and these were}} the first to feature a {{floating}} or spinner-type <b>wheel</b> device. A <b>bracket</b> was used to mount to the spindle so while the lady stood still the wheel spun around. Similarly, the Rolls-Royce Phantom has anti-spinners [...] - [...] the [...] "RR" [...] logo {{in the center of the}} hub is mounted on a spinner with an offset weight designed to ensure that the logo is always the right way up when the car is parked.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{extensive}} track use, Mini Cooper GP’s {{are notorious}} for having brake overheating problems. In the conceptual design stages of the car, BMW engineers intended to install brake ducts to prevent overheating, but due to time constraints, the cars were shipped without the ducts they were intended to have. The goal of this project was to design and manufacture a brake duct kit for the Mini Cooper GP. After a conceptual design of the system, make-buy decisions were made for each component. The components to be made were designed using computer-aided drafting, engineering, and manufacturing software. The components manufactured for this project included left and right <b>wheel</b> hub <b>brackets</b> and a pulley bracket. The system was installed and tested to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} newly designed and manufactured brake duct kit. Installation instructions were created for a car owner to expedite the installation process. If the decision to enter production is made, the potential revenue is $ 18, 000. This would, however, require an investment of roughly $ 10, 000, leaving a net profit of approximately $ 8, 000. This assumes that all engineering work is already done and not factored into the expenses...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Independent Drivetrain" [...] (or [...] "IDrive") is a four-bar {{suspension}} system for bicycle crank assemblies, {{the rear wheel}} itself is suspended as single pivot suspension. It was developed by mountain bike suspension designer Jim Busby Jr. and was {{a direct result of}} the limitations encountered with the GT LTS (GT Bicycles' [...] "Links Tuned Suspension) four-bar linkage design used by GT Bicycles from 1993 to 1998. The IDrive attempts to maximize the efficiency of the transmission of energy from the rider to the rear <b>wheel.</b> The bottom <b>bracket</b> is placed eccentric in a bearing within the swingarm, the distance between the center of the bearing and the bottom bracket effectively creating a very short link, and the swingarm itself creating another. A link between bearing shell and frame then completes the four-bar linkage with the bottom bracket on the floating link and the linkage as a whole actuated by movement of the swingarm.|$|R
40|$|The {{trackless}} electric pipe tractor {{system for}} the automated transport of goods is an environmentally friendly, economical and competitive transportation system by which special attention must be paid to road-train stability. The existing instability of high loads despite the centre of gravity being below the pipe centre is avoided, on load containers shifted {{to the outside of}} a curve, said measure permitting the use of the largest possible load containers, by placing the container on a fifth wheel by means of a joint whose three axes intersect at a point in each plane which is attached to a bracket below the pipe centre and fixed to a bogie. The additional pitch instability occurring on the first and last bogie of a train is avoided by placing the load container on a fifth <b>wheel</b> via a <b>bracket</b> fixed to a load container, said bracket being attached to the bogie by means of a joint whose three axes intersect at one point and which is located within the axle base of the bogie and below th e pipe centre...|$|R
