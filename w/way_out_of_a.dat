5|$|Clock Tower (1995) is {{the first}} entry in the series and was {{released}} exclusively in Japan. It was directed by Hifumi Kono and originally released for the Super Famicom. An updated version, titled Clock Tower: The First Fear, was ported to the PlayStation, WonderSwan, and Windows. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, although fan translations exist. The story follows Jennifer Simpson, a young girl searching for a <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mansion in Norway while evading Scissorman.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{director}} Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American {{soldier in}} the film Black Hawk Down (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana's performance in Chopper, did not require him to audition. In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, an elite Delta Force soldier, who fights his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battle in Mogadishu, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began. He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms.|$|E

25|$|Perry {{joined the}} British Army and {{was offered the}} choice of a {{position}} working on chemical warfare or joining the Royal Artillery. He chose artillery, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 5 July 1941. He was posted to Egypt where he arrived in August 1941. Perry's frontline experience in the army was short, as he was captured early in 1942 when his unit was overrun by Rommel's forces as they attempted to slow the German advance from Benghazi. Perry spent the next {{three and a half years}} in various German prisoner-of-war camps, initially in Italy; after the confusion brought by the Italian Armistice, he made his first escape attempt. Breaking through a German cordon he tried to hide his escape by crawling through a wheat field, but was quickly recaptured. Over the next few days he and his fellow prisoners were transported by rail farther north towards German camps. Perry jumped off the moving train at Mantua and made his way on foot to the north of the town. As he approached a bridge, he was recognised by a German guard who had recaptured him only five days earlier in Perry's first escape attempt. Perry was escorted to a commandeered villa in the town and locked in a bathroom until he was able to be transferred again. He spent time in camps in Germany and Silesia before the Russian advance forced his movement west to Brunswick. On the journey he made his third and final escape bid. He and a fellow prisoner cut their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cattle truck and leapt from the moving train. Again he was recaptured, this time by a German patrol. He was then taken to appear before a military court in Hildesheim, where he was court-martialed for damaging a German train, and placed in solitary confinement for a month.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there has}} also been {{critical}} condemnation of the cast performances. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented that Matthew Morrison [...] "couldn't rap his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 98° rehearsal", and Allmusic's Andrew Leahey wrote that Cory Monteith and Dianna Agron [...] "can't sing nearly as well as their co-stars". E! Online's Joal Ryan criticized the show for its [...] "overproduced soundtrack" [...] and complained that many songs rely too heavily on the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune: [...] "For every too-brief moment of Lea Michele sounding raw—and lovely—on a [...] "What a Girl Wants", or Monteith singing a perfectly credible REO Speedwagon in the shower, there's Michele and Monteith sounding like 1990s-era Cher on [...] "No Air", or Monteith sounding like the Monteith XRZ-200 on the out-of-the-shower version of [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling".|$|E
500|$|Air Force Inspector General and Olds' West Point classmate Lt Gen Louis L. Wilson, Jr., sent Olds to Southeast Asia in {{the autumn}} of 1971 to {{determine}} the state of readiness of Air Force pilots. Olds toured USAF bases in Thailand (flying several unauthorized combat missions in the process) and brought back a blunt assessment. Air Force pilots, he reported to the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen John D. Ryan (a former SAC general and bomber pilot often at odds with the tactical fighter community), [...] "...couldn't fight their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wet paper bag," [...] because of a systemic lack of interest by the USAF in air-to-air combat training for fighter crews. He warned that losses would be severe in any resumption of aerial combat. Olds recalled that Ryan expressed surprise at this assessment and reflected his disagreement.|$|E

500|$|In March 1969, Maryland {{athletic}} director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one players told Ward {{that they no}} longer wished to play on the team and accused him of using intimidation tactics that included verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward, and he said:"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it. It was the guys who couldn't fight their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paper bag, guys who sat on the bench and couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak cub newspaper guys who don't know what football's all about...He gets on the campus newspaper {{and all of a sudden}} he's got power he never thought of having." ...|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{has said}} that she is {{interested}} in parts of [...] "angst-ridden women" [...] with strong dispositions masking flaws and insecurities. She connects with [...] "women who are either finding their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> situation, looking for love, having some struggle within love, or questioning the big things in life". She subconsciously finds herself drawn to parts that are in tandem with her personal struggles at certain points in her life. She finds it difficult to detach herself from her roles, saying that [...] "you have to confront your true feelings every single day. And that’s pretty exhausting. Then {{you have to go}} home and make dinner". Even so, she finds it therapeutic to perform. Winslet is known for her willingness to perform nude scenes, having done so in 12 of her films, although she considers its contribution to the narrative before agreeing to it. She believes that these scenes promote a positive body image among women.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E
5000|$|Several enemies {{from the}} {{original}} game also make their appearance as adversaries: the Lizard King, the Phantom Knight, the Giddy Goons, and the Mudmen.

500|$|The {{original}} {{music for}} Eternal Punishment was composed by Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya and Masaki Kurokawa, the composers for Innocent Sin. As with Innocent Sin, Tsuchiya found {{the writing process}} difficult {{for a number of}} reasons. Tsuchiya's favorite piece for the score, which was carried over from Innocent Sin, was [...] "Maya's Theme". The tune has remained popular with the Persona fan base: Tsuchiya has attributed its popularity to the enduring nature of the Persona series as a whole, and compared it to a fashionable item of the time that now requires a [...] "certain courage" [...] to wear in later times. The game's theme song, [...] "Change your Way", was written and sung by British singer-songwriter Elisha La'Verne, and the music was composed by T.Kura. La'Verne wrote the song with the premise of Eternal Punishment in mind, and so she wanted the song to sound positive. For inspiration, she drew on her experiences of walking round London and seeing homeless people who appeared unable to improve their status: the song's theme is that there is always a <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad situation and you can change that situation for the better. The title also stemmed from this concept. Together with Innocent Sin, Eternal Punishment is the one of the first entries in the Megami Tensei series to feature voice acting.|$|E
500|$|Shawn Kellner {{from the}} Chicago Music Magazine praised the costumes and the dancing, while Jodi Duckett from The Morning Call {{felt that the}} [...] "characters that looked like Tibetan monks , the gonging of bells and Madonna {{arriving}} in a gilded cage" [...] made the performance seem [...] "very 'Da Vinci Code' like". Kitty Empire from The Guardian received the usage of guns negatively, saying that Madonna's son Rocco would be [...] "perfectly blasé {{about the prospect of}} the former Mrs. Ritchie shooting her <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> confessional booth with a machine gun, as she does on the set opener". Barry Walters from MuuMuse called the opening sequence as [...] "manic" [...] and called it a [...] "power punch" [...] sequence along with [...] "Revolver". Barbara Vandenburgh from The Arizona Republic called the performance as [...] "raucous". Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter was confused as how the religious iconography portrayed during the performance was tied to the song's theme of a [...] "girl gone wild". San Jose Mercury News editor Jim Harrington called the selection of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] as [...] "commonplace". Jim Farber from New York Daily News described the performance as transitioning from a girl gone wild to [...] "girl gone bloodthirsty" [...] with the subsequent violence depictions. Ben Crandell from Florida's Sun-Sentinel newspaper observed that Madonna turned around the [...] "solemn" [...] introduction to a dance number with [...] "Girl Gone Wild". According to her the performance portrayed Madonna as [...] "fashionable, powerful, but vulnerable sex toy", which became [...] "an ongoing theme for the night".|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, John, having just chewed his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dog carrier, meets Apu, who exclaims [...] "Elton John!", to which John replies [...] "That's my name! Well, not really." [...] The {{exchange}} references John's name change, as his birth name was Reginald Dwight. At {{the end of the}} episode, John performs for Apu and Manjula {{on the roof of the}} Kwik-E-Mart. The scene is a callback to the season 7 episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", in which Paul McCartney performed on the roof. The scene in which Homer is seen jamming Valentine's Day cards into their holders were based on an observation by the writers. Simpsons writer George Meyer said of the scene: [...] "You just see cards get really man-handled, and the envelopes get switched with the wrong sizes." [...] In another scene, Marge and Manjula are seen playing badminton. While the scene was conceived in order to provide exposition, the sport was included because badminton is [...] "very popular" [...] in India, according to Simpsons writer Ian Maxtone-Graham. The episode also mentions the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. In a scene, Apu, carrying a shopping bag, exits the jewellery and silverware store Tiffany & Co. Meanwhile, Homer, along with Chief Wiggum, Moe, Flanders and Dr Hibbert are watching Apu, assuming he bought jewellery for Manjula. It is soon revealed that Apu bought a croissant in the store, to which Wiggum says [...] "Oh, that's right, they have breakfast at Tiffany's now." [...] The heart-shaped fade out at the end of the episode is a reference to the series Love, American Style.|$|E
5000|$|In Carl Jung's {{theory of}} the ego, {{described}} in 1916 in Psychological Types, intuition is an [...] "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the [...] "rational functions" [...] of thinking and feeling.

Likewise, religion scholar Anthony Hoekema stated that the doctrine was [...] "simply <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> embarrassing predicament" [...] and therefore [...] "a doctrine built on a mistake".
