25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{electricity}} meter is the electromechanical induction <b>watt-hour</b> meter.|$|E
25|$|The first {{specimen}} of the AC kilowatt-hour meter produced {{on the basis}} of Hungarian Ottó Bláthy's patent and named after him was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction kilowatt-hour meter was already marketed by the factory {{at the end of the}} same year. These were the first alternating-current <b>watt-hour</b> meters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters. The AC kilowatt hour meters used at present operate on the same principle as Bláthy's original invention.|$|E
25|$|The device {{featured}} a small 1.55inch multi-touch screen {{with a lower}} resolution of 240×240 pixels but a higher pixel density of 220 pixels per inch, as opposed to the larger 2.2inch screen on the fifth-generation iPod Nano. The device had a 0.39 <b>watt-hour</b> battery rated at 3.7 volts, giving a capacity of 105 mAh, and specified to give 24 hours of music playback on a single full charge. The device took about three hours for one full charge. The device retained the same 30-pin dock connector as previous generations. This Nano lost the previous generation's video camera, built-in voice recorder microphone (although plugging in headphones with a built in microphone revealed a Voice Memos app) and built-in speaker, and games. It also lost support for video playback, but music videos and video podcasts (vodcasts) could be synced onto the device, and the audio from them would play on the device, with a single key-frame shown on the screen. It still included the Nike+iPod fitness option as well as an FM radio tuner with RDS (Radio Data System). It had a black on white screen contrast option and other accessibility options. The 6th generation iPod Nano had the same price point as the 5th generation device.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{estimate}} that a methanogenic digester coupled to a nitrification-anammox bioreactor could generate 24 <b>watt-hours</b> {{per person per}} day, a net swing of 70 <b>watt-hours.</b>|$|R
25|$|Examples of <b>watt-hours</b> per sol {{collected}} by the rover. The rover uses combination of solar cells and a rechargeable chemical battery. This class of rover has two rechargeable lithium batteries with 8 amp-hour capacity. At {{the start of the}} mission the solar panels could provide up to around 900 <b>watt-hours</b> to recharge the battery and power system in one Sol, but this can vary due to a variety of factors. In Eagle crater the cells were producing about 840 <b>watt-hours,</b> but by Sol 319 in December 2004, it had dropped to 730 <b>watt-hours.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electricity {{came from}} 1500 <b>watt-hours</b> stored in {{chemical}} batteries.|$|R
2500|$|Also around 1889, Elihu Thomson of the [...] American General Electric company {{developed}} a [...] recording watt meter (<b>watt-hour</b> meter) {{based on an}} ironless commutator motor. This meter overcame the disadvantages of the electrochemical type and could operate on either alternating or direct current.|$|E
2500|$|In 1894 Oliver Shallenberger of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation {{applied the}} {{induction}} principle previously used [...] only in AC ampere-hour meters {{to produce a}} <b>watt-hour</b> meter of the modern electromechanical form, using an induction disk whose rotational speed was made proportional to the power in the circuit. The Bláthy meter was similar to Shallenberger and Thomson meter {{in that they are}} two-phase motor meter. Although the induction meter would only work on alternating current, it eliminated the delicate and troublesome commutator of the Thomson design. Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.|$|E
2500|$|In a Marchant, {{near the}} {{beginning}} of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward [...] "into the dip", away from the openings in the cover. They engaged drive gears {{in the body of the}} machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional <b>watt-hour</b> meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead disc cam realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its (20-digit) accumulator!).|$|E
50|$|It {{was thought}} {{that by the end}} of the 90-sol mission, the {{capability}} of the solar arrays to generate power would likely be reduced to about 50 watts. This was due to anticipated dust coverage on the solar arrays, and the change in season. Over three Earth years later, however, the rovers power supplies hovered between 300 <b>watt-hours</b> and 900 <b>watt-hours</b> per day, depending on dust coverage. Cleaning events (dust removal by wind) have occurred more often than NASA expected, keeping the arrays relatively free of dust and extending the life of the mission. During a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, both rovers experienced some of the lowest power of the mission; Opportunity dipped to 128 <b>watt-hours.</b> In November 2008, Spirit had overtaken this low-energy record with a production of 89 <b>watt-hours,</b> due to dust storms in the region of Gusev crater.|$|R
50|$|Normally {{the solar}} arrays {{are able to}} {{generate}} about 700 <b>watt-hours</b> of energy per day. During the storms, the power generated is greatly reduced. If the rovers get less than 150 <b>watt-hours</b> per day they have to start draining their batteries. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. On July 18, 2007, the rover's solar-panel only generated 128 <b>watt-hours,</b> the lowest level ever. NASA responded by commanding Opportunity to only communicate with Earth once every three days, {{the first time that}} this had happened {{since the start of the}} mission.|$|R

5000|$|A small dust {{cleaning}} event {{occurred on}} Sol 3175 (Dec. 29, 2012), improving the energy production by about 40 <b>watt-hours</b> per sol. As of Sol 3180 (Jan. 3, 2013), the solar array energy production was 542 <b>watt-hours</b> with an atmospheric opacity (Tau) of 0.961 and an improved solar array dust factor of 0.633. NASA ...|$|R

5000|$|Opportunity spent roughly 180 sols {{inside the}} crater, before {{backing out of}} it again in mid December 2004, on Sol 315. Scientific results of the {{sedimentary}} geology of the crater {{were published in the}} journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters [...] In December 2004, daily power output varied from 840 <b>watt-hours</b> while inside Endurance Crater to 730 <b>watt-hours</b> on the plains.|$|R
50|$|In January, it was {{suspected}} that some units were shipping with 24 <b>watt-hour</b> capacity batteries, labeled as 32 <b>watt-hour.</b> The low-capacity batteries {{appear to be}} those manufactured in Tokyo. It was later determined that the software {{used to examine the}} batteries was incorrectly reporting the capacity and has since been reported to be fixed with an upgrade of the BIOS.|$|E
50|$|The power {{subsystem}} comprises two batteries: a non-rechargeable primary 1000 <b>watt-hour</b> battery {{to provide}} {{power for the}} first 60 hours and a secondary 140 <b>watt-hour</b> battery recharged by the solar panels to be used after the primary is exhausted. The solar panels cover 2.2 m2 and were designed to deliver up to 32 watts {{at a distance of}} 3 AU from the Sun.|$|E

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{cleaning}} events beginning on Sol [...] (April 20, 2007) allowed Opportunitys {{solar energy production}} to rise to above 800 <b>watt-hours</b> per Sol. By Sol [...] (May 4, 2007) the solar array current was peaking above 4.0 amperes, values not seen since Sol [...] (February 10, 2004). However, the advent of extensive dust storms on Mars starting in mid-2007 (in-line with Mars' six Earth-year global dust storm cycle), dropped energy production levels to 280 <b>watt-hours</b> per day.|$|R

50|$|The {{sum of the}} {{molecular}} masses of the reactants is 642.6 g/mol, so theoretically a cell can produce two faradays of charge (192,971 coulombs) from 642.6 g of reactants, or 83.4 ampere-hours per kilogram (or 13.9 ampere-hours per kilogram for a 12-volt battery). For a 2 volts cell, this comes to 167 <b>watt-hours</b> per kilogram of reactants, but a lead-acid cell in practice gives only 30-40 <b>watt-hours</b> per kilogram of battery, due to {{the mass of the}} water and other constituent parts.|$|R
5000|$|In September, {{numerous}} {{surface targets}} and rocks around Solander were {{examined by the}} rover. Solar array energy production dropped to 346 <b>watt-hours</b> by Sol 3430 (September 16, 2013), and 325 <b>watt-hours</b> by Sol 3452 (October 9, 2013). By traveling to locations with favorable tilt, dubbed [...] "lily pads", Opportunity managed to receive over about 300 <b>watt-hours</b> per day even as {{the heart of the}} Mars winter approached. The Martian winter minimum is predicted for February 2014, but by making use of the northward slopes it was expected the rover would have enough power to remain mobile during the Martian winter. By the end of October the rover was climbing up Solander point, where it was hoped some of the oldest rocks yet seen would be examined. The rocks were believed to date to Mars's Noachian Period about four billion years ago, and could have provided some science surprises by Christmas. The team was hunting for [...] "juicy" [...] slopes of 5 to 20 degrees for more power. As it ascended, it doglegged in early November to avoid an area of dusty ripples. It continued to collect data on Martian rocks and dust in the area. Total odometry by November 5, 2013 (or in Mars days since the landing, Sol 3478) was 38.53 km. Energy production from the Sun on that date was 311 <b>watt-hours,</b> with Tau at 0.536 and the dust factor at 0.491.Before Spirit rover stopped responding in 2010, it reported 134 <b>watt-hours</b> as temperatures plunged below minus 41.5 degrees Celsius (minus 42.7 degrees Fahrenheit).|$|R

Orientation and attitude control about three axes was enabled by twelve nitrogen gas jets coupled {{to a system of}} three gyros, four primary Sun sensors, two secondary Sun sensors, and an Earth sensor. Power was supplied by 9,792 silicon solar cells contained in the two solar panels, giving a total array area of 2.3 square meters and producing 200 W. Two 1200 <b>watt-hour</b> AgZnO batteries rated at 26.5 V with a capacity for 9 hours of operation provided power to each of the separate communication/TV camera chains.
