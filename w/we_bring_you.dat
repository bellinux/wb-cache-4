Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine commented that the video was [...] "sexy" [...] and that [...] "Beyoncé pops it back for a mysterious detective." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that Beyoncé dances [...] "seductively" [...] in the office. Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine wrote: [...] "To anyone who finds Beyoncé attractive or has ever wanted her to dance for them, <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> her latest video. The visuals for 'Dance for You' {{are more or less}} a chance for her to show off why so many of you think her husband, Jay-Z, is the luckiest man alive." [...] Leah Collins of Canadian magazine Dose wrote, [...] "It's all very sultry and intimate to a point—that point being the moment she unveils a line-up of back-up dancers." [...] Similarly, a writer of the website Idolator commented, [...] "'Dance for You' doesn't compare to the spectacle of say, the 'Run the World (Girls)' clip, but it is effective. [...] It's a mostly private dance—until all those other ladies show up." [...] The writer also called Beyoncé a femme fatale in the video. Likewise, Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post wrote that Beyoncé [...] "goes full on femme fatale" [...] and concluded that the concept of the video [...] "is about as straightforward as can be". Marc Hogan of Spin magazine noted, [...] "The video follows pretty literally from the song's theme, with Mrs. Jay-Z grinding sensuously." [...] A writer of Vibe magazine noted that Beyoncé was [...] "keeping things sexy" [...] with the video for the song.|$|E

60|$|I {{have shown}} the impossibility of the Company's having {{intended}} to authorize such a revenue, much less such a constitution of it as Mr. Hastings has drawn from the very prohibitions of bribery, and such an exchequer as he has formed upon the principles I have stated. You will not dishonor the legislature or the Company, be it what it may, by thinking that either of them could give any sanction to it. Indeed, you will not think that such a device could ever enter into the head of any rational man. You are, then, to judge whether {{it is not a}} device to cover guilt, to prevent detection by destroying the means of it; {{and at the same time}} your Lordships will judge whether the evidence <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to prove that revenue is a mere pretext be not stronger than the strange, absurd reasons which he has produced for forming this new plan of an exchequer of bribery.|$|E

60|$|Moses {{had given}} way to the very temptation which would beset such a man. He had spoken unadvisedly with his lips, and said, 'Hear now, ye rebels, or ye fools, must <b>WE</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> water out of this rock?' WE, and not God. He had claimed for himself the power and glory of working miracles. The miracles, he thought for a moment, were his, and not God's. And it may be that this was not the only time that he had so sinned. He may {{naturally}} have thought that he had some special power and influence with God. But be that as it may, the Jews were trained to believe that the miracles were God's, God's immediate work, and not performed by the wisdom or sanctity or supernatural power of any saint or prophet whatsoever. Let the Jews once learn to give the honour and glory to Moses, and not to God, and the whole of their strange education went for nothing. Instead of worshipping God they would begin to worship saints. Instead of trusting in God, they would begin to trust in men; whether on earth or in heaven matters not. If Moses was to have the honour and glory, the Jews would surely grow into a superstitious, saint- worshipping, miracle-mongering people, and come to ruin and slavery thereby. They were to fear God and nought else. To trust in God and nought else.|$|E
