25|$|The {{marine and}} estuarine {{areas in the}} Kaipara Harbour breed snapper, mullet, flounder, sole, kahawai, <b>white</b> <b>trevally,</b> gurnard, yellow‑eyed mullet and skates, rays and sharks. The Kaipara is the largest estuarine harbour {{on the west coast}} of New Zealand and {{provides}} significant areas of suitable breeding grounds and habitats for juvenile fish. It has fewer problems with water quality than the Manukau, and is the single most significant wetland for west coast fisheries.|$|E
25|$|In Māori mythology, the ocean-going canoe Māhuhu voyaged from Hawaiki to New Zealand and {{overturned}} on {{the northern}} side of the entrance. It was commanded by the chief Rongomai, who drowned. His body was eaten by araara (<b>white</b> <b>trevally),</b> and his descendants to this day will not eat that type of fish. The first European shipwreck was the Aurora, a 550-ton barque, in 1840, {{and the most recent}} was the yacht Aosky in 1994. Today, the remains of wrecks still become visible under certain tidal and sand conditions. The Kaipara is rarely used today for shipping, and no large settlements lie close to its shores, although many small communities lie along its coastline.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the <b>white</b> <b>trevally).</b> The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E

50|$|The whitefin {{trevally}} is a benthic predator, {{taking a}} variety of small fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods, either by foraging or chasing down its prey using its eyes which are extremely well adapted to the deep, low-light waters. Along with the <b>white</b> <b>trevally,</b> Pseudocaranx dentex, {{it is the only}} member of the Carangidae to have the anatomy of its eyes examined, with the study finding excellent dark-environment sight due to the presence of a tapetum.|$|E

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>trevally,</b> Pseudocaranx dentex, (also {{known as}} striped jack) is a jack {{of the family}} Carangidae {{widespread}} in tropical and warm temperate areas between 40°N and 47°S, in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Indian and Pacific Oceans. It has a deep body, and a greenish colour with metallic overtones and a dark spot above the gills. The fins are yellow. Trevally are strong fighters and the flesh is good to eat if a little dry. It is often used as cut baits. Maximum size is about 120 cm.|$|E

50|$|Relatively {{long-lived}} fish, Australian salmon are a favoured {{target of}} recreational fishers, and both commercial and traditional Māori fisheries. They are also common bycatch of the Australasian snapper (Pagrus auratus), mullet (Mugilidae), <b>white</b> <b>trevally</b> (Pseudocaranx dentex), and mackerel (Scombridae) fisheries. These species are all taken {{in great numbers}} by way of purse seine nets and trawling. They are also caught by skilled fishermen along the southern coastline of Australia by beach seining. Due to declining numbers and ever-increasing annual catch sizes, the future viability of the Australian salmon stock has been put into question.|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{biology and}} habitat {{preferences}} of the <b>white</b> <b>trevally,</b> Pseudocaranx dentex (Carangidae), were studied in the Azores islands, central north Atlantic, to determine the spatial and seasonal dynamics of habitat use of immature and mature fish. The sex ratio was close to 1 : 1 and fish matured at about 30 cm fork length. There were no differences in the maturation or length-weight relationships between sexes. The spawning season lasts from June to September. Underwater visual censuses showed that schools of mature individuals preferentially aggregate around the summits of offshore reefs during the spawning season. In contrast, schools of smaller, immature fish use inshore habitats all year round. Our data {{support the hypothesis that}} offshore reefs are a preferential spawning habitat of larger <b>white</b> <b>trevally,</b> and most possibly for a number of visitor pelagic predators as well. Inverse relationships between exploitation levels, abundance and size composition at the two different islands suggest that the summer fishery targeting trevally schools around offshore reefs has negatively impacted the population. These findings bring additional ecological and management relevance to offshore reefs...|$|E
40|$|Specimens of {{the three}} new fish species were {{recorded}} during 2015 and 2016 in the River Neretva Estuary. These species are: <b>White</b> <b>trevally,</b> Pseudocaranx dentex (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), Pilotfish, Naucrates ductor (Linnaeus, 1758) and White grouper, Epinephelus aeneus (Geoffroy Saint–Hilaire, 1817). The characteristics of caught specimens and their history of records in Adriatic Sea are described. Potential impact of new species invasion in the Neretva Estuary as a major Eastern Adriatic nursery habitat is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Fish are {{attracted}} to floating structures, including coastal cage fish farms, sometimes in dense aggregations. To understand better the influence of aquaculture on wild fish stocks, we carried out samplings by fishing bait and trammel netting around two Eastern Mediterranean farms. A total number of 54 individuals belonging to 12 species were captured. Striped mullet, salema and <b>white</b> <b>trevally</b> were the species that consumed pellets in great quantity. The results of this preliminary study indicates that feeding behavior of wild fish around fish cages can have important ecological consequences on reducing the environmental effects of aquaculture in Pagasitikos gulf...|$|E
30|$|For n- 3 and n- 6 PUFAs, {{the highest}} content {{was found for}} Atlantic salmon and grey mullet {{at the level of}} 2, 900 and 1, 980  mg per 100  g, respectively. Regarding EPA, DHA, and DPA, fatty acids that need to be intake from food, the total amount varied from 31.3 to 2, 510  mg per 100  g. No matter whether the {{individual}} or sum of these n- 3 fatty acids is concerned, the highest amount was found in Atlantic salmon. While Japanese eel, laced moray, grunt, yellow croaker, silver pomfret, false halibut, <b>white</b> <b>trevally,</b> purple amberjack, and yellowtail kingfish from region B were also found to contain more than 1, 000  mg per 100  g of these n- 3 fatty acids.

40|$|In 1999, disease {{outbreaks}} in juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua {{that showed the}} classic signs of viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) were reported in Nova Scotia. Brain and retinal tissues from moribund cod showed diffuse degenerative vacuolative encephalopathy and degenerative histiocytic retinitis. The affected brain and retinal tissues were observed to be positive for nodaviral antigens by means of immunohistochemical techniques. We partially characterized a nodavirus-like agent from brain and eye tissues and cell culture using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and primer sets originally designed for amplification of <b>white</b> <b>trevally</b> Caranx dentex (also known as striped jack Pseudocaranx dentex) and Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus nervous necrosis virus coat (capsid) proteins. Sequencing of the T 2 region of the coat protein revealed high similarities (> 85 % nucleotide identity) to the coat protein genes of other fish nodavirus strains, especially those of Atlantic halibut and barfin flounder Verasper moseri, which possessed 92 % nucleotide identity. Based upon the sequence of its T 4 region, this nodavirus {{is a member of}} the barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus clade.

40|$|A {{survey of}} 79 fish species {{revealed}} 16 species of Colobomatus of which 11 are new and described below. The first ten new species were from Australian {{fish and the}} eleventh from a South African fish. The following species are described: Colobomatus cresseyi n. sp. from the eastern river garfish Hyporhamphus regularis ardelio (Whitley) and the snub-nosed garfish Arrhamphus sclerolepis krefftii (Stein-dachner); C. nanus n. sp. from the trumpeter Pelates quadrilineatus (Bloch); C. lesteri n. sp. from the common silver-belly Gerres ovatus (Günther); C. sewelli n. sp. from the seven-fingers tassel-fish Polynemus heptadactylus Cuvier; C. hispidus n. sp. from the blotched javelin-fish Pomadasys maculatus (Bloch); C. ornatus n. sp. from the whiptail Pentapodus setosus (Cuvier & Valenciennes); C. cribbi n. sp. from the barred-faced spine-cheek Scolopsis taeniopterus (Kuhl & van Hasselt); C. rothae n. sp. from the dusky flathead Platycephalus fuscus (Cuvier & Valenciennes) and the bar-tailed flathead P. indicus (L.); C. gietzelae n. sp. from the thread-fin silver-belly Gerres punctatus (Cuvier & Valenciennes); C. creeveyae n. sp. from the <b>white</b> <b>trevally</b> Pseudocarynx dentex (Bloch & Schneider); and C. mackayi n. sp. from an African haemulid, Pomadasys striatus (Gilchrist & Thompson). Colobomatus mylionus Fukui, 1965, is redescribed from the silver bream Acanthopagrus australis (Günther). Details of the mouthparts of C. kyphosus Sekerak, 1970, are given for the first time. This is a relatively plesiomorphic member of the genus (West, unpublished data), and its morphology assists {{in the interpretation of}} the appendages of the Australian species. Revised diagnoses for the family Philichthyidae Vogt and the genus Colobomatus hesse, 1873 are given. These incorporate the genus Colobomatoides Essafi & Raibaut, 1980 and the new Colobomatus species described herein respectively...|$|E
