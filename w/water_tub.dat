40|$|Abstract: Explosion {{suppression}} {{and isolation}} apparatus {{act as the}} last barrier to minimize casualties and property loss. Regrettably, the present techniques, such as <b>water</b> <b>tubs</b> and dust barriers, cannot effectively suppress multiple and continuous explosions. Being a porous medium, foam ceramics are characterized with large porosity and strong resistance against high temperature and shocks. Theoretical analysis and experimental study suggest that, due to numerous collisions with the walls in foam ceramics, the free radicals –generated in the chemical reactions of gas combustion and responsible for flame propagation, can be significantly destroyed, the reactive heat release be restrained, thus making the chemical reactions non-self-sustained. As a result, flame propagation is quenched. Furthermore, foam ceramics can markedly attenuate shock waves. Thus, if properly designed and arranged in the roadways, the material is expected to become a new-generation gas explosion suppression and isolation method in coal mines...|$|R

40|$|In 1953 DNA was {{discovered}} and the Everest was conquered {{but also a}} great invention was developed: the heart-lung machine, which allowed the treatment, and in many cases, the cure of most cardiovascular illnesses. In fact, on May 6, 1953 John Gibbon crowned with success {{the work of his}} entire life closing for the first time an atrial septal defect in a young woman using a heart-lung machine of his own invention. Before that, surgeons had explored other roads like hypothermia, cooling the patient in a cold <b>water</b> <b>tub</b> and then rapidly performing the surgical correction of a heart malformation. After his first success, the following 4 patients of Gibbon died, which led him to abandon heart surgery and produced a generalized pessimism about extracorporeal circulation. However, a year later Walton Lillehei reverted this situation with the introduction of controlled cross-circulation in which a patient, usually a child, was connected to a "donor", usually his father or mother, whose heart and lung served as a pump and oxigenator, allowing the performance of open heart surgery. Finally, it was Lillehei again who a year later introduced the bubble oxigenator, simple and inexpensive, opening the doors of open heart surgery to all surgeons around the world. For this, and many other reasons, Walton Lillehei is considered by most surgeons as the "Father of Open Heart Surgery". Lillehei visited Chile in 1963 and operated on a patient in the surgical theaters of the Hospital Clínico de la Universidad Católica and was named an Honorary Member of the School of Medicine of this University. Before that, in 1957 Helmut Jaeger at the Hospital Luis Calvo Mackenna performed the first successful surgical closure of an atrial septal defect with extracorporeal circulation in Chile using a De Wall-Lillehei bubble oxigenator (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 1337 - 44...|$|E

Water samples were collected from macrophytes natural habitat and <b>water</b> <b>tubs</b> used for growing E. crassipes and analysed along with plant tissues for Cu content. The work also characterized the associated microbiota of the rhizosphere system of the E. crassipes as well as the wetland system of its occurrence. Copper concentration of the wetland water samples ranged from 0. 009 to 0. 03 ppm. Six bacterial genera (Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Bacillus, Kurthia, Listeria and Chromobacterium) were represented in rhizosphere of E. crassipes and 4 bacterial genera (Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Listeria and Chromobacterium) were recorded in wetland water samples. Copper resistance studies of the bacterial isolates showed that out of 26 isolates from rhizosphere and 19 strains from water samples, 12 of them showed low resistance (80 %) of copper during 15 days experiment. Copper accumulation was found to be high in the root followed by leaf and petiole. Results of the present study concluded that E. crassipes is an efficient plant {{for the removal of}} copper...|$|R

40|$|Countermeasures to {{biofouling}} in simulated ocean {{thermal energy}} conversion heat exchangers have been studied in single-pass flow systems, using cold deep and warm surface ocean waters off the island of Hawaii. Manual brushing of the loops after free fouling periods removed most of the biofouling material. However, over a 2 -year period a tenacious film formed. Daily free passage of sponge rubber balls through the tubing only removed the loose surface biofouling layer and was inadequate as a countermeasure in both titanium and aluminum alloy tubes. Chlorination at 0. 05, 0. 07, and 0. 10 mg liter- 1 for 1 h day- 1 lowered biofouling rates. Only at 0. 10 mg liter- 1 was chlorine adequate over a 1 -year period to keep film formation and heat transfer resistance from rising above the maximum tolerated values. Lower chlorination regimens led to the buildup of uneven or patchy films which produced increased flow turbulence. The result was lower heat transfer resistance values which did not correlate {{with the amount of}} biofouling. Surfaces which were let foul and then treated with intermittent or continuous chlorination at 0. 10 mg of chlorine or less per liter were only partially or unevenly cleaned, although heat transfer measurements did not indicate that fact. It took continuous chlorination at 0. 25 mg liter- 1 to bring the heat transfer resistance to zero and eliminate the fouling layer. Biofouling in deep cold seawater was much slower than in the warm surface <b>waters.</b> <b>Tubing</b> in one stainless-steel loop had a barely detectable fouling layer after 1 year in flow. With aluminum alloys sufficient corrosion and biofouling material accumulated to require that some fouling coutermeasure be used in long-term operation of an {{ocean thermal energy}} conversion plant...|$|R
