50|$|Despite showing little {{aptitude}} {{behind the}} wheel while training for his road licence, Hartmann {{went on to become}} one of Hungary's leading competition drivers of the pre-World War II period. He began his racing career in the late 1920s, driving his own privately entered Hupmobile in local circuit and hillclimb events. He soon graduated to a true racing car, buying a Bugatti Type 35B from compatriot Count Tivadar Zichy in 1929. <b>With</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> of his own Bugattis - a Type 37A sports car bought in 1930 - he began to enter more prestigious and challenging European events in addition to those in his home country. Hartmann regularly featured in the top five finishers at most European hillclimb events in the following few years, and in 1930 he took second place overall in the European Mountain Championship series. His performances caught the Bugatti factory's eye and they occasionally lent him a more powerful Type 51, with which he won the hillclimb events at Guggenberg in 1932 and 1933. In addition to racing against the clock Hartmann also participated in a number of Grand Prix circuit races during this period, never failing to finish in the top 10 when mechanical maladies or accidents didn't prevent him from finishing at all.|$|E
40|$|Nearly 50 {{million people}} {{worldwide}} suffer from age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which causes severe loss of central vision. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in {{the gene for}} the complement regulator factor H (FH), which causes a Tyr-to-His substitution at position 402, is linked to ∼ 50 % of attributable risks for AMD. We present the crystal structure of the region of FH containing the polymorphic amino acid His 402 in complex with an analogue of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that localize the complement regulator on the cell surface. The structure demonstrates direct coordination of ligand by the disease-associated polymorphic residue, providing a molecular explanation of the genetic observation. This glycan-binding site occupies {{the center of an}} extended interaction groove on the regulator's surface, implying multivalent binding of sulfated GAGs. This finding is confirmed by structure-based site-directed mutagenesis, nuclear magnetic resonance–monitored binding experiments performed for both H 402 and Y 402 variants <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> model GAG, and analysis of an extended GAG–FH complex...|$|E
40|$|The obtaining of {{commercial}} cultivars of potato with {{resistance to the}} phytopatogen is a very promising alternative that the genetic engineering can provide, through the introduction of exogenous genes for the genetic transformation. In order to establish an efficient system of transformation, it is crucial first to optimize in vitro organogenesis protocol. This work aimed to establish an efficient protocol for the genetic transformation of potato cv. Atlantic. The efficiency of the in vitro organogenesis {{is influenced by the}} explant type and by the kind and concentrations of growth regulators used. Shoot segments of potato cv. Atlantic present better organogenesis capacity than leaf explants. It is recommended to use the woody plant medium (WPM) supplied with 1, 0 mg L- 1 of naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) + 5, 0 mg L- 1 of zeatin riboside (ZEA), to obtain shoots from shoot segments, and the carbenicilin (Cb) added to this medium increased this formation. For the process to enlarge shoots, this same antibiotic when added to the WPM medium in growing concentrations (100; 250; 500 mg L- 1) promoted a decrease in the height of plants, number of shoots and length of roots. After the co-cultivation of shoots segments with Agrobacterium tumefaciens these concentrations of Cb are not efficient in the elimination of the bacteria, which commits the organogenesis. However, it is possible to establish a protocol of in vitro organogenesis of potato cv. Atlantic starting from shoots segments not co-cultivated. These results will be useful for futures experiments of genetic transformation <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> commercials cultivars of potato. A obtenção de cultivares comerciais de batata com resistência a fitopatógenos é uma alternativa muito promissora que a engenharia genética pode proporcionar, através da introdução de genes exógenos visando transformação genética. Para tal, torna-se imprescindível estabelecer um sistema eficiente de transformação, e neste sentido a determinação de um protocolo de organogênese in vitro é o passo fundamental para este processo. Objetivou-se determinar um protocolo eficiente para a transformação genética de batata cv. Atlantic. A eficiência da organogênese in vitro é influenciada pelo tipo de explante e pelo tipo e concentrações de reguladores de crescimento utilizados. Segmentos internodais de batata cv. Atlantic apresentam melhor capacidade organogenética que explantes foliares. Recomenda-se utilizar o meio woody plant medium (WPM) suplementado com 1, 0 mg L- 1 de ácido naftaleno-acético (ANA) + 5, 0 mg L- 1 de zeatina ribosídeo (ZEA), para se obter brotações em segmentos internodais, sendo que a carbenicilina (Cb) adicionada a este meio potencializa esta formação. Para o processo de alongamento de brotos, este mesmo antibiótico quando adicionado ao meio WPM em concentrações crescentes (100; 250; 500 mg L- 1) promove uma diminuição na altura de plantas, número de nós e comprimento radicular. Após o co-cultivo de segmentos internodais com Agrobacterium tumefaciens estas concentrações de Cb não são eficientes na eliminação da bactéria, o que compromete a organogênese. No entanto, é possível estabelecer um protocolo de organogênese in vitro de batata cv. Atlantic a partir de segmentos internodais não co-cultivados.

40|$|A rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant {{displaying}} {{defects in}} panicle development was identified among transformants in a transgenic mutagenized experiment using an antisense cDNA library prepared from young rice panicles. In the mutant, the average spikelet number {{was reduced to}} 59. 8 compared with 104. 3 in wild-type plants. In addition, the seed-setting rate of the mutant was low (39. 3 %) owing to abnormal female development. Genetic analysis of T 1 and T 2 progeny showed that the traits segregated in a 3 (mutant) : 1 (wild type) ratio and the mutation was cosegregated with the transgene. Southern blot and thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the mutant had a single T-DNA insertion on chromosome 5, where no gene was tagged.

40|$|We {{show that}} the in vivo {{generation}} of cytokine-producing CD 4 T cells specific for a given major histocompatibility class-II (MHCII) -binding peptide of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) is facilitated when mice are immunized with splenic antigen presenting cells (APC) pulsed <b>with</b> <b>this</b> HEL peptide <b>and</b> <b>another</b> peptide that binds a different MHCII molecule. This enhanced generation of peptide-specific effector CD 4 T cells requires that the same splenic APC be pulsed with both peptides. Pulsed B cells, but not pulsed dendritic cells (DCs), can mediate CD 4 T cell cooperation, which can be blocked by disrupting OX 40 -OX 40 L (CD 134 -CD 252) interactions. In addition, the generation of HEL peptide-specific CD 4 T cell memory is greater when mice are primed with B cells pulsed with the two peptides than with B cells pulsed with the HEL- peptide alone. Based on our findings, we suggest CD 4 T cell cooperation is important for vaccine design, underlies the phenomenon of "epitope-spreading" seen in autoimmunity, and that the efficacy of B cell-depletion {{in the treatment of}} human cell-mediated autoimmune disease is due to the abrogation of the interactions between autoimmune CD 4 T cells that facilitates their activation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Gene {{therapy and}} viral therapy for cancer have {{therapeutic}} effects, {{but there has}} been no significant breakthrough in these two forms of therapy. Therefore, a new strategy called “targeting gene-virotherapy”, which combines the advantages of gene therapy and viral therapy, has been formulated. This new therapy has stronger antitumor effects than either gene therapy or viral therapy. A tumor-specific repli-cative adenovirus vector ZD 55 (E 1 B 55 KD deleted Adv.) was constructed and various single therapeutic genes were inserted into ZD 55 to form ZD 55 -gene. These are the targeting gene-virotherapy genes. But experiments showed that a single gene was not effective in eliminating the tumor mass, and therefore two genes were separately inserted into ZD 55. This strategy is called “targeting dual gene-virotherapy ” (with PCT patent). Better results were obtained <b>with</b> <b>this</b> strategy, <b>and</b> all the xenograft tumor masses were com-pletely eliminated in all mice when two suitable genes producing a synergetic or compensative effect were chosen. Twenty-six papers on these strategies have been published by researchers in our laboratory. Furthermore, an adenoviral vector with two targeting promoters harboring two antitumor genes has been constructed for cancer therapy. Promising results have been obtained <b>with</b> <b>this</b> adenoviral vector <b>and</b> <b>another</b> patent has been applied for. This antitumor strategy can be used to kill tumor cells completely with minimum damage to normal cells. Key words cancer; therapy; gene; targeting viral vector; targeting gene-viru...|$|R
