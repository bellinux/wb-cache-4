The song's title was a saying from {{a friend of the}} band.

[...] "If It Means a Lot to You" [...] had been written {{over the course of a}} year, and McKinnon said he wrote it about himself. McKinnon described the song as a [...] "great way to end" [...] the album, describing it as one of their [...] "biggest songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friedgen {{was born}} on April 4, 1947 in Harrison, New York. His father, [...] "Big Ralph" [...] Friedgen, {{attended}} Fordham University, where he played from 1938 to 1939, and coached high school football for 30years. The younger Friedgen worked under his father as a water boy and manager, and the two often attended New York Giants and Jets games together. He attended Harrison High School where he played quarterback on his father's team. John Nugent, the head coach of Harrison's rival Rye High School, recommended that his brother, Maryland head coach Tom Nugent, recruit Friedgen. His recruitment was handled by Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at the school. After his first season at Maryland, Nugent was fired as head coach, and his successor Lou Saban moved Friedgen to fullback to fill in for an injured teammate. The following year, Maryland had a new coach, and Bob Ward again changed Friedgen's position, this time to offensive guard, although he had never blocked before. Upset about the constant turnover at head coach and position changes, Friedgen received a favorable recommendation to transfer from coach Ward, but his father said, [...] "You can transfer, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> the key you have {{is not going to}} fit the door because we're changing the lock. Quitters don't live here." [...] He remained at Maryland as a guard and later said the experience taught him a lesson in perseverance. As an undergraduate, {{he was a member of}} Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. After completion of his bachelor's degree in physical education in 1970, Friedgen served as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, before later accepting positions on the staffs of The Citadel, William and Mary, and Murray State. Joining him on many of these coaching stops was Frank Beamer, who later served as head coach at Virginia Tech.|$|E

To do really well you must have some knowledge of what birds are rare and what are common, and I should advise <b>you</b> <b>when</b> we <b>get</b> <b>home</b> to spend any time that you have to spare in visiting the Museum and examining the birds there. No doubt {{you will be able to}} find out from one of the attendants which are rare ones, and might be able to consult some books on the subject. You may have the luck to come across skins that are altogether new; and, at any rate, a little knowledge would enable you to exchange your goods to a very much greater advantage than you could otherwise do. A knowledge of that kind is always useful to a sailor, who in his wanderings may well get from the natives rare and valuable specimens in natural history, and there are always plenty of collectors ready to pay good prices for them. I have often regretted that I did not pay attention to such matters when I was young; for besides paying well, it gives a great interest to visits to little-known places, and I have heard of two or three captains who have made a good deal of money by it.” ...|$|R

What an afternoon! We laughed and laughed 2 ̆ 6 then laughed some more. That girl is so funny! She’s {{going to go to}} some {{dramatic}} school 2 ̆ 6 she was telling us some of the things {{she was going to have}} to do. If <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> a date for her, I’m sure he’d have a good time. She isn’t beautiful by any means (who is these days) but she is so funny. I’ve never been out on a date with her but she is a riot all the time. She really is a swell girl 2 ̆ 6 loves people with a sense of humor. I like her loads. I had a wonderful time over there but they got so tired of hearing Judson. Judson 2 ̆ 6 Judson say [sic] this. They were going to murder me. Maybe we’d better change your name to something like Mergatroid or maybe Joe. There were two other girls there. Shirley 2 ̆ 6 Nancy. When Shirley heard me say that <b>you</b> might <b>get</b> Woody a date she almost was down on her knees begging me to get her one. Shirley is funny too. She’s got a voice like a hacksaw going to work but she’s cute 2 ̆ 6 very tall. Between the three of us, we almost had hysterics. Guess what—I was telling them about the Rodeo 2 ̆ 6 got them all excited, so next Saturday there are going to be about seven girls going riding. It’s going to be so funny. None of us can ride well 2 ̆ 6 three of them have never been riding before. That should be something. I can just imagine what a mad house it’s going to be. By the way, how do you like this. This is the second letter I’ve written to you today! How’s that? Oh, I had planned to tell the fellow I was supposed to go to the movies with tonight that I couldn’t go out. Everything turned out fine anyway because he had a sick grandmother—(sounds phoney come to think of it). Judson, you’re really so sweet. I think you’re the first boy I’ve ever really appreciated. You’re almost too good to be true—I hope that you don’t change. Wonder how those pictures will turn out. Honestly, someday I’ll have a good picture taken. By the way, don’t forget that promise you made to send me those pictures of you in your fatigues!! It’s very annoying. There are so many things that I wanted to ask you but whenever <b>you</b> <b>get</b> here they slip my mind. You still haven’t answered that question I asked you—remember? It’s awfully hard to answer, huh? Weekends should be extended. They’re wonderful things. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> stop <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> weekends, it’ll be tragic! Let’s not think about that. There were a lot of questions I wanted to ask you about the first night you came home 2 ̆ 6 called me. Whenever I’m writing <b>you,</b> they just <b>get</b> lost. Remind me next weekend to talk to you about that. Sometimes I think a plane is mighty tough competition! Never having competed with a plane before, I wouldn’t know, but I’m beginning to wonder. Do you know what time you’re going to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> next weekend or what we’re going to do? If you don’t want privacy (and I guarantee you won’t have it) we could stay here 2 ̆ 6 sit in front of the fireplace. Wouldn’t it be nice if you flew all weekend (don’t get excited) and had all week off 2 ̆ 6 could be home? I’ll have to take that up with Frank. Please write soon. It seems as though you’d been away for ages already. This is getting “worser 2 ̆ 6 worser. ” Every week gets longer. Oh well, that’s life. Did I sign that letter I wrote this afternoon. It doesn’t seem to me that I did. Must be love— Lots of love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|R
