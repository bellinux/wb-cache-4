5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the car, Homer realizes he must make it to Central Park to find his family and leave before it gets dark. Ignoring the <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp,</b> he tries to accelerate {{and in the process}} destroys the car's fender. Homer stops by a road construction crew and steals a jackhammer so he can use it to remove the clamp. The car is freed from the clamp, but further damaged as a result. Homer races to Central Park and reunites with his family. While driving back to Springfield, the family reflects on their wonderful time, while Homer's hatred for New York remains.|$|E
25|$|A <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp,</b> {{also known}} as a Denver boot or wheel boot, is a device that is {{designed}} to prevent vehicles from moving. In its most common form, it consists of a clamp which surrounds a vehicle wheel, designed to prevent removal of both itself and the wheel. Wheel clamps are used in order to enforce laws against unauthorized or illegal parking, in lieu of towing the offending vehicle, and for security purposes such as a deterrent against stolen vehicles by thieves. Originally known as the auto immobilizer, the <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp</b> or Denver boot was invented in 1953 by Frank Marugg of Denver Colorado. A patent was filed on May 7, 1955 and issued three years later on July 28, 1958.|$|E

50|$|A {{prolonged}} {{and heated}} disagreement {{between the parties}} then followed that lasted into the early evening. During this Mrs Annette Arthur, who {{had arrived at the}} scene in another vehicle, assaulted Mr Anker, attempts were made to fit a <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp</b> to the vehicle she had been driving and Mr Arthur attempted, unsuccessfully to drive away in his car with the clamp still in place. Ultimately, the various parties departed and Mr Arthur's vehicle was left in the car park for the night with a second <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp</b> fitted to it. At some point during that night Mr Arthur returned and removed both wheel clamps. By the time that Mr Anker returned in the morning {{there was no sign of}} Mr Arthur's vehicle or of the wheel clamps, chains or padlocks.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a before study of some effects of the introduction of <b>wheel</b> <b>clamps</b> in Central London. Park and visit, vehicle following, registration number and business interview surveys were conducted in two areas of Central London: Mayfair in which <b>wheel</b> <b>clamps</b> were to be introduced, and Bloomsbury where they were not. The surveys were designed to determine the availability of parking spaces, the extent to which vehicles searched for parking spaces, the time spent doing so and gaining access to destinations, the level of through traffic, and the parking problems perceived by businesses. They were complementary to a series of surveys conducted by consultants for TRRL. The report describes the design and piloting of the surveys, {{presents the}} results of the surveys, identifies the levels of change which it will be possible statistically to detect and makes recommendations for the after surveys. In particular it recommends that the park and visit and vehicle following surveys be repeated, and also presents arguments in favour of repeating the business survey and conducting a survey on trade...|$|R
40|$|EP 253181 A UPAB: 19930923 A fixture for a {{grinding}} wheel to an electric angle grinder {{is based on}} a clamping flange by which the <b>wheel</b> is <b>clamped</b> to the abutment of the hollow spindle. This flange is screwed to the threaded pin of a clamping pin. The cavity between the surfaces is filled with a plastic matrial, e. g. PVC of a low degree of polymerisation which is poured in as a liq. when hot and becomes a jelly when cold. By applying the lever on the thrust disc, the plunger is moved to displace the jelly in one of the cavities for a firm connection between for the <b>wheel</b> <b>clamped</b> between. ADVANTAGE - This relieves the clamping flange only when the grinding disc is to be changed and is ideal for one-hand grinders...|$|R
50|$|On being engaged, Armtrac {{erected a}} number of {{prominent}} notices warning those that parked in the area without authority or permission that it was private property and their vehicles were liable to being <b>wheel</b> <b>clamped</b> and might, also, be removed. The notices made clear that a release fee must be paid before a clamp was removed and that additional fees had to be paid if the vehicle was towed away. The prominence of the notices and {{the simplicity of the}} message they sought to convey was never at issue during the ensuing case.|$|R

50|$|The {{best known}} <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp</b> in the UK is the 'London Wheel Clamp'. The designer, Trevor Whitehouse and patent owner of device number GB2251416A filed the patent in 1991. He {{originally}} called the device the 'Preston', after {{his home town}} in Lancashire. Primarily used on private land, its notoriety grew once it was introduced to public roads under the Road Traffic Regulations Act of 1991 (commonly known as the de-criminalising of the yellow lines act). The first areas {{in the country to}} be decriminalised were the 33 London Boroughs during 1993/94, hence the name change.|$|E
5000|$|They {{held that}} Mr Arthur was {{fully aware of}} the fact that he was {{trespassing}} and that by doing so he exposed himself to the risk of his vehicle being clamped. By entering onto the land and being aware of the risk he had consented to the clamping (Volenti non fit injuria - [...] "to a willing person, injury is not done") and there had been no tortious interference with his vehicle on Mr Anker's part, by his fitting Mr Arthur's vehicle with a <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp,</b> as a consequence.|$|E
50|$|Bodemeijer {{was convicted}} of the murder, but {{according}} to the judge there was not enough evidence to define and see it as an act of racism. Bodemeijer was involuntarily committed in an institution for minors. He was released in 1988 but was jailed once more for another, non-lethal, stabbing, in a bar in 1990. In 1998 he threw a plant pot from an upstairs balcony on a parking warden placing a <b>wheel</b> <b>clamp</b> on his car, narrowly missing hitting him. This generated some new publicity. According to a Dutch television station, Bodemeijer committed suicide in January 2012.|$|E
50|$|As the {{automobile}} was introduced and became popular, cars {{also became a}} target for thieves and for a new concept that became known as joyriding. A variety of after-market security devices were introduced. An early invention were locking <b>wheel</b> <b>clamps</b> or chocks that owners could shackle {{onto one of the}} car's road wheels as a hobble, making it impossible to roll the vehicle unless the entire wheel was removed. Between 1914 and 1925 there were at least 25 patents related to wheel locks that attached on the tire and spoke wheel. These devices were available in many sizes from a number of manufacturers (including several patented by Miller-Chapman), and became popular during the early 1920s.|$|R
40|$|This Report {{compares the}} results of the Before and After studies of some effects of the {{introduction}} of <b>wheel</b> <b>clamps</b> in Central London. Park and Visit and Vehicle Following studies were carried out in both cases, with Registration Number and Business Interview surveys taking place in the Before study only. The two areas of Central London which were studied comprised an area of Mayfair in which <b>wheel</b> <b>clamps</b> were to be introduced, and an area of Bloomsbury in which they were not. The surveys were designed to identify changes related to congestion and ease of access effects and so complement a series of surveys conducted by consultants for TRRL. The report describes each survey methodology, and presents {{the results of}} the Park and Visit and Vehicle Following surveys. A significant reduction in journey times is identified in Bloomsbury but not in Mayfair. However, the confidence intervals for Mayfair were too wide to determine whether the change in travel times in Bloomsbury was significantly different from the change in Mayfair. Significant reductions in search time are recorded in both areas, and a significant reduction in search plus walk time in Bloomsbury. An increase in empty meter spaces is identified in Mayfair and these findings from the Park and Visit surveys are supported by evidence from the Vehicle Following survey which suggests a drop in the degree of searching for meter spaces in Mayfair. Note: Further details of the survey {{are to be found in}} the associated technical note to this report (May et al, 1984 b) and the individual reports on the Park and Visit and Vehicle Following surveys (May et al, 1984 a) ...|$|R
