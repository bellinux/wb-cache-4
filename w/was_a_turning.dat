5|$|Two {{unsettled}} historiographic debates exist {{revolving around}} the operation: whether the Egyptians were intending to advance toward Tel Aviv, which most historians agree {{was not the}} case; and whether the operation <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point on the Israeli southern front. Traditional Israeli historiography, supported by early Arab accounts, maintains that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point, while later Arab sources, and New Historians, dispute this.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was {{an important first step}} in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Posada <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> {{point in}} Hungarian-Wallachian relations: {{though in the}} course of the 14th century, the kings of Hungary still tried to {{regulate}} the voivodes of Wallachia more than one time, but they could only succeed temporarily.

After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass would not consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk to serve as an example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.|$|E

The match <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point for Welsh rugby, who won 12–3, but the selectors stuck with Bedell-Sivright who won another 21 caps for his country.

5|$|During {{the period}} 1814–1815, Hermes o Logios reached an {{absolute}} low, with seven issues in 1814 {{and only one}} in 1815, which consisted of 16 pages written by Korais and directed against his ideological adversary, the conservative scholar, Neophytos Doukas. On the other hand, Gazis returned. In the following years, however, the periodical was subsidized by the princes of Moldavia, Scarlat Callimachi and Michael Soutzos. Apart from the difficulties faced, 1816 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point, as two scholars and adherents of Korais, Theoklitos Farmakidis and Konstantinos Kokkinakis, were placed in charge. Consequently, Hermes o Logios actually became an outlet for Korais and continued to appear without interruption until the Greek War of Independence.|$|E

5|$|The Split Agreement <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> {{point in}} the Bosnian War {{as well as an}} {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission was}} part of a {{movement}} by Gregory to turn away from the East, and look to the Western parts of the old Roman Empire. After Gregory, a number of his successors as pope continued in the same vein, and maintained papal support for the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. The missionary efforts of Augustine and his companions, along with those of the Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, were the model for the later Anglo-Saxon missionaries to Germany. The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the Gregorian mission <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point in papal missionary strategy, marking the beginnings of a policy of persuasion rather than coercion.|$|E
5|$|The venue {{became an}} adult cinema in the 1970s. The success of Deep Throat in 1972 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point, {{leading to an}} {{increase}} in the number of adult film screenings at more than a dozen cinemas in Portland. However, the rise of video cassettes and cable television led to a decline in cinema attendance, and by the 2000s, the Maizels family had sold all of their properties except for the Oregon Theatre. Gayne Maizels still owns the theater, which continues to operate as the city's longest running pornographic cinema.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late February the communist offensive collapsed. Suffering more than 45,000 killed—against South Vietnamese and allied losses of only 6,000 men—it {{had been a}} tactical disaster for the communists. Regardless, the offensive <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point in the war. Prior to Tet American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had {{reached the point where}} the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the fighting, and the surprise and violence with which the offensive was launched, had shocked the public, contradicting such predictions of imminent victory. Confidence in the military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in America. Ultimately, Tet was a publicity and media triumph for the communists, and Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory. In its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office.|$|E

5|$|Instead, {{he took up}} a {{position}} with , Belgium's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted Le Soir to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining the Le Soir team on 15 October, Hergé {{was involved in the}} creation of a children's supplement, Soir-Jeunesse, aided by Jamin and Jacques Van Melkebeke. He relaunched The Adventures of Tintin with a new story, The Crab with the Golden Claws, in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point in the series for its introduction of Captain Haddock, who would become a major character in the rest of the Adventures. This story, like the subsequent Adventures of Tintin published in Le Soir, would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral. Hergé also included new Quick & Flupke gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by Edgar Allan Poe and the Brothers Grimm.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9, 1929, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point {{that marked the}} beginning of the VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E
