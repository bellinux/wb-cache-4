[...] This sentiment was re-iterated by executive producer Brad Falchuk, after the characters kissed for the first time. He revealed that their relationship would not run smoothly, and observed that once couples start dating, [...] "Everything goes to hell." [...] Colfer suggested that Kurt returning to McKinley may cause difficulties in their relationship, but noted [...] "Distance makes the heart grow fonder, right? That’s <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> me. So {{even if they do}} go through some bumps in the road, it would be very realistic." [...] In a Q with Billboard on the day [...] "Born This Way" [...] ran with Kurt's McKinley return, Criss stated that Blaine and Kurt were [...] "in the honeymoon stages" [...] of their relationship, and would still be [...] "at the end of the [...] season".|$|E

2500|$|On 27 February 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that Westbrook would reprise the role {{for a few}} episodes. Her return will coincide with Kemp's return as Sam's brother Grant and Windsor's final appearance as Sam's mother Peggy. Of her return Westbrook said, 'I'm really excited to be going back to EastEnders". Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen. Sam will only be back for a few episodes, but these scenes are bound to go down in the soap's history." [...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock. It's obviously {{been a long time since}} anyone has seen her and she is trouble through and through. But Peggy is her mum, so of course she had to be there for the funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't be going back to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what they always do use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab. I wish @bbceastenders would listen to the public more. But either way I'm grateful of the 4 episodes I got to film." [...] Her return scenes aired on 30 June with her final scenes aired on 8 July 2016. In March 2017, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising her role as Sam but feared the show would just use her for publicity. On 11 May 2017, Westbrook claimed during an interview on Loose Women that she would be reprising her role as Sam later in the year, however an EastEnders source denied this, saying, [...] "There are no plans for Danniella to return, it's just not going to happen. It's very odd that she keeps harping on about her return to the soap cause it has plainly never been discussed." ...|$|E
