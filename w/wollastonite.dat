25|$|Precipitation in {{the form}} of liquid (rain) or solid (snow) varies in {{composition}} depending on atmospheric temperature, pressure, composition, and altitude. Hot atmospheres could have iron rain, molten-glass rain, and rain made from rocky minerals such as enstatite, corundum, spinel, and <b>wollastonite.</b> Deep in the atmospheres of gas giants, it could rain diamonds and helium containing dissolved neon.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; {{a large amount}} of the phenocrysts are {{ultimately}} derived from them. Hornfels, skarn, and rocks derived from Lascar's lava dome ridge form these xenoliths. Minerals encountered in xenoliths include andradite, anhydrite, anorthite, apatite, biotite, calcite, diopside, fassaite, garnet, gypsum, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, perovskite, plagioclase, prehnite, quartz, sphene, thorite, wilkeite, <b>wollastonite</b> and zircon. A number of such xenoliths formed from carbonate rocks that were influenced by magma from Lascar and from other volcanoes such as Tumisa.|$|E
25|$|Grossular is a calcium-aluminium garnet {{with the}} formula Ca3Al2(SiO4)3, though the calcium may in part be {{replaced}} by ferrous iron and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name grossular {{is derived from the}} botanical name for the gooseberry, grossularia, in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia. Other shades include cinnamon brown (cinnamon stone variety), red, and yellow. Because of its inferior hardness to zircon, which the yellow crystals resemble, they have also been called hessonite from the Greek meaning inferior. Grossular is found in contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, <b>wollastonite</b> and wernerite.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and <b>wollastonite.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to livestock, mining is another traditional element of Sonora’s economy, {{beginning with a}} major find {{near the city of}} Álamos. While the silver of that area has mostly been depleted, Sonora still plays a large part in Mexico’s standing {{as one of the top}} fifteen producers of minerals in the world, leading in silver, celestite and bismuth. Sonora is the leading producer of gold, copper, graphite, molybdenum, and <b>wollastonite.</b> There are still deposits of silver in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Sonora also has one of the largest coal reserves in the country. The state has the largest mining surface in Mexico, and three of the country’s largest mines: La Caridad, Cananea and Mineria María. It is also home to North America’s oldest copper mine, located in Cananea. Grupo México, with one of its principle mining operations in Cananea, is the world’s third-largest copper producer. In 2002, mines produced 6,634.5 kilograms of gold, 153,834 kilograms of silver, five tons of lead, 267,171 tons of copper, three tons of zinc, 18,961 tons of iron, 7,176 tons barium sulphate. However, annual production is heavily dependent on world market prices.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of <b>wollastonite</b> and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, <b>wollastonite,</b> silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E
2500|$|Temperatures of the {{magma chamber}} {{range from the}} mafic magmas that are {{injected}} in the chamber are about [...] hotter than the extant andesite and dacite. The chamber may be surrounded by skarnic alteration. This alteration gives rise to <b>wollastonite</b> and pyroxene-containing skarn, depending on {{the distance from the}} magma chamber walls. Metasomatism does further affect rocks derived from magma chamber walls. The conditions at the magma chamber may be comparable to these under which epithermal mineral deposits form. The oxidation conditions in the magma chamber are favourable for the formation of sulfate, but unfavourable for the deposition of sulfide minerals.|$|E
2500|$|As in the past, the state’s {{dominant}} {{sector is}} mining, accounting for 13% of the state’s GDP and [...]9% {{of the entire}} country’s. The state is rich in mineral wealth include lead, zinc and copper with small quantities of gold and silver, along with non-metal mineral deposits such as kaolinite, <b>wollastonite,</b> fluorite and barite. The state has fifteen mining districts of which the most important are Fresnillo, Zacatecas, Concepción del Oro, Sombrerete and Chalchihuites, along with Nora de Angeles more recently. [...] Zacatecas accounts for 21% of the country’s gold production and 53.2% of its silver. Two of the largest silver mines in the world currently are operated in Zacatecas, the Fresnillo-Zacatecas Silver Mine and the Peñasquito Polymetallic Mine. Zacatecas silver mostly accounts for Mexico’s status as the world’s largest producer of silver, accounting for 17% of the world’s output.|$|E
2500|$|Fritware {{refers to}} a type of pottery which was first {{developed}} in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. Frit was a significant ingredient. A recipe for “fritware” dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to “frit-glass” to white clay is 10:1:1. This type of pottery has also {{been referred to as}} “stoneware" [...] and “faience” among other names. A ninth-century corpus of “proto-stoneware” from Baghdad has “relict glass fragments” in its fabric. The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, <b>wollastonite</b> and diopside crystals formed within the glass fragments. The lack of “inclusions of crushed pottery” suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze. The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so “accelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the hardness and density of the [...] body.” ...|$|E
50|$|Pseudowollastonite is a {{high-temperature}} mineral {{phase of}} CaSiO3 and is polymorphous with <b>wollastonite.</b> Its formula can alternatively be written as Ca3Si3O9. Other names include <b>wollastonite</b> 7T, ß-Wollastonite, and cyclowollastonite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wollastonite</b> {{crystallizes}} triclinically {{in space}} group P with the lattice constants a = 7.94 Å, b = 7.32 Å, c = 7.07 Å; α = 90,03°, β = 95,37°, γ = 103,43° and six formula units per unit cell. <b>Wollastonite</b> was once classed structurally among the pyroxene group, because {{both of these}} groups have a ratio of Si:O = 1:3. In 1931, Warren and Biscoe showed that the crystal structure of <b>wollastonite</b> differs from minerals of the pyroxene group, and they classified this mineral within a group known as the pyroxenoids. It {{has been shown that}} the pyroxenoid chains are more kinked than those of pyroxene group, and exhibit longer repeat distance. The structure of <b>wollastonite</b> contains infinite chains of SiO4 tetrahedra sharing common vertices, running parallel to the b-axis. The chain motif in <b>wollastonite</b> repeats after three tetrahedra, whereas in pyroxenes only two are needed. The repeat distance in the <b>wollastonite</b> chains is 7.32 Å and equals the length of the crystallographic b-axis.|$|E
50|$|World {{production}} data for <b>wollastonite</b> {{is not available}} for many countries {{and those that are}} available frequently are 2 to 3 years old. Estimated world production of crude <b>wollastonite</b> ore was in the range of 530,000 to 550,000 tonnes in 2010.

50|$|<b>Wollastonite</b> has {{industrial}} importance worldwide. It {{is used in}} many industries, {{mostly by}} tile factories which have incorporated it into the manufacturing of ceramic to improve many performance parameters, and {{this is due to}} its fluxing properties, freedom from volatile constituents, whiteness, and acicular particle shape. In ceramics, <b>wollastonite</b> decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing, increases green and fired strength, maintains brightness during firing, permits fast firing, and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, <b>wollastonite</b> serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and to protect the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel. As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves its resistance to weathering, reduces gloss, reduces pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and suspending agent. In plastics, <b>wollastonite</b> improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between the <b>wollastonite</b> and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, <b>wollastonite</b> is resistant to chemical attack, inert, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength. In some industries, it is used in different percentages of impurities, such as its use as a fabricator of mineral wool insulation, or as an ornamental building material.|$|E
