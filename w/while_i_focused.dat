While collecting suitable data several unknown hydraulic quantities of the water supply system that are not measured or are just approximations of true measured values. These challenges, which {{made it difficult to}} construct a hydraulic model, led me to elaborating suggestions and a system for quality data collection and measurements for hydraulic modeling of water supply systems. This way I elaborated a measurement scheme that did not involve only the important hydraulic structures on the water supply system, but also the newly proposed DMA zones. The number of measurement locations is can be arbitrary, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on a scheme that would ensure the collection of sufficient quality data to form a calibrated hydraulic model. This would guarantee sufficient measurement data for a calibration process...|$|E

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{focused on a}} {{specific}} group of {{children with special needs}} who have a long-term illness. We often don't realize how hard it is when children develop a difficult illness and what problems they and their parents face. In this thesis I described children with long-term illness and their characteristics <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on how a diagnosis of a serious illness affects their lives. Because those children are still part of the educational system despite their illness I focused on the role of teachers in teaching and including them in the school system. In the empirical part of my thesis I conducted two interviews {{to find out more about}} the role of teachers in including children with long-term illness in the educational system. The answers from the teacher and the class teacher that I collected in the interviews show that collaboration between teachers and children with long-term illnesses is of high importance since it leads to the children completing their schoolwork successfully. A class teacher has a somewhat bigger role in including those children in the educational system because he has a more personal relationship with them and their parents, rather than a teacher who teaches only a certain subject. ...|$|E

I first discuss some of the key issues in the “social priming” debate and then attempt to show that many of the problems thus far identified are traceable to a lack of specificity of theory. Finally, I hint at the possibility that adherence to the materialist tenets of modern psychological theory may have a limiting effect on our full appreciation of the phenomena under scrutiny...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{draws on}} my pilot study which {{was part of}} the EdD course I am currently undertaking. As part of the programme, I was asked to carry out a pilot study to “try out” the ideas and theoretical framework I proposed to apply in my main research. The objectives of the pilot study were informed by my experience teaching and assessing students in the early years-related degree programmes, mainly female mature students who lacked confidence in their academic ability but excelled at work. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on the university experience {{and its impact on the}} professional work of the participants, my pilot study highlighted my lack of acknowledgment of the maternal discourse which was the most frequent theme within the data. This came as a surprise to me; therefore, the aims of both the main study and this pilot study had to be altered to include the exploration of the maternal discourse. This study followed a Foucauldian-informed feminist post-structural approach. Further, three semi-structured interviews were conducted with recently graduated early years practitioners who started their careers as parent helpers. The interview focused on (1) the reason why the respondent joined the course, (2) the last two years of the respondent’s experience as a student and practitioner, (3) the way parent helpers are positioned and positioning themselves within their work and the university environment, and (4) the role of the respondent in the setting. Thematic narrative approach was applied to understand the maternal discourses (Riessman, 2000). In this poster, I present my reflection on a pilot study and the unexpected findings from the qualitative data I have collected through the narratives of three recently graduated early years practitioners. The results arose from the narratives which were linked to the recurrent theme of maternal discourse. To analyse the data, a thematic approach, which involves comparing the accounts from a sample of interviewees with similar experiences, was used. The next step was coding the data, which followed by labeling and grouping them, using connections of the theoretical framework (Riessman, 2008; Gee, 2014). The data analysis and discussion was divided under two subgroups; firstly, how discourses of motherhood are mobilised to construct the professional self; and secondly, the intersections of gender, age, class, and motherhood in constructions and performances of the professional self. In this way, the assumption that being a mother makes you a better childcare worker was problematizes. The context in which the study has been conducted is linked to the widening participation (WP) agenda which has been identified as economically and socially beneficial at national and individual levels (Leathwood and Read, 2007) ...|$|E
40|$|After {{conducting}} {{extensive research}} at the Public Record Office at Kew, London, which involved unearthing documents pertaining to Brunei-UK relationships between 1966 and 1984, I decided to focus my work on Brunei's political development between those periods of time. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> my work on this field, {{it became obvious that}} Brunei's security and survival remained the main issues that posed challenges and difficulties to the Sultans of Brunei. Starting in 1966, it was indeed a crucial year because this was when Britain decided to end its protection over Brunei. As a result of this decision, Britain put more pressure on the Sultan to implement a democratic system of government in the Sultanate. Britain's insistence that the Sultan should implement the system was supported by Malaysia and Brunei's local party. This demand for democracy posed challenges and difficulties concerning Brunei's security and survival, as it could reduce the power of the Sultan and would bring Brunei within Malaysia. Britain's decision also troubled the Sultan, as it would leave Brunei inadequately protected from any internal and external threats or attacks. Consequently the Sultan was apprehensive over Malaysia, which still wanted to bring Brunei within the Federation of Malaysia, and Indonesia for its past support of the 1962 Bruneian ex-rebels and for harbouring the leader of the rebellion, Azahari, {{after the end of the}} rebellion. In this study I hope to give a clearer understanding of Brunei's history particularly between 1966 and 1984, as previous authors of Brunei's history have either not touched at all or only touched briefly on Britain's demands on the Sultan to implement a democratic system of government and Malaysia's persistent objective to bring Brunei within Malaysia. Furthermore, none of the authors of Brunei's history has studied in any detail the issues arising from Malaysia's intention to bring Brunei within Malaysia, i. e., the escape of Brunei's 1962 ex-rebels to Limbang (which made Brunei's call for the return of Limbang an urgent matter) and the- ex-rebels' political activities outside Brunei between 1973 and 1975, which had the support of the Malaysian government and other foreign countries and international organizations. This study benefits from the use of the documents pertaining to Brunei-UK relationships (from 1966 onwards) that are available at the Public Record Office but that previous authors of Brunei's history have not used. Although there is a shortcoming in this study that is the unavailability of records for the period 1976 until 1984, I have used local and foreign newspapers and secondary materials which are available in various institutions both in Brunei and abroad. In addition, I have carried out interviews with key figures pertaining to the issues mentioned above in order to pursue the study. The method used in the study is chronological so that the events and issues highlighted in this thesis can be adequately discussed and followed.

I do so from a standpoint which sees a number of ethical issues as central to professional social work practice namely a commitment to equality of treatment, to empowering service users and {{to the principle of}} accountability. My concern here is twofold: to ask whether there is any connection between the ethical issues underpinning professional practice and the legal framework which seeks to regulate such practice; and second, on the basis that the two are connected, what might this mean for how we think about the law ­ social work relationship? In addressing this question <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on the area of children and families much of what I have to say is of general relevance to social work.

40|$|One {{important}} historical {{consequence of}} the discoveries of Freud and his co-workers has been the widespread acceptance among psycho-therapists (of various persuasions, many of whom would not describe themselves as “Freudian”) {{of what might be}} labeled the impedance view of almost all psychological aberration. In suggesting this locution I do not mean to pseudo-solve theoretical or therapeutic problems by a piece of novel semantics.

40|$|From {{the break}} {{up of the}} New Left into single issue groups {{at the end of}} the 1960 s came a variety of groups {{representing}} the peace movement, environmental movement, student movement, women’s movement, and gay liberation movement. This explosion of new social movement activism has been heralded as the age of new radical politics. Many theorists and activists understand new social movements, as replacing the working class as an agent for progressive social change. Scholars and activists now alike debate the possibilities for revolutionary change in this era of multinational capitalism and new nationalisms. This paper examines some of the above claims in the context of the contemporary Serbian civil society. It explores the relationship between the civil society, activism, and narratives in Serbia. In particular, it examines the anti-Milosevic’ movement Otpor!

40|$|This study {{examines}} adoption {{in a range}} of twentieth-century American cultural texts: novels, plays and films. Adoption narratives, I argue, hold in relief the process through which individuals are recognized within the public discourse of family and community. Both highly regulated and elusive, adoption enables individuals to assume 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 (legitimate) roles within their adoptive families while obscuring their 2 ̆ 2 spurious 2 ̆ 2 (illegitimate) origins. How adoptive subjects are recognized in society depends ultimately on their ability or willingness to perform the rhetoric of legitimacy. ^ Not only do citational practices enact adoptive identities, but the rhetoric of legitimacy naturalizes this process by referring obliquely to biology as the model for relatedness. This linguistic component serves to complicate identity issues faced by displaced subjects who must forge so-called unnatural social relations, adoptive bonds that mimic the biological. In this way, adoption reminds us that even biological kinship is wrought through language and configured as primal. ^ <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> mainly on literal adoptees, characters newly placed or caught between families, I recognize an important link between these characters and more symbolic adoptees, individuals who are culturally displaced or politically dispossessed. Adoption in literature works to expose rents in the social fabric, places where issues of belonging are in dispute. I begin my analysis by examining the force of records to determine characters in works by William Faulkner and Louise Erdrich. In both cases, culture mediates the efficacy of record-keeping and the dissemination of identity. From here, I explore more directly the fluidity of cultural claims made by adoptees in works by Bharati Mukherjee and Leslie Marmon Silko. I examine the performative function of adoption in plays by Edward Albee and John Guare. And finally, <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on 2 ̆ 2 the face of adoption, 2 ̆ 2 by examining how adoption materializes in recent Hollywood films. This study initiates connections between adoption and issues of difference and diversity by exploring the way culture and language converge in the expression of the adoptive subject. ...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{inspired}} by Lipsitz (1998) and Allport (1954) because both authors connect micro level processes to social macro level patterns. Allport’s Nature of Prejudice sought to understand patterns of anti-Semitism as connected to a larger social context. From this work, Allport developed the contact hypothesis which is premised {{on the idea that}} diversity helps alleviate racial tensions. Lipsitz’ Possessive Investment in Whiteness connects White racial privilege to a history of racial social inequality. In conintuum, I develop the nuances on prejudice formation as it leads to the denial of racial privilege or to the conflation of privileges as oppression. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on White racial privilege, the theoretical contribution of my research develops the framework for individual privilege formation. I then draw upon Bonilla-Silva’s (2013) racial colorblind theory to emphasize the connection between privilege and larger patterns of racial attitudes. The macro level contribution of this dissertation focuses on patterns of overt and colorblind attitudes as affected by racial segregation, social inequality, and respondent characteristics. Data was gathered from the 2000 General Social Survey, 2010 GSS, and U. S. Census county data and applied to a hierarchical linear model. Due to sample selection, this research focuses on racial Whites’ attitudes about the racial Black population. I use measures of racial segregation as proxies for racial contact. I find patterns of racial tolerance through a ‘separate but equal’ storyline among White-Black segregation. When using, social demographics with all minorities included, I find that Whites’ attitudes about racial Blacks are attenuated. This finding supports the literature that non-Black racial minorities act as buffers for White-Black racial relations. Racial diversity is one element in helping alleviate negative racial sentiments, but patterns of segregation and social inequality impact the benefits of this racial diversity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} complex intersections {{of sexuality and}} power in sixteenth century Florence. The research analyzes institutions as arbiters of culture and authorities of orthodoxy, and argues that literary texts offer critical insights into an understanding of witchcraft, sexuality, and structures of power. ^ Part I presents an extended analysis of comic representations of witches; my {{emphasis is on the}} erotic possibilities and subversive potential of the rhetoric of witchcraft. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on two plays by Antonfrancesco Grazzini [...] La Spiritata and La Strega [...] I also consider texts and cultural productions of a non-literary nature: inquisitorial handbooks and trials; medical treatises; legal codes; marriage manuals; and historiography of the family. In Part II, I broaden the perspective, studying carnival songs, comedies, and novellas which deal with homoerotic sexuality and 2 ̆ 2 sodomy, 2 ̆ 2 in chapter 4, while in chapter 5, I concentrate on superstition as an instrument of oppression {{in the life of the}} subjugated. I situate the literary material in the context of the Florentine ducal state, and I argue that anti-Medicean writers explored and celebrated erotic and homoerotic relations in order to question and expose the absolutist strategies of Cosimo de 2 ̆ 7 Medici 2 ̆ 7 s Florence. ^ This study engages with many theoretical debates, favoring a historicist, feminist project that takes seriously both the context of the author and the status of the literary text as distinct from other forms of cultural production. The Erotics of Witchcraft and the Politics of Desire in Renaissance Florence is intended to be a contribution to the scholarship of the history of sexuality and an intervention in the ongoing debates about the persecution of witches and sodomites in the past. ...|$|R

The proposed technique is based on the linearization of a physical device model around a nominal process parameter, and on the evaluation of relevant Green's functions linking the parameter variations to the terminal performance. This provides, for the first time, a unified and computationally efficient simulation framework for the device physics-based sensitivity in dc, SS, LS, and SS-LS conditions.

Being an inverse problem, it has limitations due to the presence of random and systematic errors. We present in theses series of papers an analysis of the robustness of the inversion in the case of AIA/SDO observations. We completely characterize the DEM inversion and its statistical properties, providing all the solutions consistent with the data along with their associated probabilities, and a test of the suitability of the assumed DEM model. <b>While</b> Paper <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on isothermal conditions, we now consider multi-thermal plasmas and investigate both isothermal and multithermal solutions. We demonstrate how the ambiguity between noises and multi-thermality fundamentally limits the temperature resolution of the inversion. We show that if the observed plasma is multi-thermal, isothermal solutions tend to cluster on a constant temperature whatever the number of passbands or spectral lines. The multi-thermal solutions are also found to be biased toward near isothermal solutions around 1 MK. This is true even if the residuals support the chosen DEM model, possibly leading to erroneous conclusions on the observed plasma. We propose tools to identify and quantify the possible degeneracy of solutions, thus helping the interpretation of DEM inversion. Comment: 24 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

40|$|In {{the matter}} of a few decades, the Supreme Court in Mexico has gone from being a passive {{institution}} that served the interests of the federal executive to a genuine enforcer of law and the final arbiter in an increasing number of disputes over power and resources between different branches and levels of government. My thesis traces how and why this change happened and analyses the consequences of a more independent and active Court for the processes of federalism and democratisation in Mexico. My research contributes to a growing body of literature on the judicialisation of politics in Mexico. I analyse the ways in which a more genuine separation of powers has begun to take shape in Mexico. Specifically, I look at how a more independent Supreme Court has provided different government powers at the federal, state and municipal levels with a means of defending their respective jurisdictions against competing powers. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on the Supreme Court, my research situates the judiciary within the wider web of government institutions; increased political pluralism has enabled the legislative branch and state and local governments to exercise stronger checks and balances on the federal executive, with attendant consequences for the emboldened Court when it comes to involvement in the policy-making process. At the core of my thesis is an empirical analysis of the Supreme Court's involvement in federalist issues via the use of constitutional controversies filed before the Court between 1995 and 2005 to resolve federal intragovernmental (between the three branches of government) and intergovernmental (between levels of government) disputes. The analysis operates on two levels: the national, and the subnational via an examination of legal recourses in seven case study states. It also looks at the role of the electoral tribunal in national and local election disputes. A wide variety of political actors are resorting to legal channels in order to resolve political deadlock. The Supreme Court in Mexico has had the last word on issues that range from the generation of electricity to indigenous rights.

I aim at the role of special-pedagogical centres and pedagogical-psychological consultancy offices in the process of integration. The main goal of my thesis was to identify how the conditions of integration are fulfilled {{from the point of view}} of the Headmasters of schools, teachers, assistants, pedagogues, and, but not limited to, the parents themselves. For the satisfaction of the main goal, I set up three partial goals. At first, to identify the financial conditions of the integration, at second, to find out the extent of the awareness of the pedagogues, and at first, what the activity of special- pedagogical centres is, and/or of the pedagogical-psychological consultancy offices in this area of their professional work. For my research, I used a questionnaire survey at which I attempted to find out the opinions, attitudes and experience of the pedagogues as well of the parents of the integrated pupils. For the survey at the consultancy school facilities I employed the methods of a semi-controlled interview. Through my survey performed, I managed to find out that the addressed respondents showed, in the majority of the cases, a positive approach to integration. The Headmasters of schools see, as the core one, the problem of insufficient financial funds for the integration. The teachers particularly encounter partial problems directly at the time of teaching. The approach of all assistants of pedagogues to integration is positive, however their workload is not clearly defined. From the parents' point view, the conditions for the integration are good, and they see in it an unambiguous benefit for their children. Integration in the Czech Republic is legislatively supported, but in the normal life of schools it however has been facing both the financial and practical difficulties. Because in the Chomutov District, there is only a special-pedagogical centre aimed at defects of hearing, I believe that a facility focused on all types of handicap would be vastly beneficial...|$|R

Sc. degree, I {{believed}} {{it would take}} a <b>while</b> until <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on a specific research subject or even on a general research field. Having no biological background, I was lucky enough to take two of my first year’s classes with my advisor, Prof. Ron Shamir, who introduced me to the exciting world of computational biology and allowed me to hop on the research train in his wonderful laboratory in Tel-Aviv. I would like to thank him for the giving me the opportunity, trust and guidance through the hills and valleys we shared during the time. I {{would also like to thank}} my co-advisor, Prof. Gideon Dror, for his enlightening insights on machine learning, gluing together learning theory and computational biology in a way that was crucial for the success of this work. Throughout the time, I was surrounded by a group of great people, who constitute the amazing DNA of Ron Shamir’s Algorithms in Computational Genomics in Tel-Aviv university. I thank Igor Ulitsky for teaching me most of what I know about the practical side of computational biology, Chaim Linhart for his wonderful methodological advices, Gal Romano for introducing me to real biological experiments, and Michael Gotkin and Didi Amar for sharing with me the work on the GenePark Project.

40|$|The {{topic of}} my diploma thesis is The yield, risk and {{liquidity}} of investment options. In the introductory {{part of this}} thesis, I define the concept of investment. Furthermore, I deal with the financial market theory and with the characteristics of the subsegments which work within this market. I also define securities, their types and specifics. The next part of the thesis is aimed at the investment strategy which should help an investor to proceed reasonably <b>while</b> investing. Herein, <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on the rules of the magic triangle and on the definition of the yield, risk and liquidity. I mention the theory of the investment portfolio as well. This is followed by the description of the selected investment options divided into subchapters about individual and collective investments; this being the selection of only the most important investment instruments one can use both in the money market and in the stock market. In the rest of the thesis, I deal with the creating of an individuals investment portfolio and with the comparison of the yield, risk and liquidity of the selected options...|$|R
40|$|My diploma thesis {{deals with}} social support of chosen roles which occur while {{bullying}} {{the role of}} a victim and a defender. The diploma paper is divided into two consecutive parts a theoretical and a practical one. In the beginning of the theoretical part I introduced the problems of bullying and identified the roles which can be present <b>while</b> bullying. <b>I</b> also <b>focused</b> on the characteristics of terms: social support, capturing its forms, the participants of bullying and last, but not least the differences in children´s age. The practical part contains mixed (quantitative and qualitative) research methods. There are two goals of the research, the first is to reveal the potential roles of participants of bullying in a class team, and the second one is to detect the level of social support provided by teachers and classmates to defenders and victims of bullying. The qualitative research works as a supplement, it is focused to opinions and attitudes of defenders and victims considering the behaviour while bullying...|$|R

Further, this thesis compares these costs with promotion and sponsorship costs which are frequently interchanged in practice.

40|$|Title page {{publication}} date is May 2015. Vita and public. pdf file indicate {{publication date}} is May (Spring) 2016. Dissertation supervisor: Peter Markie, Ph. D. Includes vita. In my dissertation, I {{argue for a}} novel interpretation of Reid's moral epistemology. Accordingly, I attempt to show that Reid {{is committed to the}} view that we obtain moral knowledge by way of moral intuition and moral perception. I maintain that, by way of moral intuition, one obtains knowledge of what Reid calls moral first principles, which constitute the set of basic or foundational moral beliefs from which all other moral beliefs are ultimately inferred; moreover, I believe moral intuition and perception, at least on Reid's account, provides one with knowledge of moral particulars (e. g., whether a particular action is morally wrong or right or whether a particular individual is virtuous or vicious). Furthermore, I show how Reid's account of moral perception and intuition fits with his other philosophical commitments. I then show exactly how the belief-forming processes of intuition and perception enables us to obtain knowledge of moral reality. Finally, I respond to a number of objections one might raise to my interpretation of Reid or Reid's moral philosophy in general. Ultimately, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> mainly <b>focus</b> on what <b>I</b> take to be the most accurate and philosophically plausible account of Reid's moral epistemology, I largely put aside contemporary applications of Reid's moral epistemology. Nonetheless, I think the arguments defended in this dissertation help set the foundation for applying Reid's moral epistemology to contemporary philosophical issues.
