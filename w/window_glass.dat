5|$|During the 1920s, {{competitors}} developed new <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> {{production processes}} that eclipsed the American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> technology, {{and the company}} lost its advantage. By the time the Great Depression struck, the Hartford City plant had closed.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, Hartford City Glass was {{acquired}} by the American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> Company, which controlled 85 percent of the American <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturing capacity. During the next decade, the company began replacing its skilled and well–paid Belgian glass blowers with machines and less-skilled machine operators. The company used the Hartford City plant to test and refine the new technology. Most of the Belgian glass workers left town.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the skilled}} workers {{employed}} at the Hartford City Glass Company were from Belgium, {{at the time}} the world’s leading manufacturer of <b>window</b> <b>glass.</b> The Belgian workers and their families accounted for over one-third of Hartford City's population during the 1890s, and lived on the city's south side. Because {{of the importance of the}} French-speaking Belgians, one of the local newspapers featured articles in French.|$|E

5|$|The Prince Consort's and Queen Victoria's {{rooms in}} the keep are named after their use during the royal visit of 1842, {{although}} their decoration today dates from the interwar period. The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. These rooms feature a range of pink and purple <b>window</b> <b>glass,</b> which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Window</b> <b>glass</b> {{in antiquity}} could be {{produced}} in three ways; cylinder blown, crown manufacture or cast. In Anglo-Saxon England there is evidence for all three types of methods being used. The vast majority of glass windows were produced by the cylinder blown method, although possibly {{on a smaller scale}} than the classic methods mentioned by Theophilus. Some Anglo-Saxon <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> was produced by the crown method and at Repton thick pieces of <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> with swirling layered surfaces were possibly made using the cast method.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of Christianity in the early 7th century and the building of ecclesiastical structures the amount of <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> also increased. <b>Window</b> <b>glass,</b> some of which was also coloured, has been identified at more than 17 sites, of which 12 are ecclesiastical. Hundreds of <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> fragments have been found at Jarrow, Wearmouth, Brandon, Whithorn and Winchester. This evidence supports the historical records, such as Bede’s account of Benedict Biscop’s importation of glaziers from Gaul to glaze {{the windows in the}} monastery at Wearmouth in AD 675.|$|E

25|$|Most Anglo-Saxon <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> is thin, durable, bubbly {{and when}} {{colourless}} has a pale bluish-green tint. Many of the ecclesiastical sites have also produced strongly coloured {{glass from the}} 7th century onwards. Analysis of <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> from Beverley, Uley, Winchester, Whithorn, Wearmouth and Jarrow, has revealed that the majority was again a soda-lime-silica glass {{but it has also}} revealed that the composition is different from that of vessel glass, with lower quantities of iron, manganese and titanium suggesting a different source of raw material, possibly from The Levant. The analysis also revealed more about the transition from using soda as a flux, to potash.|$|E

5000|$|A rare {{example of}} an early hybrid system is the {{combination}} of an active IR or ultrasonic auto-focus system with a passive phase-detection system. An IR or ultrasonic system based on timed reflection will work regardless of the light conditions, but can be easily fooled by obstacles like <b>window</b> <b>glasses,</b> and the accuracy is typically restricted to a rather limited number of steps. Phase-detection autofocus [...] "sees" [...] through <b>window</b> <b>glasses</b> without problems and is much more accurate, {{but it does not}} work in low-light conditions or on surfaces without contrasts or with repeating patterns.|$|R

25|$|Glass making: More {{than half}} the {{worldwide}} production of soda ash is used to make glass. Bottle and <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> (Soda-lime glass) is made by melting a mixture of sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate and silica sand (silicon dioxide (SiO2)).|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of complete vessels and assemblages of beads {{come from the}} excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> is found more frequently. This {{is directly related to}} the introduction of Christianity and the construction of churches and monasteries. There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> used in ecclesiastical buildings. Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewellery, both as enamel or as cut glass insets.|$|E
25|$|If medieval glass has flowed perceptibly, then ancient Roman and Egyptian objects {{should have}} flowed proportionately more—but {{this is not}} observed. Similarly, prehistoric {{obsidian}} blades should have lost their edge; this is not observed either (although obsidian may have a different viscosity from <b>window</b> <b>glass).</b>|$|E
50|$|In cities {{throughout}} the Roman Empire, wealthy homeowners lived in buildings with few exterior <b>windows.</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>windows</b> weren't readily available: glass production {{was in its}} infancy. Thus a wealthy Roman citizen lived in a large house separated into two parts, and linked together through the tablinum or study or by a small passageway.|$|R
50|$|On 26 November 2006, a 24-year-old Croatian {{man went}} on a rampage in the Jewish Lauder Chabad School, {{breaking}} <b>windows,</b> <b>glass</b> doors, and showcases with an iron rod. Police later arrested him.|$|R

25|$|Common {{soda lime}} glass is {{partially}} transparent to UVA but is opaque to shorter wavelengths, whereas fused quartz glass, depending on quality, can be transparent even to vacuum UV wavelengths.

50|$|There exists other {{selective}} surfaces {{that are}} not normally used on solar thermal collector surfaces. E.g. low emissivity surfaces used in <b>window</b> <b>glasses,</b> which reflect thermal radiation and has a high transmittance factor (e.g. is transparent) to visible sunlight.|$|R
25|$|During the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion, a fourth-grade {{teacher in}} Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, saved 44 {{children}} from potentially life-threatening ballistic <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks {{when she saw}} the flash. Despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light, she ordered her students to execute a duck and cover drill. Ms. Karbysheva, who herself did not duck and cover but remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the explosion's blast wave arrived, and <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> blew in, severing a tendon in one of her arms; however, not one of her students, who she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered a cut. A follow up study {{of the effects of the}} meteor airburst determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a blast overpressure are those of school buildings, which tend to be large in area.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{expansion}} {{creates a}} pressure differential between the {{warm and cool}} sections, and a crack may form which relieves the stress. In situations where thermal stress cracking has occurred, it can be prevented by using a thicker standard <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> which is structurally stronger and more resistant to cracking, or by using thin toughened glass to increase strength.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time the first window panes are thought to have been produced. The {{earliest}} panes were rough cast into a wooden frame on top of a layer of sand or stone, but from the late 3rd century onwards <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> was made by the muff process, where a blown cylinder was cut laterally and flattened out to produce a sheet.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{developing}} parameters and relationships for selecting a proper <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> applied with film as building envelopes for buildings located in a hot climate based on its thermal performances. Thermal comfort of the occupants sitting near the <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> is the thermal performance {{that needed to be}} considered besides the heat transmission in selecting a proper type of glass to use as a <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> for the building. The predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) is chosen as a thermal comfort index. 45 types of film and 1280 <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> with film are investigated in this study. It can be shown that the thermal comfort index is dependent on the optical properties (total transmittance and total absorptance) and the overall heat transfer coefficient of <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> with film. <b>Glass</b> <b>window</b> with film which has high transmittance shall have more discomfort due to solar radiation effect. <b>Glass</b> <b>window</b> with film which has high absorptance shall have more discomfort due to surface temperature effect. The discomfort from the surface temperature effect for double pane <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> with film is also dependent on the glass thickness other than the absorptance and the change in overall heat transfer coefficient. Expressions for predicting the performance of the <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> with film in terms of thermal comfort are developed...|$|R
