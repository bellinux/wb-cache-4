In a letter to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on 4 December, he said, [...] "Chennai was one of the Indian cities I visited <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> India in 1956 for the Buddha Jayanthi celebrations. Over the years I have visited this beautiful city several times, most recently three weeks ago as these rains began."

2500|$|Pasternak later {{noted on}} a {{photograph}} of himself, [...] "Petőfi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still. I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> know you. Thank you for your help. I was translating both of you." [...] Ivinskaya would later describe the Petőfi translations as, [...] "a first declaration of love." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's strange!" [...] said Janet. [...] "I {{thought there}} was {{somebody}} else <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out. Still, of course, it was nearly dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's nothing," [...] she answered, {{flushing}} awkwardly. [...] "People did {{the same}} for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came,</b> I'd do it for anyone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I {{can find}} him. <b>I</b> seen him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> in, but <b>I</b> can't {{see his face}} because he's hiding behind the prosecuting attorney." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a minute," [...] cried Scraps. [...] "This music thing {{interests}} me. I {{remember to}} have heard music <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> life, and I {{would like to hear}} it again. What is your name, my poor abused phonograph?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you ought}} to break {{yourself}} in at once. Just break the ice and you'll have no further trouble. I remember just how bad I felt <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> New York to look for work. But I'm over it now, thank goodness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you {{remember}} so distinctly what I said about going into the law <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Boston," [...] said her husband angrily, [...] "perhaps you'll remember that I said I shouldn't go to Halleck until I didn't need his help. I shall not go to him for his help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] Sudden {{enlightenment}} {{came upon}} Sally. [...] "That photograph we were hunting for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> here! Had you stolen {{it all the}} time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had that}} turf laid down myself. There were borders there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came,</b> with hollyhocks, and {{those sort of}} things. The turf was an improvement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} done with me yet," [...] she resumed with a smile. [...] "Do you {{remember}} what I said of my errand, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know {{ever and}} ever {{so much more}} than I did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> you, but I guess that after all I know very little of all there is to know," [...] said he shyly, which shows that Peter really had learned a great deal. Then he started for the dear Old Briar-patch, lipperty-lipperty-lip.|$|E
6000|$|LIZA [stopping {{her work}} for a moment] Your calling me Miss Doolittle that day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Wimpole Street. That was the {{beginning}} of self-respect for me. [She resumes her stitching]. And there were a hundred little things you never noticed, because they came naturally to you. Things about standing up and taking off your hat and opening doors-- ...|$|E
60|$|And yet {{you see me}} a {{poor man}} to this day: {{there has been a}} {{persistently}} malignant Fate which has worked against me all these years, and would--but for a happy circumstance of which I hope anon to tell you--have left me just as I was, in the matter of fortune, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Paris and set up in business as a volunteer police agent at No, 96 Rue Daunou.|$|E
6000|$|... "I merely {{glanced in}} there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came,</b> {{for there was}} such a queer lot of women--I'm told he isn't very {{particular}} in that way--that I didn't stay." ...|$|R
2500|$|In that crowded scene, he said, [...] "As I remember, {{there were}} only two {{graduate}} students interested in East Asian studies <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> here: myself and my brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{so pretty}} often <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out," [...] he answered. [...] "In those days, I {{had to work}} in icy water, and carry massive lumps of rock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Severity!' {{said the}} fellow, {{with a kind}} of groan, 'I wish you had had my dreams <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> this dog-hole, and tried to sleep among the dry seaweed. First, there was that d-d fellow there, with his broken back, {{sprawling}} as he did when I hurled the rock over a-top on him, ha, ha! You would have sworn he was lying on the floor where you stand, wriggling like a crushed frog, and then--' ...|$|E
6000|$|Ben Greenway {{bowed his}} head and groaned. [...] "I doubt if Master Bonnet will ever go to the de'il as I feared he would, for now has the de'il come to him. Oh, Dickory, Dickory! this master o' mine was a worthy mon an' a good ane <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> him, an' a' that I hae I owe to him, for I was in sad case, Dickory, very sad case; {{but now that he}} has Apollyon for his teacher, he'll cease to know righteousness altogither." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. I've touched you at last, have I? Because {{you know}} it's true. Don't you {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Chung-king? I was seventeen. My father had {{sent me to}} England to school when I was seven. I never saw him for ten years. And at last he wrote and said I was {{to come back to}} China. You came and met me on the boat and told me my father had had a stroke and was dead. You took me to the Presbyterian mission.|$|E
6000|$|... "None of {{what kind}} at all. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>I</b> made {{experiments}} frequently {{and all the others}} also, but we have always succumbed to the sand which is precipitated upon our heads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Chetwynd kept it up a {{good many}} years, though, I think,' said Lord Darrell. 'I {{remember}} going to see his rooms <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> over. You recollect his pearl fountain of Cologne water?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{beginning}} to understand your attitude toward me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came.</b> You thought <b>I</b> was in the ring--one of the people who, knowing how bad it was, led investors into this rotten scheme!" ...|$|R
60|$|It was winter, as I said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Venice, and my {{experiences}} of the city were not all purely aesthetic. There was, indeed, an every-day roughness and discomfort in the weather, which travelers passing their first winter in Italy {{find it hard to}} reconcile with the habitual ideas of the season's clemency in the South. But winter is apt to be very severe in mild climates. People do not acknowledge it, making a wretched pretense that it is summer only a little out of humor.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a trick Glinda the Sorceress taught me, {{and it is}} {{much better}} magic than I used to {{practice}} in Omaha, or <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Oz," [...] he answered. [...] "When the good Glinda found I was {{to live in the}} Emerald City always, she promised to help me, because she said the Wizard of Oz ought really to be a clever Wizard, and not a humbug. So we have been much together and I am learning so fast that I expect to be able to accomplish some really wonderful things in time." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Rome, I {{felt embarrassed}} {{and unwilling to}} pass, with my heresy, between a devotee and his saint; for they often shoot their prayers at a shrine almost quite across the church. But {{there seems to be}} no {{violation}} of etiquette in so doing. A woman begged of us in the Pantheon, and accused my wife of impiety for not giving her an alms. [...] . People of very decent appearance are often unexpectedly converted into beggars as you approach them; but in general they take a [...] "No" [...] at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's true," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> here <b>I</b> was {{temporarily}} resting, so to speak; but didn't I go {{right out and}} grab the managership of your new hotel? Positively!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When? It {{was hanging}} on its usual nail <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> here this afternoon. I {{remember}} the door being open, and my glancing {{into the room}} casually. I am sure it was there then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{got it in}} {{good working}} order <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> here; but the cannon would speedily shatter that, {{as well as the}} bridge drawn up in front of it and the gate behind it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, don't you see? They commemorate youth, gaiety, brilliant, joyous life. That's {{what that}} kind of statues was made for--to look on at rich, young, {{beautiful}} people and their gallantries; to be danced before by fine ladies and gentlemen playing at shepherd and shepherdesses; to be driven past by marcheses and contessinas flirting in carriages; to be hung with scarfs and wreaths; to be parts of eternal fétes champêtres. Don't you see how bored they look? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Italy I should have detested and ridiculed their bad art; but now they're exquisite--the worse, the better," ...|$|E
60|$|A very, {{very long}} while ago, when I {{used to be}} getting three hundred and fifty rupees a month, and pickings, on a big timber-contract at Calcutta, I had a wife of sorts. But she's dead now. People said that I killed her by taking to the Black Smoke. Perhaps I did, but it's so long since it doesn't matter. Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the Gate, I used {{to feel sorry for}} it; but that's all over and done with long ago, and I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month, and am quite happy. Not DRUNK happy, you know, but always quiet and soothed and contented.|$|E
6000|$|... "No dad, you haven't. You {{have let}} me have my own way too much. You know the proverb: 'Good mothers make bad daughters.' Clodd's right; you've spoilt me, dad. Do you remember, dad, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> you, seven years ago, a ragged little brat out of the streets, that didn't know itself whether 'twas {{a boy or a}} girl? Do you know what I thought to myself the moment I set eyes on you? 'Here's a soft old juggins; I'll be all right if I can get in here!' It makes you smart, {{knocking}} about in the gutters and being knocked about; you read faces quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it, father, I know it," [...] replied Prudence, quickly. [...] "And yet, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> in, my {{eyes were}} so dazzled by the firelight, that {{she seemed to be}} sitting in this very chair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you {{had asked}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> here, <b>I</b> should have said no. I must say now - even at the hazard of {{appearing}} to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your incredulity - yes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{answered}} Winifred, [...] "I {{had several}} reasons. For one thing, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out feeling very forlorn and friendless, it was Wyllard who {{sent me to}} the elevator, and they really treat me very decently." ...|$|R
