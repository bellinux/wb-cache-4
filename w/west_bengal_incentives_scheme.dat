Effective reward and <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> can benefit many organizations if managed properly. In this era of globalization there is need for effective reward and <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> in order to enable organizations respond quickly {{to changes in the}} environment. The paper reviews literature on the effect of effective reward and <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> on organizational performance. The paper concludes that the success of organizations to a very large extent depends on how effective their reward and <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> are. The paper recommends that managers should put in place an effective reward and <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> that sufficiently motivates employees as this could enhance their productivity, responsiveness and commitment to the achievement of the organizational goals. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper first studies how cost padding, {{auditing}} and collusion with auditors {{affect the}} power of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> in procurement and regulation. Unaudited cost padding requires fixed price contracts. <b>Incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> are more powerful under imperfect auditing than under perfect auditing and less powerful than under no auditing. The effect of collusion in auditing on the optimal power of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> is ambiguous; high-powered <b>schemes</b> reduce the <b>incentive</b> for cost padding and thus are less affected by collusion; however, they also yield higher rents and therefore make firms more willing to prevent release of evidence of cost padding. Monitoring of effort, the second topic of this paper, is {{a substitute for the}} use of low-powered <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> to extract the informational rents. It thus enables the regulator to afford more powerful <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes.</b> Collusion in auditing unambiguously lowers {{the power of}} <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> act as {{external}} stimuli. They induce {{workers to}} excel and {{earn more than}} the normal wages. Therefore, well-drafted <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> bring gains to all, i. e., both to the employers and employees. These schemes have universal application, {{in the sense that}} they can be applied in all forms of business organizations, be it big or small, high-tech or labour-intensive, etc., though the structure and complexities of the schemes may vary from a small enterprise to a big enterprise. The present research paper aims to evaluate the labour incentive plans of SSI sector in a selected area. The SSI units are labour-intensive and provide gainful employment to lakhs of low-educated, unskilled and semi-skilled workers. The operational efficiency of these units depend on the efficiency rate of their employees. In view of this, <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> become essential. The study looks at the existence, structure and cost of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> in Hubli-Dharwad area of Karnataka State. The study finds that <b>incentives</b> <b>schemes</b> are yet to make serious inroads into SSI sector and only 68 percent of surveyed units employ them. The schemes employed are simple, monetary and individual-oriented in nature. The cost of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> does not exceed 5 percent of total labour cost in majority of units employing such schemes. The study also finds that there is no statistical relationship between educational qualification level of entrepreneurs and the adoption of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> but the educational level becomes important in deciding the structure of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes.</b> The study concludes by providing some useful suggestions for the adoption and operation of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> in SSI sector...|$|R

40|$|Whether or not {{financial}} <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> help organisations {{to reach}} their objectives is an old debate. During the last few decades, the modern management schools -Total Quality Management (TQM) and new manufacturing techniques-added extra pressure on financial <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> by claiming that such schemes don't fit in a modern management environment {{and that they can}} have a destructive influence on organisations. Although the advocates of TQM and modern manufacturing management techniques have different views concerning financial <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes,</b> generally speaking, they don't believe that these schemes help modern organisations {{to reach their}} objectives. Some of these advocates see that financial <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> motivate employees to focus on quantity and ignore quality. Others see that although those schemes can help to achieve progress, that progress is {{at the expense of the}} intrinsic rewards that organisations should promote. Other TQM advocates believe that these schemes do not help because effective and efficient systems rather than individuals are the main factor that determines the progress of organisations. This category believes that it makes more sense to improve the systems and procedures rather than to use financial <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> to motivate employees to reach the organisations' targets. The purpose of this research project was to answer the question as to whether a compromise between TQM and financial <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> could be achieved to make the best use of both approaches. To answer this question an organisation with a strong TQM environment was identified and a financial <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> was designed and implemented in that organisation with the help of a design team from the same organisation. The scheme covered five main areas of interest to the organisation namely: product and process quality, manufacturing management, environmental compliance, safety compliance and cost effectiveness. From several key performance indicators (KPIs) used by the organisation in these five areas only those under the direct control of employees were used in this research project. Samples of employees from the departments covered by the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> were consulted all through the different stages of the development of the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme.</b> A comprehensive communication plan was undertaken to ensure that the structure and principles of the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> were clearly communicated to all employees. The results of installing the financial <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> were then analysed to study the effect of implementing that scheme on the organisational performance and on the TQM environment and particularly on some specific TQM attributes. The analysis of those results showed that the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> achieved a considerable improvement in almost all of the areas covered by the scheme. The analysis showed no evidence of any adverse effect on the TQM environment as a result of installing the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme.</b> In fact it was concluded that the TQM environment assisted the implementation of the financial <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme...</b>|$|R

Yet, autonomous devices tend to abstain from cooperation in order to save their own resources. <b>Incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> have been proposed as a means of fostering cooperation under these circumstances. In order to work e#ectively, <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> need to be carefully tailored to the characteristics of the cooperation protocol they should support.

Three hypotheses are developed, based on a review of transfer pricing, budget-goal setting, incentive, and auditing literatures. Experimental data are gathered over multiple periods of negotiations from forty-eight students, and are analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA. The outcome measured is firm profits. The results show that bonus <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> and audit threats have no effect on firm profits. However, the interaction between the performance based bonus <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> and an audit threat is significant. With both management controls, bonus incentive and audit threats, firm profits are significantly lower than under a bonus <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> only. Possible reasons for these results are explored in the discussion section.

30|$|Associated with {{behavioral}} uncertainty, an essential requisite centers on synthesizing how <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> affect partner trust. It {{can be established}} that <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> influence partner trust depending a degree of fairness partners perceive. Unfair allocation of incentives can increase trust uncertainties because of suspiciousness and rivalry in unseen returns. Conversely, upon realizing fairness in the sharing of pains and gains by means of evenhanded negotiations [54, 57], trust can be promoted. Therefore, considering <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme,</b> three criteria “costs allocation” [48, 49, 57], “savings allocation” [38, 49], and “risks allocation” [42, 49] are formalized.|$|R

40|$|In ad hoc networks, devices must {{cooperate}} {{in order to}} compensate for the absence of infrastructure. Yet, autonomous devices are free to decide whether to cooperate or not. Hence, incentives are indispensable to induce cooperation between autonomous devices. Recently, several <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> have been proposed.

In this paper, we demonstrate the ine#ectiveness of such isolated <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> and point out the need for vertical integration.

40|$|A central {{tenet of}} {{economics}} {{is that people}} respond to incentives. While an appropriately crafted <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> can achieve the second-best optimum {{in the presence of}} moral hazard, the principal must be very well informed about the environment (e. g. the agent’s preferences and the production technology) in order to achieve this. Indeed it is often suggested that <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> can be gamed by an agent with superior knowledge of the environment, and furthermore that lack of transparency {{about the nature of the}} <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> can reduce gaming. We pro-vide a formal theory of these phenomena. We show that ambiguous <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> induce more balanced efforts from an agent who performs multiple tasks and who is better informed about the environment than the principal is. On the other hand, such ambiguous schemes impose more risk on the agent per unit of effort induced. By identifying settings in which am-biguous schemes are especially effective in inducing balanced efforts, we show that, if tasks are sufficiently complementary for the principal, ambiguous <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> can dominate the best deterministic scheme and can even completely eliminate the efficiency losses from the agent’s better knowledge of the environment.
