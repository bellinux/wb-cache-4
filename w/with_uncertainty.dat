5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston <b>with</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and were {{determined}} to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} December 2008, Keenan had {{mentioned}} that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new material for A Perfect Circle, although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of {{the view of the}} public through mid-2010. On September 2010, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums - Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive - notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but <b>with</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material {{was in a state of}} flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{failed to}} extend his {{authority}} to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him, apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case. According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine <b>with</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part. In 603, Augustine and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their people, who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on {{the entrance of the}} British bishops, they refused to recognise him as their archbishop. There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised. Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops. Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.|$|E

5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings {{on the third}} morning. The Australian openers took a {{cautious}} approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that {{were not going to}} hit the stumps, looking for a solid start. Both openers were given early reprieves. Barnes survived a stumping opportunity when he was 18. Laker came on and induced Morris into hitting an airborne ball back down the pitch, but he was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers {{would have been able to}} reach the ball and attempt a catch. The openers took advantage to combine for an opening stand of 122. Wright came on and again bowled a no ball at the start of his spell, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. After shuffling around <b>with</b> <b>uncertainty</b> at the start of his innings, Morris began to play more fluently. He was eventually bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. The opening partnership laid the platform for Australia's 7/460 declared, which allowed them to set an imposing target of 596 and win by 409 runs to take a 20 series lead.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} way to capture the dynamic characteristics of structural systems <b>with</b> <b>uncertainties</b> {{has been an important}} and challenging subject. While such characterization is valuable for structural response predictions, it could be impractical in many application situations where a sufficiently large sample is expensive or unavailable. In this paper, Gaussian process regression models are employed to capture structural dynamical responses, especially responses <b>with</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> When Gaussian processes are used to make predictions for responses <b>with</b> <b>uncertainties,</b> the sampling costs can be significantly reduced because only a relatively small set of data points is needed. With no loss of generality, applications of Gaussian process regression models are introduced in conjunction with Monte Carlo sampling. This approach can be easily generalized to situations where data points are obtained by other sampling techniques. ...|$|R
