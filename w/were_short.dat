5|$|Gabriel García Márquez {{started out}} as a {{journalist}} and has written many acclaimed non-fiction and short stories; his earliest published writings <b>were</b> <b>short</b> stories which appeared in Bogotá's El Espectador newspaper in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{the rural}} {{background}} of most men, the initial camps provided soil conservation and farming-related projects. By August 1945, 550 men worked on dairy farms and with milk testing. Labor-intensive farming operations like dairies <b>were</b> <b>short</b> {{of workers and}} accepted COs to help fill the gap. Men assigned to the Bureau of Reclamation built contours to prevent soil erosion, constructed 164 reservoirs and 249 dams. A sixth of all CPS work was performed in this area.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, the {{director}} of the marketing department of the Games, Fang Da’er, claimed that the Games <b>were</b> <b>short</b> of funds, due to lack of sponsorship and the global financial crisis. An informal estimate put the Games' expenditure at about US$420 million and revenue at US$450 million.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the named storms, the MFR tracked seven tropical disturbances and two tropical depressions throughout the year. Most <b>were</b> <b>short</b> lived, often receiving few warnings. The first two systems developed before Tropical Storm Antoinette in October.|$|E
5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted {{he remembers the}} episode for several scenes in which the action is viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean. The animators <b>were</b> <b>short</b> on time, so {{for the design of}} Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African-American.|$|E
5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones <b>were</b> <b>short</b> and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side}} of the skull, was broad. The bony palate was long and flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E

5|$|Portus Abonae was a Roman port at {{the mouth}} which {{provided}} an embarkation point for journeys across the River Severn to South Wales. In the 18th century there <b>were</b> <b>short</b> lived attempts at creating a port and a whale fishery here. The name Trym appears to have Anglo-Saxon roots. In recent years silting problems, caused by urban development have caused some difficulties, but alleviation works have helped reduce the problem.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but they too <b>were</b> <b>short</b> on {{supplies}} {{and in the end}} they were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of {{the neck}} had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae of the back had centra (or bodies) that <b>were</b> <b>short</b> relative to their width, and their neural spines <b>were</b> <b>short</b> and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs {{of the last four}} back vertebrae were fused to them, and the ribcage was very broad {{in this part of the}} body. The ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The caudal vertebrae of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) of the caudal vertebrae formed a U-shape when seen from above, instead of the more usual V-shape.|$|E

50|$|When a form {{stands alone}} as a present-day word, {{it is usually}} a {{telescopic}} abbreviation: bio biography, chemo chemotherapy, hydro hydroelectricity, metro metropolitan. Some telescoped forms can <b>be</b> <b>shorter</b> than the original classical compounds: gynie <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than gyneco- and stands for both gynecology and gynecologist; anthro <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than anthropo- and stands for anthropology.|$|R
5000|$|The {{anterior}} {{sections of}} the radular tooth <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than the posterior section, and the blade <b>is</b> <b>short.</b> The waist and corresponding waist fold are obvious. A basal spur is present, and the barb <b>is</b> <b>short.</b> A shaft fold is present. (Similar to Dalliconus, however the species of Fusiconus {{do not have a}} posterior blade.) ...|$|R
5|$|The dogs of {{all these}} islands <b>were</b> <b>short,</b> and their sizes vary {{from that of a}} lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} his first novel was {{published}} Maugham began contributing to magazines and periodicals; initially these <b>were</b> <b>short</b> stories, but he also wrote opinion pieces, non-fictional and autobiographical work, and letters. Much of his non-fictional writing was published in book form, and covered a range of topics, including travel, current affairs, autobiography and belles lettres. Maugham was also editor {{on a number of}} works, which often included adding a preface or introductory chapter to the work of other writers. In 1903 his first play was performed, A Man of Honour at the Imperial Theatre, London. It was the first of many of his works that were produced for the stage, and with the later development of cinema, his novels and stories were also adapted for the big screen.|$|E
5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours <b>were</b> <b>short,</b> lasting only three months.|$|E
50|$|The {{globular}} head bears large {{eyes with}} large facets. Three ocelli are present. The two-jointed antennae <b>are</b> <b>short.</b> The vertical, rigid proboscis <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than the head.|$|R
50|$|Social: In lizards, FID <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> during social {{encounters}} {{than when}} they were solitary. and FID <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> in female lizards when they were interacting with males {{than when they}} were alone; it <b>was</b> also <b>shorter</b> in males interacting with either sex.|$|R
30|$|The {{amplitude}} of the PI is larger when the rise time <b>is</b> <b>shorter.</b> This <b>is</b> {{consistent with the}} relationship between the rise time and {{amplitude of}} the DL, and the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL because the effective length of the PI, i.e., the dynamo region, <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL. Also, the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> at an enhanced speed than at an enhanced density. It is therefore suggested that a high-speed solar wind is needed to create a rapid magnetic variation.|$|R
5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews <b>were</b> <b>short</b> and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately {{set the tone for}} almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings <b>were</b> <b>short</b> and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws <b>were</b> <b>short,</b> rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
50|$|The Tweeling Sisters (11) - Zeni and Nadi Tweeling are {{a pair of}} {{conjoined}} twin sisters with opposing personalities. Zeni <b>is</b> <b>short</b> for Zenith and Nadi <b>is</b> <b>short</b> for Nadir.|$|R

50|$|The {{anterior}} {{section of}} the radula is much longer than the posterior section. The blade <b>is</b> <b>short,</b> a basal spur is absent, and the barb <b>is</b> <b>short.</b> The radular tooth has no serrations. An accessory process is present and <b>is</b> a <b>short,</b> simple triangular terminating cusp.|$|R
5|$|From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but <b>were</b> <b>short</b> of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, in 1902, Scott, {{a native}} commissioner, brought to Clarke's {{attention}} that many work-seekers were suffering great privation yet {{were unable to}} find work while some businesses <b>were</b> <b>short</b> of labour. Clarke took up the cause: 'This indicates the necessity of the organisation of an Association for bringing those wanting labour and those seeking employment into contact and prevent, what I have myself seen, gangs of destitute natives wandering about the country.' In 1903, a Rhodesian Native Labour Bureau was proposed.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, the arms and hands of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, {{even more so than}} that of Ceratosaurus. The first finger was smaller than the other fingers and lacked digits entirely. As for the other fingers, the second finger was very robust and had three digits, the third finger only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods, and the preserved portions of the fourth finger indicate that it was comparatively long and slender, terminating in a single digit. The claws <b>were</b> <b>short,</b> stout, and expanded at their base.|$|E
