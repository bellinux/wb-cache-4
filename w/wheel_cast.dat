500|$|A {{widening}} in {{the modern}} river, close to the dismantled Midhurst branch of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, marks the site of Ladymead Lock, with a weir {{to the south and}} the lock structure to the north. The fourth lock was Coultershaw Lock. The river at this point runs to the south, and there was a large meander to the west with a weir at its head. The mill stream ran to the east, and the lock was built just {{to the west of the}} mill. Coultershaw Bridge now carries the A285 road over the mill stream, near which is Coultershaw Beam Pump; it was built in 1782 to provide a better water supply to Petworth House. The pump is powered by a water <b>wheel,</b> <b>cast</b> at Cocking Foundry, which is [...] in diameter. There were two corn mills and a malt mill recorded on the site in 1534. The mill was modernised in 1910, when turbines replaced the wheels, and standby engines were installed in 1919. It was destroyed by fire in 1923, and a steel-framed concrete building replaced it. When it ceased to operate in 1972, the building was demolished, but the beam pump, which was located beneath the building, was rescued and has been restored. The pump no longer performs its original function, but supplies a fountain near the visitor centre.|$|E

50|$|Frettenham Mill is a five storey tower mill {{which had}} a stage at second floor level. The cap was winded by a fantail. The mill had four sails. The tower is 47 ft to the curb. Much of the {{machinery}} survives in the converted mill, including the wooden upright shaft, wooden clasp-arm great spur <b>wheel,</b> <b>cast</b> iron crown wheel with wooden teeth and two pairs of underdrift French Burr millstones. One of the millstones was incorporated into the village sign.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{into account}} their {{generally}} inferior quality compared to forged wheels, the main advantage of <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> is {{the relatively low}} cost of production. And although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are more affordable than forged <b>wheels,</b> <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are designed to be}} heavier than forged wheels for a given required load. Manufacturing defects found in <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> include cavities or porosity and a different metallurgical microstructure, entailing larger grain size. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheels</b> will tend to fracture upon overbearing high-speed impact, whereas forged wheels will tend to bend.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{water wheel}} was made entirely of wood but was replaced in {{the mid-19th century}} by an iron <b>wheel</b> <b>cast</b> at the Chorley Iron Foundry at Cocking. The present wheel has two cast iron spiders with hexagonal centres fixed to a wrought iron shaft. The spiders are 8 ft in diameter with oak paddles 16 in deep by 4 ft wide, making the overall diameter of the wheel 11 ft. The alignment between the crankshaft and the waterwheel shaft was not very accurate; to reduce friction, the bearings between the wheel and the pump were left loose. When operating, the pump was very noisy and the clatter could be heard throughout the mill building. Since it has been restored, a flexible coupling has been inserted between the two shafts, thus {{reducing the amount of}} clatter.|$|E

30|$|The LPDC {{machine unit}} {{employed}} {{here is a}} vertical cold chamber die <b>casting</b> unit. The <b>wheel</b> <b>casting</b> {{coming out of the}} LPDC unit is quenched in water and is sent for checking internal casting defects in the non-destructive x-ray checking machine. After non-destructive x-ray check, the alloy <b>wheel</b> <b>casting</b> then follows the gate-cutting process, heat treatment, shot-blasting, CNC machining and air-leak testing. After air-leak test depending on the product requirement the alloy wheel is either sent to the paint line or sent to the Chrome Plating Plant. The paint line mainly consists of degreasing the machined alloy wheel, deoxidizing, conversion coating, pre-heating in dry-off oven, color coating and packing and dispatch. On the other hand, the machined wheels entering the Chrome Plating Plant are subjected to rigorous surface finish improvement by buffing operation. After this it enters the chrome plating process which consists of the copper plating line followed by chrome plating line.|$|R

A {{modified}} Cellular Automaton {{model was}} presented to simulate the evolution of dendritic microstructure in {{low pressure die casting}} of Al-Si Alloy, which accounted for the heterogeneous nucleation, the solute redistribution both in liquid and solid, the interface curvature and the growth anisotropy during solidification. The free growth of single equiaxed dendrite and the evolution of multi dendrites with various crystallographic orientations were predicted. The variation of the dendrite tip velocity and local solute concentration at the solid/liquid interface were analyzed.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the possibilities of}} using optical measurements for defining the geometric accuracy of gear <b>wheels</b> <b>casts</b> manufactured in the rapid prototyping process. The tested gear <b>wheel</b> prototype was <b>cast</b> using an aluminum alloy.

The aim of the tests was to determine the geometric accuracy of the cast made by the ZCast technology in the rapid prototyping process. The tests were conducted with the use of the coordinate optical measuring method and a GOM measuring device. The prototype measurements were made in the scanning mode. The results of the measurements, saved in the STL format with the use of the scanning device software, were compared with the gear wheel 3 D-CAD nominal model. The measurements enabled the determination of the real accuracy of prototypes manufactured in casting moulds by means of the ZCast technology. The selection of the measuring method was also analyzed in terms of measurement accuracy and the RP technology precision...|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{wheels are}} made to cope with radial and axial forces. They also provide a way of {{mounting}} other critical components such as the brakes, final drive and suspension. Wheels, and anything directly connected to them, {{are considered to be}} unsprung mass. Traditionally motorcycles used spoked wheels with inner tubes and pneumatic tyres. Although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> were first used on a motorcycle in 1927, it would not be until the 1970s that mainstream manufacturers would start to introduce <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> on their roadgoing motorcycles. Spoked wheels are usually made with steel spokes and steel or aluminium rims. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are predominantly made from aluminium or an alloy of, but can also be made from more exotic materials such as magnesium or carbon fibre.|$|R

There are a number of refiners for the foundry industry used industrially or mentioned in the literature. A programme of laboratory tests has been carried out, which started with a pre-screening of a wide range of potential refiners, using standard laboratory grain refining tests. The better performing refiners were then tested in a permanent mould casting, designed to simulate conditions at the spoke-rim junction of a <b>wheel</b> <b>casting.</b> Results are presented in terms of the effect of refiner on grain size, hot tearing and porosity distribution.
