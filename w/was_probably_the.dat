5|$|Barbara (Benedicta) Fitzroy (1672–1737) – She <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{child of}} John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough, who was another of Cleveland's many lovers, {{and was never}} {{acknowledged}} by Charles as his own daughter.|$|E
5|$|David {{was born}} on a date unknown in 1084 in Scotland. He <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> eighth son of King Malcolm III, and {{certainly}} the sixth and youngest born by Malcolm's second wife, Margaret of Wessex. He was the grandson of the ill-fated King Duncan I.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} to Gormlaith ingen Flann mac Conaing, King of Brega, a key ally of his stepfather, <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first. Known children of this marriage are Donnchad Donn, later King of Mide and of Tara, and Gormlaith.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Conrad of Abenberg {{came from}} {{the family of the}} Counts of Abenberg-Frensdorf, and had many {{distinguished}} relatives in Germany. He was born around 1075, son of Count Wolfram I von Abenberg. His mother <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> daughter of Heinrich I, viscount of Regensburg. Conrad had two older brothers, Otto and Wolfram. He was raised for a clerical career at the court of the Emperor Henry IV, where {{he was a member of}} the court chapel. He became a canon in Hildesheim.|$|E

5|$|Eustathios' sons Pothos and Leo {{would go}} on to hold senior {{military}} commands, including the post of Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief). Another son, Romanos, is known only from his participation in the Battle of Achelous in 917. Leo Argyros married a daughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944), and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> grandfather or great-grandfather of Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028–1034).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter {{was elected by}} the Dunblane cathedral chapter {{to be the new}} bishop. On his election, Walter possessed no benefices in the diocese, and had had none since giving up his Abernethy prebend a decade before. However, it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> diocese of his birth, and he had almost become archdeacon of the diocese in 1345.|$|E
5|$|Giganotosaurus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> apex {{predator}} in its ecosystem. It shared {{its environment}} with herbivorous dinosaurs {{such as the}} titanosaurian sauropod Andesaurus, and the rebbachisaurid sauropods Limaysaurus and Nopcsaspondylus. Other theropods include the abelisaurid Ekrixinatosaurus, the dromaeosaurid Buitreraptor, and the alvarezsaurid Alnashetri. Other reptiles include the crocodyliform Araripesuchus, sphenodontians, snakes, and the turtle Prochelidella. Other vertebrates include cladotherian mammals, a pipoid frog, and ceratodontiform fishes. Footprints indicate the presence of large ornithopods and pterosaurs as well.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Roskilde became a market town but it was {{certainly}} enjoying trading privileges under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268. By that time, it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> largest and most important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Its lengthy {{period of}} {{visibility}} and extensive {{coverage in the}} media meant that Hale–Bopp <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most-observed comet in history, making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of Halley's Comet in 1986, and certainly seen by {{a greater number of}} people than witnessed any of Halley's previous appearances. For instance, 69% of Americans had seen Hale–Bopp by April 9, 1997.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{established}} {{a close relationship}} with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> second most-powerful person in the country after the prime minister, although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had been imposed upon them. MacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces, and in August 1942 selected Major General George C. Kenney to replace him. Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's troops would prove crucial.|$|E

5|$|Pteranodon was {{notable for}} its skull crest, though the {{function}} of this crest has been a subject of debate. Most explanations {{have focused on the}} blade-like, backward pointed crest of male P. longiceps, however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.|$|E
5|$|Ragnvald's {{maternal}} grandfather, Ónæmr, {{is mentioned}} on two additional runestones in Uppland, U 328 and U 336. Runestone U 328 relates that Ragnvaldr had two aunts, Gyríðr and Guðlaug. Additionally, runestone U 336 adds that Ulf of Borresta, who received three Danegelds in England, was Ónæm's paternal nephew and thus Ragnvald's first cousin. He <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> same Ragnvaldr whose death is related in the Hargs bro runic inscriptions, which would also connect him to Estrid and the wealthy Jarlabanke clan.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first time anyone had been tested {{for the presence of}} 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme has been seen {{as one of the most}} popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land (1922). The final line of the verse <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Davenant of the Duke's Company {{staged a}} 1662 {{adaptation}} in which Henry Harris played Romeo, Thomas Betterton Mercutio, and Betterton's wife Mary Saunderson Juliet: she <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{first woman to}} play the role professionally. Another version closely followed Davenant's adaptation and was also regularly performed by the Duke's Company. This was a tragicomedy by James Howard, in which the two lovers survive.|$|E
