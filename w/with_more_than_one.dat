5|$|According to Pauling's first rule, {{successive}} pK {{values of}} a given acid increase (pKa2 > pKa1).

40|$|The author {{presents}} an expression {{for determining the}} minimum possible length of binary sequences <b>with</b> "not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> coincidence" property. Obtained low bound length value allows quantitatively estimating efficiency of any known synthesis methods for creation of binary sequences <b>with</b> "not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> coincidence" property. The efficiency of known methods of creating binary sequences based on extended Galois fields theory is analyzed by comparing the obtained sequences length with a theoretical low bound estimation. The paper shows high performance of the known methods of creation of sequences <b>with</b> "not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> coincidence" property based on extended Galois fields...|$|R

5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> male when she is in heat, {{with the result that}} different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|On the Continent, {{particularly}} Germany, crests have a {{far greater}} significance than in Britain, and {{it is common for}} one person to display multiple crests with his arms; certain high-ranking noblemen are entitled to as many as seventeen. This practice did not exist in Britain until the modern era, and arms <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> crest are still rare. In contrast to Continental practice, where a crest is never detached from its helm, a Briton <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> crest may choose to display only one crested helm, and have the other crests simply floating in space. Though usually adopted through marriage to an heiress, examples exist of secondary crests being granted as augmentations: after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, Robert Ross was granted, in addition to his original crest, the crest of an arm holding the US flag with a broken flagstaff.|$|E

5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} mating <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.|$|E
5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} {{by the time}} they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> male when she is in heat.|$|E

5|$|Reproduction {{is one of}} the {{few times}} the Sunda slow loris {{aggregates}} with conspecifics, as it is largely solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six; this appeared to be a female in estrus and five males following her. This may suggest a more promiscuous mating system, where females mate <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> male. Despite this, its testis size is small compared with similar sized promsimians, which is indicative of monogamy. In the wild the mating system of the Sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations.|$|E
