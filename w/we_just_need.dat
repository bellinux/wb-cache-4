So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again." ...|$|E

Hall said that [...] "We [...] attach identities to people, saying, 'It’s too late to reach this person,' or 'This person here, there’s still some good there, so we should try on this one,' or 'This one’s a lost cause, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> {{to get him out of}} here'. That’s a scary place to live if you’re that person — if you didn’t make the church’s 'list'".|$|E

In September 2016, {{discussing}} the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, [...] "You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, {{we will continue to}} move forward." [...] Jed Whedon added, [...] "There are always ideas {{in the back of your}} mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet." [...] By May 2017, Bell noted they had [...] "a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly."

500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Carruthers scored for {{the first}} time in 2005–06 with the winning goal in a 1–0 victory away to Grimsby Town on 10 December 2005 after scoring from a free kick on 80 minutes. He played {{regularly}} after signing permanently, appearing in 45 matches and scoring once in his first full season at the club. Ahead of 2006–07, Carruthers said [...] "We've got a good set of players and have proved that – especially away against some of the top sides. We're capable of getting results; <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to get that consistency". He played in an FA Cup fourth round match against Championship team Derby County on 27 January 2007, in which he cleared an Arturo Lupoli header off the line, although Rovers lost 1–0. He played in both legs of Rovers' play-off semi-final victory over Lincoln City, which finished 7–4 on aggregate. He played in the 2007 League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 26 May 2007, which Rovers won 3–1 against Shrewsbury Town, thus earning promotion to League One. He finished the season with 54 appearances and agreed a new one-year contract with the club in July 2007.|$|E
500|$|White was {{recalled}} to the Australian ODI and Twenty20 squads for the 2008 {{tour of the}} West Indies. He scored 10runs off 6balls in a rain-reduced 11-over Twenty20 contest, and in a 50-over tour {{match against}} University of West Indies Vice-Chancellor's XI, made 34 but remained wicket-less in his eight overs with the ball. By this stage in his career, White was generally considered a middle-order batsman who bowled a bit, but Australia captain Ponting saw {{his place in the}} team as that of the front-line spinner. [...] "White's obviously been picked as the spinner on this tour. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to keep exposing him to different situations and putting him under a bit more pressure. Hopefully he plays a big role for us during the series." [...] Despite Ponting's comments, he used White as the fourth-change bowler in the first ODI, bringing the slow left-arm spin of Michael Clarke on first. White conceded 32runs in his six overs without a breakthrough, and did not bowl at all in the second match, as Clarke claimed the man of the match award for his half-century and three wickets. [...] Although White scored 40* at quicker than a run a ball, the return of Andrew Symonds for the last three ODIs left White out of the team again.|$|E

[...] Volpe also argued that Canada should return to a peacekeeping ethos in foreign affairs, rather than primarily engaging in combat missions. [...] After the party's first all-candidates debate, he accused frontrunner Michael Ignatieff of echoing the foreign policy vision of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.|$|E

He also described the new material as being [...] "very reminiscent of Frizzle Fry". In May, {{it was revealed that}} the album was complete and had been named Green Naugahyde, though the release date was pushed back to July to avoid the holidays. On June 6, a press release was issued announcing that the album would be released by ATO Records and Prawn Song on September 13, 2011. A second press release was later issued announcing that the album would be released in Europe on September 12. On August 17, the track [...] "Tragedy's a' Comin'" [...] was made available to stream via the Spin magazine website, followed by [...] "HOINFODAMAN" [...] on September 1 via the Rolling Stone site.

Hines stated, [...] "It {{was a game}} {{we believed}} in, but we never felt that it got to where {{it needed to be}} –– we never saw a path to success if we finished it. It wasn't up to our quality standard, and we decided to cancel it. It’s no longer in development. That wasn't an easy decision, but it’s one that won’t surprise many folks given that we hadn't been talking about it. Human Head Studios is no longer working on it. It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to see what that something is." [...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011.

Somehow, we didn’t think that was enough: we didn’t want to do a period piece, we wanted to make it contemporary. That was the whole concept of ‘Top Secret!’: that it was not necessarily grounded in reality, but it would have kind of this heightened sense of craziness - even to which genres we were picking, which was a split hybrid between Elvis movies and the World War II movies.|$|R
