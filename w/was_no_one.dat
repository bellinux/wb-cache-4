5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Caracalla's death, Adventus was selected to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age. The army then chose Macrinus; they had no feelings of 'love or esteem' towards him, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else competing for the position. The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla, and named him Augustus.|$|E
5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet {{until the end of the}} war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E

5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he found that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When {{he was about to}} return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.|$|E
5|$|The major revolt {{began on}} September 20, 1260. It was {{triggered}} by the Lithuanian and Samogitian military victory against the joint forces of the Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Durbe. As the uprising was spreading through Prussian lands, each clan chose a leader: the Sambians were led by Glande, the Natangians by Herkus Monte, the Bartians by Diwanus, the Warmians by Glappe, the Pogesanians by Auktume. One clan that did not join the uprising was the Pomesanians. The uprising was also supported by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians. However, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> leader to coordinate efforts of these different forces. Herkus Monte, who was educated in Germany, became the best known and most successful of the leaders, but he commanded only his Natangians.|$|E

There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E

5|$|Hagerstrom {{was then}} sent to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and Pinnnelas City Air Base in Florida, flying the Bell P-39 Airacobra and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk with the 20th Pursuit Group. In late September he was posted to the 8th Fighter Squadron (8th FS) of the 49th Operations Group and sent to San Francisco, California. After staying at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, he and forty other {{personnel}} moved on to Fort Mason, where sailed to Hawaii along with 1,500 other soldiers. They did not stay long, however, and set sail again, this time flanked by a naval task force. After an overnight stop at Suva, Fiji, they landed at their destination of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Initially there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> there and nothing to do until Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, the commander of Fifth Fighter Command, organized a refresher session for the new pilots at Charters Towers Airport. In April1943, he and the P-40-equipped 8th FS relocated to Dobodura Airfield Complex in New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, {{he was promoted to}} first lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E
5|$|Senior {{officers}} of the army also met {{the leaders of the}} political parties and called on them to form the transitional government, but added that the army would control the defence and interior ministries. The meeting was also attended by: Indjai, who was later arrested; the deputy chief-of-staff General Mamadu Ture Kuruma; the heads of the army, air force and navy; the army's spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Daha Bana na Walna and four colonels; however there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> from the incumbent PAIGC. Consultations with 23 parliamentary and extra-parliamentary parties discussed issues such as: a transitional government including, an interim president and head of the National Assembly, as well as a PAIGC-nominated prime minister other than the incumbent and a government of national unity inclusive of all parties; and the dissolution of the National Assembly with a government led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) under interim leadership.|$|E

5|$|Slavas draft had {{increased}} {{too much to}} allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and Vormsi (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the February Revolution had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a shoal southeast of the channel because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and Slava settled on the shallow bottom with a hole on the starboard side near the funnel. She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the Estonians.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} drain of the Imjin War in Korea {{against the}} Japanese {{was one of}} the many problems – fiscal or other – facing Ming China during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572–1620). In the beginning of his reign, Wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs. His Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (1572–82) built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials. However, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances; officials soon banded together in opposing political factions. Over time Wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers, preferring to stay behind the walls of the Forbidden City and out of his officials' sight. Scholar-officials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials; any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor.|$|E
5|$|The warfare {{with the}} Prussians relied on guerilla raids {{in the border}} regions. Small groups of men, a dozen to a hundred, made quick raids on farms, villages, border posts, etc. This was a {{positional}} warfare where neither side could defeat the other, but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe, while Prussians were draining their local resources. After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Krücken in 1249, the Knights refused {{to negotiate with the}} Prussians. The Prussians were also unable to coordinate their efforts and develop a common strategy: while each clan had its own leader, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to lead all the clans. The Natangians had to watch for attacks from Balga, Brandenburg, Wehlau, and Königsberg while the Warmians were threatened by garrisons at Christburg and Elbing. This way only Diwane and his Bartians were able to continue the war in the west. They made several minor expeditions to Culmerland each year.|$|E

5|$|As at 31 December 2010, the {{remuneration}} of ministers depended on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package {{was made up}} of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a special allowance of one month's salary, and a public service leadership allowance of two months' salary) and variable components (an annual variable component, a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual variable component of up to one and a half month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP bonus depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 salary, and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.|$|E
