2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>observed</b> that tithes {{are due to}} the parson {{of common}} right, unless by special exemption: let us {{therefore}} see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.|$|E
2500|$|Einstein {{stated that}} the theory of {{relativity}} belongs to a class of [...] "principle-theories". As such, it employs an analytic method, {{which means that the}} elements of this theory are not based on hypothesis but on empirical discovery. By observing natural processes, we understand their general characteristics, devise mathematical models to describe what <b>we</b> <b>observed,</b> and by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and match the theory's conclusions.|$|E

EqtII activity is known {{to depend on the}} presence of sphingomyelin in the target membrane and is enhanced by lipid phase separation.

2500|$|... "Because almost 25% of the treatment-seeking {{population}} {{carries the}} Asp40 allele, genetic testing of individuals before naltrexone treatment {{might be worth}} the cost and effort, especially if structured behavioral treatment were not being considered." [...] This would enable treatment to be targeted by genetics to patients for whom it would be most effective. They noted, [...] "Naltrexone {{is relatively easy to}} administer and free of serious adverse effects and, as <b>we</b> <b>observed</b> in the Asp40 carriers we studied, it appears to be highly effective." ...|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>observe</b> that as {{selling price}} (s) increases, {{the total cost}} decreases.
