40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to analyze the {{modified}} physical properties of an educational resource for facilitating the handling of a child <b>with</b> dyskinetic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy.</b> The participant of the study was a six year old child <b>with</b> dyskinetic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> enrolled in a regular early childhood education classroom. The educational resource that was selected was a brick game, in which the physical properties of weight, size and texture had been modified. The analysis was made regarding the quality of upper limb movement to the variables: righting index, scalar displacement (s), average speed (As) and time (t). The results showed that combined large size and heavy weight did not have a satisfactory outcome, affecting both grasping the educational resource and fitting. There was also inconsistency in children <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy's</b> responses. There is variation in the results, though a standard cannot be established. Thus, this study contributed to understanding the motor responses of a child <b>with</b> dyskinetic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> when participating in a fitting activity with educational resources in which the physical properties had been modified...|$|R

5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and basic problems in mentally retarded children which can form the basis of their behavior is impairment in social adjustment and performance. The purpose of the present work was to study the effect of 8 weeks aerobic training on the social adjustment in mentally retarded children <b>with</b> hemiplegic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy.</b> The statistical population included all mentally retarded children <b>with</b> hemiplegic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> in District 1 of Tehran who were under the coverage of Exceptional Education Organization in 2013 - 2014 academic year. Among 38 mentally retarded children, 24 (with a mean age of 9 ± 2 years) were randomly selected and divided into two groups: experimental and the control groups. To assess the social adjustment, Vineland Adjustment Behavior Scale (VABS) (1984) was used. Quasi-experimental method with pretest and posttest design and a control group was used for this research. The findings showed that 8 weeks aerobic exercises could increase the social adjustment in children <b>with</b> hemiplegic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> (P≤ 0. 001). Finally, it can be concluded that aerobic exercises {{have a positive impact on}} the social adjustment in children <b>with</b> hemiplegic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> by increasing their communication with peers...|$|R
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
25|$|In this classification, skiers <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> have {{difficulty}} walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, {{they often have}} their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes {{have difficulty}} with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier <b>with</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> may tie more quickly.|$|E

40|$|Toe-in gait and crouch gait {{can make}} {{children}} <b>with</b> mild <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> fall and suffer improper balance during walking or ambulation training. A customized external strap orthosis for correcting leg alignment {{was used to}} resolve this problem. The {{purpose of this study}} was to research the immediate effects while wearing the customized external strap orthosis. Pressure platform was used to assess the plantar pressure through static and dynamic assessments and to record the changes in path of pressure trajectory. Motion image analysis system was used to record the gait parameters, which included gait speed, stride length, and cadence. The influence of both wearing and removing the orthosis on the dominant leg of children <b>with</b> mild <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> was analyzed. Nine children <b>with</b> mild <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> who all had a dominant right leg, were recruited. After wearing the orthosis, all gait parameters improved, and foot motion changed in the stance phase of the gait cycle. The path of pressure trajectory closing to the midline was also observed during dynamic assessment. Changes in plantar pressure and path of pressure trajectory were observed and the orthosis device could provide immediate assistance to correct the leg alignment and improve the gait performance in children <b>with</b> mild <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy...</b>|$|R
