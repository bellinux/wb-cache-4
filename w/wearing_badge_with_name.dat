50|$|Like {{most cities}} in Judge Dredd, Hondo is run under a Judge system, with the Judge-Inspectors acting as government, police and judge, jury and executioner to {{preserve}} order. The Hondo Judge-Inspectors are highly disciplined and well-armed, and {{are similar in}} mindset and culture to ancient samurai. Their uniforms have bio-circuitry links allowing them to use their tendo stave weapons (a form of bludgeon and also a hidden built in laser rifle.) and laser-shuriken discs as extensions of their own bodies. In following their samurai leanings, energy-based sabers, futuristic nunchucks and traditional katanas are also used. Unlike foreign Judges, they <b>wear</b> no <b>badge</b> <b>with</b> their <b>name</b> on; their names are printed on the rising sun symbol on their uniforms, viewable only through the visor on another Judge's helmet, with the intent that the citizens see justice as one entity rather than a group of individuals. Originally they piloted high-speed Japanese versions of Mega-City One's Lawmaster cycles, but they have recently upgraded to hovercycles.|$|R
