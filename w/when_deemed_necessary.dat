2500|$|Quotas are {{normally}} reviewed {{every five years}} and can be increased <b>when</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> by the Board of Governors. IMF voting shares are relatively inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-represented as their voting power lags behind. Currently, reforming the representation of developing countries within the IMF has been suggested. These countries' economies represent {{a large portion of}} the global economic system but this is not reflected in the IMF's decision making process through the nature of the quota system. Joseph Stiglitz argues, [...] "There is a need to provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries, which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since 1944, when the IMF was created." [...] In 2008, a number of quota reforms were passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.|$|E

2500|$|In the Imperial Parliament {{there were}} [...] "solid and {{competitive}} parties, an active parliament, a free press, open debate", traditions that the Old Republic did not maintain. Both the emperor and the ministers of state always sought {{to act with}} attention to Parliament, making a sincere effort to improve the country's political system by adopting characteristics inherent in Parliamentarianism. For example: {{the definition of the}} cabinet's governmental program was drafted by the President of the Council of Ministers, and was, in turn, presented by the monarch every year {{at the opening of the}} Chamber of Deputies. Another example was the emergence of the possibility that Parliament, <b>when</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary,</b> would submit a motion of no confidence against the cabinet of ministers. This provided a mode of defense (used at exceptional moments) of the parliamentary minority against the cabinet formed by the majority, were they to act inappropriately.|$|E
