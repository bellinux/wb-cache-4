5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it <b>was</b> <b>here</b> in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E

5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who {{had never}} been {{particularly}} popular among his followers—tried {{to convince them that}} she should be their new leader.

Possibly aged about sixty-five at this point in his life, it <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that Echmarcach died, in either 1064 or 1065. In the decades following his demise, the Uí Briain used Echmarcach's descendants as a means to dominate and control Dublin and the Isles. One of his grandsons eventually ruled as king.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being a hazard to navigation, the Torran Rocks south of Erraid are one of the locations featured in the novel Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. It <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour were ship-wrecked.|$|E

5|$|Stuart {{ended his}} 18-year stay in Britain and Ireland in 1793, leaving behind {{numerous}} unfinished paintings. He {{returned to the}} United States and settled briefly in New York City.

It <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that he gained {{a foothold in the}} art world and lasting fame with pictures of many important Americans of the day.|$|E
5|$|Though {{cetaceans}} {{have been}} held in captivity in both North America and Europe since the 1860s, the first being a pair of Beluga Whales in the New York City museum, dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in 1938 in St. Augustine, Florida. It <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that {{it was discovered that}} dolphins could be trained to perform tricks. Recognizing the success of Marine Studios, more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment.|$|E

5|$|When Hanna {{was three}} years old, {{the family moved to}} Baker City, Oregon, where his father worked on the Balm Creek Dam. It <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that Hanna {{developed}} his love of the outdoors. The family moved to Logan, Utah, before moving to San Pedro, California, in 1917. During the next two years they moved several times before eventually settling in Watts, California, in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a quarter}} of their funding went on {{repairing}} damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted {{a report to the}} NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the project for the development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of Popular Mechanics, in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory <b>was</b> <b>here</b> somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Born in Clayton, New Mexico, to {{a working-class}} family, Anderson was left {{visually}} impaired during childhood. His family regularly moved around within the United States during his early years, with Anderson claiming that encounters with Mexican, Hawaiian, and Haitian migrants led to him gaining an early {{understanding of these}} various cultures' magical practices. The family eventually settled in Oregon, and Anderson later claimed that it <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that he was initiated into a tradition of witchcraft by an African woman. He later claimed that, in 1932, he joined a magico-religious group known as the Harpy Coven which was based in Ashland and which dissolved in the 1940s. According to his description, the group was devoted to a god and goddess, Setan and Lilith, and were influenced by both American folk magic and Huna.|$|E
5|$|Born in Leuven, Belgium, Mertens {{started his}} career as a boy at the now-dissolved local club Stade Leuven. It <b>was</b> <b>here</b> that the scouts of Anderlecht first spotted Mertens, {{ultimately}} resulting in him being offered a chance to join the club's youth academy in 1998. He spent five years in the youth setup at Anderlecht before being released in 2003, with coaches finding him to be too be too short and physically incapable of competing at a professional level. Following his release from Anderlecht, Mertens was signed by fellow Belgian Pro League side, Gent. Following two seasons in Gent's youth academy, Mertens was loaned to Eendracht Aalst for the 2005–06 season. He excelled with the third division side and was named Player of the Year. The coaching staff at Gent, much like those at Anderlecht before, remained unconvinced of Mertens given his slight frame, however, and loaned him out again the following season, this time to AGOVV Apeldoorn in the Netherlands.|$|E
