40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to sort out firm-related {{differences}} from effects that result from different economic structures. A non-parametric decomposition is used to analyse firm level difference between the <b>wage</b> <b>spread</b> in the two major regions of unified Germany. If firm-specific effects explain wage dispersion between firms, a decomposition of the wage dispersion between firms is necessary. The decomposition can help to find out, whether the economy-wide results for different regions are due to the composition of the regional economies by industries and firm-size, or whether the differences are due to firm-specific influences, like distinctions in market power. For Germany, a considerable part of the difference in the <b>wage</b> <b>spread</b> between the East and the West can be explained by different economic structures. However, by far the greater part of the difference in the <b>wage</b> <b>spread</b> between firms in the two parts of the country results from lower wages paid by firms of the same type in East Germany compared with their counterparts in West Germany.

Only part of the difference can be explained by different economic structures in Eastern Germany. By far, the greater part of the difference in the <b>wage</b> <b>spread</b> between firms in the two parts of the country {{is due to the fact}} that differences in wages paid by firms of the same type in Eastern Germany are much less than those of their counterparts in Western Germany.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{international}} trade flows {{especially of the}} industrialized countries allegedly {{became more and more}} intra-industry. At the same time, employment perspectives particularly of the low-skilled by tendency deteriorated in these countries. This phenomenon is often traced back to the fact that intra-industry trade, which should theoretically involve low labor market adjustment, became increasingly vertical in nature and might thus entail labor market disruptions. Against this background, the present paper investigates the relationship between international trade patterns and selected labor market indicators in European countries, with a focus on vertical intra-industry trade. As the results show, neither inter- nor vertical intra-industry trade do have a verifiable effect on <b>wage</b> <b>spread</b> in EU member states. As far as structural unemployment is concerned, the latter increases only with the degree of countries’ specialization on capi-tal intensively manufactured products in inter-industry trade relations. Only for unemployment of the less-skilled, a slightly significant impact of superior vertical intra-industry trade seems to exist. However, the link between unemployment of the lower qualified and inter-industry specialization on labor intensive goods as well as parts and components imports is considerably higher. intra-industry trade, trade and labor market interactions, unemployment...|$|E

40|$|When {{employers}} observe imperfect {{measures of}} worker effort, theorists typically assume that observed effort is unimodal and symmetrically distributed. Though observable effort may be distributed {{in different ways}} within a work day, for example, available field data on these effort distributions are rare. The symmetry assumption is largely untestable as a result. This paper presents empirical data from two experimental work environments that question the validity of such assumptions. For these piece-rate work environments the author finds that observed effort is significantly negatively-skew (i. e. modal>mean effort). The author's hypothesis is that on-the-job leisure causes this skewness in observed effort distributions. There are both theoretical and practical implications of this asymmetry.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{formation}} of wages in the New Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, in particular the question what the relative role of national and sectoral factors is. While the labor relations in these countries {{are still in the}} process of change, some pattern and national differences have emerged. The question is thus to what extent these differences in labor relations are reflected in wage formation. The literature on Western OECD economies is unanimous that coordination of wage bargaining does reduce the <b>wage</b> <b>spread,</b> but disagrees on its effects on unemployment and inflation. The paper analyses wage formation in Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania by means of a panel analysis for manufacturing sectors. The average wage (in the total economy) serves as a national factor and sectoral productivity serves as a sectoral factor. In variations of the basic estimation equation the role of FDI and openness and of capital intensity and skill are also discussed. The results between countries are compared with the recent index of the coordination of collective bargaining by Visser (2005) and with cross country data on union density.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the boom in education on the wage structure in Europe. We use detailed information on the distribution of wages, estimated from microdata from 12 European countries {{from the beginning of the}} 1980 's to the present, to analyse the changes both between and within groups. We specify and estimate a model with supply and demand for different types of labour, as well as institutions affecting the bargained relative wage. Our results show that the boom in education closely matched the shifts in demand due to (skill biased) technological change, which in turn explains why the wage premia for education only rose moderately. We use the conditional <b>wage</b> <b>spread</b> within tertiary education, predicted from quantile log wage regressions, to investigate the hypothesis of skills erosion as a result of the large expansion in tertiary education. We find no evidence in favour of the hypothesis that the boom in higher education lead to an erosion of skills within the group of tertiary education, nor evidence of increasing over-education in Europe. Labour market institutions also matter: bargaining co-ordination and employment protection are shown to have a compressing effect on wages, but at different points of the wage distribution...|$|E
40|$|In recent {{literature}} skill-biased technical {{change has}} been viewed as a ma-jor cause for wage inequality. Some modelling and presentation of stylized facts have been undertaken for U. S. time series data. A preliminary study of wage inequality in a model with knowledge as input in an aggregate pro-duction function has been presented by Murphy, Riddell and Romer (1998). Although some important forces determining wage inequality are widely ac-cepted we know little about the quantitative impact of each source and dif-ferences across countries. We present a growth model of the Romer type with innovation based technical change and two skill groups where the growth of knowledge, the relative supply of the two skill groups, externalities and substi-tution effects among the two groups are the driving forces for wage inequality. We undertake estimates for U. S. time series data and contrast those estimates with results from some European countries. In particular, we compare param-eter estimations for U. S. and German time series data. The paper concludes that there is less wage inequality across skills in Europe {{in contrast to the}} U. S. on the macroeconomic level. But, considering disaggregated data we observe some increase in inequality for Germany, too.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of years from 1995 to 2008 was {{acquired}} by Average Earnings Information System under the professional gestation of the Czech Republic Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs wage and personal data by individual employees. Thanks {{to the fact that}} in this statistical survey are collected wage and personal data by concrete employed persons it is possible to obtain a wage distribution, so it how this <b>wages</b> <b>spread</b> out among individual employees. Values that wages can be assumed in whole wage interval are not deterministical but they result from interactions of many random influences. The wage is necessary due to this randomness considered as random quantity with its probability density function. This <b>spreading</b> of <b>wages</b> in all labor market segments is described a wage distribution. Even though a representation of a high-income employee category is evidently small, one's incomes markedly affect statistically itemized average wage level and particularly the whole wage file variability. So wage employee collections are distinguished by the averaged wage that exceeds wages of a major employee mass and the high variability due to great wage heterogeneity. A general approach to distribution of earning modeling under current heterogeneity conditions don't permit to fit by some chosen distribution function or probably density function. This leads to the idea to apply some quantile approach with statistical modeling, i. e. to model an earning distribution with some appropriate inverse distributional function. The probability modeling by generalized or compound forms of quantile functions enables better to characterize a wage distribution, which distinguishes by high asymmetry and wage heterogeneity. The application of inverse distributional function as a probability model of a wage distribution can be expressed in forms of distributional mixture of partial employee's groups. All of the component distributions of this mixture model correspond to an employee's group with greater homogeneity of earnings. The partial employee's subfiles differ in parameters of their component density and in shares of this density in the total wage distribution of the wage file...|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{study of}} the Dow Jones Stoxx Football index exhibits a high volatility of the returns and share prices regarding a sample of floated clubs {{as well as an}} insufficient market depth (low and irregular traded volumes). The theoretical analysis of the relationship between market illiquidity and share price volatitlity does not rely on an insufficient funding by speculators who adopt “contrarian” behaviour but on the uncertainty attached to the fundamental value of football clubs. The outcome is multiple equilibria in the market for assets. From witnessing how brokers and specialised audits value three representative football clubs, it appears that it is extremely difficult to fix the actual fundamental value of a football business. The sporting performances of a club have a strong incidence on its share price all over the season (tested with English football clubs). Such result opens an avenue for further research about the fundamental value of a football club. Instead of considering – as in the Anglo-American view – that the stock market will discipline the governance and management of European football clubs, we show that it would be worth hardening the clubs’ budget constraint before their exposure to financial market evaluation. The financial crisis of European football is less harsh in France though it translates into big clubs accounting imbalances, a high volatitlity of their return on equity, and their lasting indebtedness. It is so despite the existing financial supervisory body which monitors French football (the so-called DNCG), contrarily to the situation in other European football leagues. A “weak” clubs’ governance is revealed by their reluctant account disclosure (eventually achieved) and their inability to curb wage inflation and handle player transfers. We test that the club budget constraint is softened by the television godsend which is a significant determinant of player <b>wages.</b> <b>Spreading</b> the “French model” of governance throughout European football still requires some progress, which is also a prerequisite for successful float of football club shares at the stock exchange.

40|$|Emerging {{countries}} {{in many cases}} are more crisis-prone than highly developed industrialized countries. This is in many cases due to a weak or volatile financial sector. The best policy to strengthen crisis resistance is the building up of a sound financial position. A sound financial position of a country also increases the capacities {{to get out of}} a crisis. For getting out of a crisis, however, an important additional general condition must be fulfilled: the economy must increase its international competitiveness to assure growth, the only way out of a crisis. Building up a sound financial position and a competitive private sector, therefore, should be a pre-crisis policy. It relates to the public sector as well as the financial institutions. Once a crisis has erupted in an unsound financial environment there is no chance to escape a crisis sustainably avoiding a painful process. The blueprint for getting out of a crisis suggests a complex policy approach. The private financial sector must undergo structural reforms (in reality closing down or downscaling unsound institutions) and the government must apply fiscal austerity measures to reduce public debt, regaining credibility and by this creating new fiscal options for counteracting crisis effects. Labour costs can be reduced by increasing the labour market flexibility (e. g. by easier hiring and firing and higher <b>wage</b> <b>spreads</b> especially towards the lower wage scale) and by measures directly reducing labour costs. The result of such measures will be an increase of unemployment and of felt unemployment risks by large population groups as well as general real income losses from labour. The fiscal austerity measures in addition and in short term will reduce economic activities and thus aggravate the social problems. These negative social effects of getting out of a crisis are the most crucial and controversial policy issue.

If attitudes changed from the average level to the most positive level, the wage earned by a well educated immigrant from a non developed country would increase by 12 %. This change in attitudes would increase the welfare of immigrants from Africa and Asia, through their wage and local amenities, by an equivalent to one third of their wage and the welfare of immigrants from South America and Eastern Europe by one fourth of their wage if they are well educated, and one tenth otherwise. In "Who is hurt by discrimination?", the effects of discrimination of immigrants on the labour market are studied in a search and wage-bargaining setting, including a risk of losing skills during the experience of unemployment. The negative effects of discrimination {{in the form of}} higher unemployment and lower <b>wages</b> <b>spread</b> to all workers, immigrants and natives, in all sectors of the economy. An increase in the share of immigrants in the economy exacerbates the problem of discrimination. In "Complementary controls of corruption", a theoretical model shows that when the judiciary and the media are more dependent and the elections less competitive, corruption flourishes. The three institutions are shown to be complementary. The empirical analysis indicates that the dependence of the judiciary and the media has a positive effect on perceived corruption and that the media is complementary with both the judiciary and the electoral system.

40|$|Proponents of {{financial}} liberalization argue that deregulation motivates bankers {{to increase their}} effort and operate {{at a higher level}} of efficiency and productivity. Sceptics, however, see that liberalization engenders economic instability and banking crises, and impedes growth. Bank efficiency and productivity, following liberalization, is extensively examined. Nonetheless, the core issue of bankers’ self-motivation remains implicitly assumed and unaddressed. Does liberalization self-motivate bankers and increase their efforts and productivity? This paper models bank productivity from this perspective and evaluates what proportion of banks’ total factor productivity is accounted for by the self-motivated productivity of bankers. We provide a micro-founded framework for the analyses of bankers’ optimal level of effort and effort-driven productivity. Our model also captures banks’ unit input-output prices, optimal <b>wages,</b> bank <b>spread</b> and the overall cost of bank services – measures that are important in evaluating reform policies. We assess the financial liberalization of Nepal as a test case and find that (i) bankers’ efforts and productivity have notably improved in Nepal, although banking services have become costly, and (ii) bank spread has moderately declined in recent years. Our approach is parametric which differs from DEA, hence complements the literature. We hope this analytical framework will be useful to evaluate reform episodes elsewhere...|$|R

Given the paucity of observations used in the original research, and given that we now have many more years of observation on the effects of living wages in the cities that passed them earlier, and new living wage laws in numerous cities, it is an opportune time to update the evidence on the effects of living wage laws, and that is the goal of this paper.|$|R
