The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E

(As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences.

500|$|Following the {{confrontation}} that concluded {{in the death}} of its former leader, the command of the Boricua Popular Army was inherited by an anonymous figure known as [...] "Comandante Guasábara", named after the Taíno word for [...] "war". Under his leadership, the group appears to have shifted its focus towards intelligence. For example, the group has not recorded a single military action. Instead, Guasábara has generally used the media to publish classified information. Under Guasábara, the Macheteros took an emphasis on publishing pieces regarding the use of Culebra and Vieques as bombing targets for the U.S. Navy; <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> a disproportionate number of military bases on the island (compared to states in the Union); the proportion of deaths within the ranks of the Independence and Nationalist leadership, including the alleged experimentation with radiation on Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos while he was incarcerated; the secret testing of Agent Orange on Puerto Rican soil; and cancer [...] "experiments" [...] administered by Cornelius P.

500|$|On August 30, 2000, the EPB sent {{a letter}} to the United States Congress citing {{previous}} attempt at communication and questioning if a lack of response was motivated by the legislators being more willing to satisfy traditional politicians in exchange for benefits. The organization then accused the territorial politics of the United States of perpetuating a crime against humanity by letting Puerto Rico carry with the negative consequences of the status quo. The Macheteros denied that they were motivated by hatred or a spirit of revenge, claiming that such a portrayal in the media and other outlets was an attempt to manipulate the public and international community (Latin America in particular) led by the FBI and the Navy, who publicly referred to the organization as [...] "terrorists", self-describing themselves as lovers of peace that acted against a lack of justice and equality. The EPB also cited its beliefs that the current generation of American politicians had moved away from the founding fathers and adopted expansionist politics. The organization called the Vieques protests a response to the political divisions promoted by these politics and cited it as an opportunity for Congress to change them. Citing that despite being a pacific people, Puerto Ricans are known to fight for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> fair, the EPB warned that their actions would continue and this was not meant as a threat, but rather a response. The Macheteros then argued that invading and annexing Puerto Rico as part of the Spanish–American War constituted a violation of international law since the autonomy granted in 1897 placed it en route to become a separate entity. The EPB also expressed that the influence of the United States prevent the actions of other UN members. The organization then recapitulated several events, including the campaigns of Albizu, the Blair house incident and the Congress shooting, and their own actions, discussing them as responses to the perpetuation of the status quo. Additionally, the group condemned the militarization of the archipelago and the unsanctioned medical experimentation with the population. The examples given included the devaluation of the Puerto Rican dollar, the imposition of the Jones Act, the illegal experiments with cancer cells by Cornelius Rhodes, the addition of pesticides to the water supply in an attempt to kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the testing of anticonceptive drugs on the unsuspecting public by Enovid, military tests with Agent Orange, a number of massacres in confrontations between the public and Congress appointed governors, the acquisition of Vieques and Culebra by the Navy, intelligence efforts to monitor and arrest independence supporters and the general public, a covert cocaine plantation with the intention of testing different methods to exterminate the plant and a program that intended to examine the effects of radiation on the local flora and fauna by the Atomic Energy Commission. Concluding with a call to pursue justice or face the consequences.|$|E
