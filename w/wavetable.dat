5000|$|The PPG Wave can be {{connected}} to multiple peripheral PPG components simultaneously, such as a [...] "smart" [...] keyboard controller (PRK), 8-voice expansion units (EVU), and a wave computer called Waveterm for sampling, editing, sequencing and creating user defined <b>wavetables.</b> Collectively, this setup {{is referred to as}} the [...] "PPG Wave System", which was intended to compete with the Fairlight CMI.|$|R
2500|$|Sample-based {{synthesis}} involves digitally {{recording a}} short snippet of sound {{from a real}} instrument or other source and then playing it back [...] at different speeds to produce different pitches. A sample can be played as a one shot, used often for percussion or short duration sounds, {{or it can be}} looped, which allows the tone to sustain or repeat as long as the note is held. Samplers usually include a filter, envelope generators, and other controls for further manipulation of the sound. Virtual samplers that store the samples on a hard drive make it possible for the sounds of an entire orchestra, including multiple articulations of each instrument, to be accessed from a sample library..

2500|$|In August, Sigsworth {{said in an}} {{interview}} with arbiter.co.uk that 25 songs were written for the album, 13 had been recorded, and eight more were being recorded after Morissette requested B-sides and [...] "exclusives". Sigsworth described Morissette as [...] "a dream to work with" [...] and [...] "totally into my sound world." [...] In the same interview, guitarist and programmer Andy Page said that at one point, they were working on 12 of the tracks simultaneously, and that one contains [...] "moshing, distorted guitars" [...] and a [...] "wall-of-noise" [...] created using Guitar Rig. Page also said that he had used the graphical modular software music studio Reaktor on the album, saying of it that [...] "I prefer using its granulators and weirder signal processors to its synths. Some of its physically modeled stuff is very cool, and there are some cool <b>wavetable</b> synths." [...] An October 2007 interview with Morissette, published on the blog Holons 2.0, reported that the title of the album was Flavors of Entanglement, while noting that no release date had been set.

50|$|The primary {{oscillator}} circuits of a synthesizer {{are used}} to create the audio signals. A LFO is a secondary oscillator that operates at a significantly lower frequency (hence its name), typically below 20 Hz. This lower frequency or control signal is used to modulate another component's value, changing the sound without introducing another source. Like a standard oscillator, this usually {{takes the form of}} a periodic waveform, such as a sine, sawtooth, triangle or square wave. Also like a standard oscillator, LFOs can incorporate any number of waveform types, including user-defined <b>wavetables,</b> rectified waves and random signals.|$|R

5000|$|Then, in 1980, Wolfgang Palm {{introduced}} a new concept, dubbed [...] "wavetable synthesis". These digital synthesizers expanded upon the capabilities of Palm's earlier synthesizers by expanding the sound creation tools with limited samples, which were compiled together in lists called <b>wavetables.</b> The first PPG synthesizer to implement this algorithm was the Wavecomputer 360, released in 1980 in two versions - the 360A, with 4 oscillators, and the 360B, with 8. However, the synthesizer sounded relatively thin, a consequence of having only one oscillator per voice and the typical limited polyphony of most synthesizers of its era.|$|R
50|$|After {{the decline}} of PPG, Wolfgang Palm {{continued}} to be an active innovator {{in the area of}} synthesizer technology. For Waldorf Music he designed the digital ASIC for the first Waldorf product Microwave (1989) which basically contained the complete sound engine of the PPG wave 2.2.Used by many professional artists (including Ace of Base and Depeche Mode), the Waldorf WAVE continues to be popular. The later Waldorf products like the MicroWave II, XT, Q, microQ, Blofeld all had all or several of the original <b>wavetables</b> and waveshapes of the PPG waves. In 2002, Steinberg released PLEX, a software synthesizer designed by Palm that wasn't sold by big numbers.|$|R
50|$|Wave Sequences {{were first}} {{introduced}} on Korg's Wavestation synthesizer, released in 1990. Wave Sequences allow a single note to play through {{a list of}} samples, one after the other, with or without crossfades, with other associated parameters changing for each sample, as listed below. This can create smooth, evolving timbres, or rhythmic effects. Internally, Wave Sequences are implemented by using two voices; voice A plays the first sample, voice B plays the second sample, voice A plays the third sample, and so on. Other synthesizers have featured concepts which are similar in some aspects, such as PPG, Waldorf, and Access Virus <b>wavetables,</b> Synclavier resynthesis, and Ensoniq Transwaves and Hyperwaves (see the Ensoniq TS 10).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an analysis, modeling, and {{synthesis}} approach to bell sounds. Recorded bell sounds are first analyzed by high-resolution frequency-zooming modal estimation technique, where each partial is described typically by 2 - 3 submodes {{in order to}} include the warble characteristics of envelope beating in the partials. The bells are then modeled by inharmonic digital waveguides (DWGs) {{in order to achieve}} a highly efficient yet parametrically controllable synthesis model. The third step is to make a set of bells and related parametric controls in order to build a “computer carillon”. Special means are needed to approximate the strongly inharmonic bell sounds by DWGs, paying particular attention to the accuracy of the lowest partials. The control of bell models in the computerized carillon is through triggering of <b>wavetables</b> that store the initial part of the residual signal obtained in the modal decomposition process. Changing or modulating the modal parameters allows for sound effects that are not possible in real physical bells. 1...|$|R
