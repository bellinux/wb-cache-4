5|$|She was {{not fully}} {{repaired}} {{and returned to}} service until 1807, when she <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean. In 1809 she participated in the successful invasion of Martinique, and the subsequent battle with Troude's squadron. Returning to Britain {{towards the end of}} the wars, she was laid up in ordinary, and in 1813 became a temporary prison ship. She was finally broken up in 1818.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 {{was off the}} Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|Concorde {{was one of}} a three-ship {{class of}} Concorde-class frigates built for the French Navy to a design by Henri Chevillard. She was built at Rochefort between April 1777 and January 1778, being {{launched}} on 3 September 1777. She <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Indies after the French entry to the American War of Independence, and reached Martinique on 17 August 1778. On 28 August 1778 she came up on the 32-gun , under Captain John Stott, and after {{two and a half hours}} of fighting, captured her. Minerva was towed to Cap Français on Saint-Domingue, where she was joined shortly afterwards by the captured , which a hurricane had dismasted in late August and which the French frigates Charmante and Dédaigneuse had captured on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Linzee was {{advanced}} to rear-admiral on 11 April 1794 and shifted his flag to the 98-gun , bringing Downman {{with him as}} his second lieutenant. He was then moved into the 100-gun , the flagship of Admiral Lord Hood, and returned with Hood to England. Hood was preparing {{to return to the}} Mediterranean aboard Victory, when on 2 May he was ordered to strike his flag. Victory then <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean as a private ship, whereupon she became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Mann, and then Sir John Jervis. Under Mann Downman saw action at the Naval Battle of Hyères Islands on 13 July 1795, and under Jervis he was at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797.|$|E

5|$|Built at Frindsbury, near Rochester in Kent, Bellerophon was {{initially}} laid up in ordinary, briefly being commissioned during the Spanish and Russian Armaments. She entered service with the Channel Fleet on {{the outbreak of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, and took part in the Glorious First of June in 1794, the first of several fleet actions of the wars. Bellerophon narrowly escaped being captured by the French in 1795, when her squadron was nearly overrun by a powerful French fleet, but the bold actions of the squadron's commander, Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, caused the French to retreat. She played a minor role in efforts to intercept a French invasion force bound for Ireland in 1797, and then joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Sir John Jervis. Detached to reinforce Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson's fleet in 1798, she took part in the decisive defeat of a French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. She then returned to England and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Indies, where she spent the Peace of Amiens on cruises and convoy escort duty between the Caribbean and North America.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's group {{opponents in}} Italia '90 were England, Egypt and the Netherlands. Charlton felt that England's four-man midfield of Waddle, Barnes, Bryan Robson and Paul Gascoigne {{did not offer}} enough {{protection}} to the back four, and he was proved correct when Kevin Sheedy cancelled out Gary Lineker's opener to secure a 1–1 draw in the group opener at the Stadio Sant'Elia. A poor performance against a negative Egyptian side at the Stadio La Favorita meant that neither side scored a goal in a dour draw. They ended the group with a 1–1 draw with the Dutch, Niall Quinn cancelling out Ruud Gullit's opener in the 71st minute, after which both sides settled for a stalemate as a draw meant that both qualified ahead of Egypt. Ireland then defeated Romania in the Second Round match at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris which went to penalties after a 0–0 draw, before the whole team had a meeting Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Ireland eventually <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hosts, Italy, 1–0 in the quarter-finals at the Stadio Olimpico. A lapse of concentration meant that Italy's Salvatore Schillaci scored on 38 minutes, and Ireland failed to build up enough chances to find the equalising goal. After returning to Dublin over 500,000 people turned out to welcome the team back.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented {{followers}} seized Bligh and {{took control of}} the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other actually <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pandora in canoes , very happy to be rescued-as they thought. They were then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E

5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mound {{to take out the}} angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E

25|$|HMS Procris was a Cruizer-class brig-sloop {{launched}} in 1807. She {{served at the}} second battle of Copenhagen.

He was court-martialed for this, but though several charges were proved, he was judged to have acted in the service's best interests, and was acquitted. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean late in the Napoleonic Wars, and commanded the inshore squadron during the blockade of Toulon. He led one of the last attacks on the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Action of 5 November 1813, and retired ashore {{after the end of the}} wars. He developed a new technique for hoisting staysails, received further promotions, and a knighthood, while in retirement, before his death in 1851 at the rank of admiral.|$|E
