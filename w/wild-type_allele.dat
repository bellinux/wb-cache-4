5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The <b>wild-type</b> <b>allele</b> {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
25|$|Dominant {{negative}} mutations (also called antimorphic mutations) have {{an altered}} gene product that acts antagonistically to the <b>wild-type</b> <b>allele.</b> These mutations usually {{result in an}} altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterized by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype. In humans, dominant negative mutations have been implicated in cancer (e.g., mutations in genes p53, ATM, CEBPA and PPARgamma). Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, located on chromosome 15, which encodes fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix. Marfan syndrome is also an example of dominant negative mutation and haploinsufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous {{carriers}} (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal {{enzyme activity}} but manifest no disease symptoms. This phenomenon is called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles' dominance over nonfunctional mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used {{up in the}} process, so only small enzyme quantities are required {{to carry out a}} reaction. Someone homozygous for a nonfunctional mutation in the enzyme-encoding gene has little or no enzyme activity, so will manifest the abnormal phenotype. A heterozygote (heterozygous individual) has {{at least half of the}} normal enzyme activity level, due to expression of the <b>wild-type</b> <b>allele.</b> This level is normally enough to enable normal function and thus prevent phenotypic expression.|$|E
40|$|Background. Usefulness of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as {{first-line}} {{therapy for}} uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy throughout sub-Saharan Africa is com-promised by {{the spread of}} dhfr alleles associated with pyrimethamine resistance. A predominant haplotype associated with the N 51 I+C 59 R+S 108 N triple-mutant dhfr allele has been reported recently in 4 African countries. A more comprehensive picture {{of the evolution of}} this mutant allele in Africa is lacking. Methods. Seventy-five P. falciparum isolates carrying the <b>wild-type</b> dhfr <b>allele</b> and 204 carrying the triple-mutant dhfr allele from 11 African countries were selected. The genetic diversity of the chromosomes bearing these alleles was analyzed with 4 microsatellite markers closely linked to the dhfr gene. Results. Seventy-three different 4 -locus haplotypes carrying the <b>wild-type</b> dhfr <b>allele</b> were found. By contrast, 175 (85 %) of 204 isolates carrying the triple-mutant dhfr allele shared a unique haplotype, identical to the one identified in Thailand.

40|$|Virulent Salmonella typhimurium strains {{differ from}} the {{attenuated}} laboratory strain LT 2 at the rpoS locus. It was previously shown that the rpoS gene in strain LT 2 contains a rare UUG start codon (I. S. Lee, J. Lin, H. K. Hall, B. Bearson, and J. W. Foster, Mol. Microbiol. 17 : 155 - 167, 1995). This difference {{is responsible for the}} inability of LT 2 to display a sustained log-phase acid tolerance response. We show that the altered rpoS allele (rpoS(LT 2)) also affects the stationary-phase acid tolerance response in Salmonella. By transducing the rpoS(LT 2) allele into virulent strain backgrounds and crossing <b>wild-type</b> rpoS <b>allele</b> into strain LT 2, we demonstrate that the rpoS(LT 2) allele contributes to the attenuation of strain LT 2. We examined the effect of the rpoS allele on invasion and found that the rpoS status of the cell had no effect on the ability of the strains to invade intestinal epithelial cells in tissue culture. Enumeration of bacteria from tissues of infected mice indicated that the presence of the rpoS(LT 2) allele affected the ability of S. typhimurium to reach the liver and spleen and to persist in several tissues at 6 days postinfection. This is likely due, at least in part, to a decrease in spv gene expression in these mutants. We demonstrate that strains containing the rpoS(LT 2) allele are not only sensitive to pH 3. 0 (acid stress) but are also sensitive to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate. However, these strains appear to survive stationary-phase and oxidative stresses as well as strains containing a <b>wild-type</b> rpoS <b>allele.</b> Despite an increased sensitivity to acid stress and DNA damage, strains containing either an rpoS-null mutation or the rpoS(LT 2) allele survived in J 774 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages as well as did otherwise isogenic strains with a <b>wild-type</b> rpoS <b>allele...</b>|$|R

Progeny singly homozygous for the tfpidelta modification but with the <b>wild-type</b> fVII <b>allele</b> (FVII+/+/TFPIdelta/delta), and mice singly homozygous for the fVII deficiency and possessing the <b>wild-type</b> tfpi <b>allele</b> (FVII-/-/TFPI+/+), displayed previously detailed phenotypes (i. e., {{a high percentage of}} early embryonic lethality at E 9. 5 or normal development with severe perinatal bleeding, respectively). Surprisingly, mice of the combined FVII-/-/TFPIdelta/delta genotype were born at the expected mendelian frequency but suffered the fatal perinatal bleeding associated with the FVII-/- genotype. Mice carrying the FVII+/-/TFPIdelta/delta genotype were also rescued from the lethality associated with the FVII+/+/TFPIdelta/delta genotype but succumbed to perinatal consumptive coagulopathy. Thus, the rescue of TFPIdelta/delta embryos, either by an accompanying homozygous or heterozygous FVII deficiency, suggests that diminishment of FVII activity precludes the need for TFPI-mediated inhibition of the FVIIa/tissue factor coagulation pathway during embryogenesis. Furthermore, the phenotypes of these combined deficiency states suggest that embryonic FVII is produced in mice as early as E 9. 5 and that any level of maternal FVII in early-stage embryos is insufficient to cause a coagulopathy in TFPIdelta/delta mice. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|PTEN {{mutation}} and {{microsatellite instability}} {{are two of}} the most common genetic alterations in uterine endometrioid carcinoma. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested an association between the two alterations, however the basis and consequence of the association is not understood. Recently {{it has been shown that}} 100 % of female Pten+/− mice develop complex atypical hyperplasia by 32 weeks of age that progresses to endometrial carcinoma in ∼ 20 to 25 % of mice at 40 weeks. In an attempt to expand this mouse model of endometrial tumorigenesis and to further our understanding of the association betweenPten mutations and DNA mismatch repair deficiency, we generated Ptenheterozygous, Mlh 1 -null (mismatch repair deficient) mice. Significantly, the majority ofPten+/−/Mlh 1 −/−mice developed polypoid lesions in the endometrium at 6 to 9 weeks of age. By 14 to 18 weeks, all of the double-mutant mice had lesions histologically similar to those seen inPten+/− mice, and two of them exhibited invasive disease. Moreover, the frequency of loss of the <b>wild-type</b> Pten <b>allele</b> in the double-mutant mice at 14 to 18 weeks was similar to that seen in lesions from 40 -week-old Pten+/− mice. Taken together, our results indicate that DNA mismatch repair deficiency can accelerate endometrial tumorigenesis inPten heterozygous mice and suggests that loss of the <b>wild-type</b> Pten <b>allele</b> is involved in the development/progression of tumors in this setting...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila Prat gene encodes phosphoribosylamidotransferase (PRAT), {{the enzyme}} that {{performs}} the first committed {{step of the}} de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Using information from amino acid sequence alignments of PRAT from other organisms, a polymerase chain reaction-based approach was employed to clone Prat. Amino acid sequence alignment of Drosophila PRAT with PRAT from bacteria, yeast, and vertebrates indicates that it is most identical (at least 60 %) to the vertebrate PRATs. It shares putative amino-terminal propeptide and ironbinding domains seen only in Bacillus subtilis and vertebrate PRATs. Prat was localized to the right arm of chromosome 3 at polytene band 84 E 1 - 2. Owing {{to the fact that}} this region had been well characterized previously, Prat was localized to a 30 -kilobase region between two deficiency break-points. By making the prediction that Prat would have a similar ``purine syndrome'' phenotype as mutations in the genes ade 2 and ade 3, which encode enzymes downstream in the pathway, five alleles of Prat were isolated. Three of the alleles were identified as missense mutations. A comparison of PRAT enzyme activity with phenotype in three of the mutants indicates that a reduction to 40 % of the <b>wild-type</b> <b>allele's</b> activity is sufficient to cause the purine syndrome, suggesting that PRAT activity is limiting in Drosophila...|$|R

40|$|P 23 H is {{the most}} common {{mutation}} in the RHODOPSIN (RHO) gene leading to a dominant form of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a rod photoreceptor degeneration that invariably causes vision loss. Specific disruption of the disease P 23 H RHO mutant while preserving the <b>wild-type</b> functional <b>allele</b> would be an invaluable therapy for this disease. However, various technologies tested in the past failed to achieve effective changes and consequently therapeutic benefits. We validated a CRISPR/Cas 9 strategy to specifically inactivate the P 23 H RHO mutant, while preserving the <b>wild-type</b> (WT) <b>allele</b> in vitro. We, then, translated this approach in vivo by delivering the CRISPR/Cas 9 components in murine Rho+/P 23 H mutant retinae. Targeted retinae presented a high rate of cleavage in the P 23 H but not WT Rho allele. This gene manipulation was sufficient to slow photoreceptor degeneration and improve retinal functions. In order improve the translational potential of our approach we tested intravitreal delivery of this system by means of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To this purpose the employment of the AAV 9 -PHP. B resulted the most effective in disrupting the P 23 H Rho mutant. Finally, this approach was translated successfully in human cells engineered with the homozygous P 23 H RHO gene mutation. Overall, this is a significant proof-of-concept that gene allele specific targeting by CRISPR/Cas 9 technology is specific and efficient and represents an unprecedented tool for treating RP and more broadly dominant genetic human disorders affecting the eye, as well as other tissues...|$|R

40|$|Ethambutol {{resistance}} in clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates is associated primarily with missense mutations in the embB gene. However, recent reports {{have described the}} presence of embB mutations, especially those at embB codon 306, in isolates susceptible to ethambutol. To clarify the role of embB mutations in ethambutol resistance, we sequenced the ethambutol resistance-determining region in spontaneous ethambutol-resistant mutants. In our study, 66 % of spontaneous mutants contained a single point mutation in embB, with 55 % of these occurring at embB 306. The MIC of ethambutol for spontaneous mutants was increased two- to eightfold relative to the pansusceptible M. tuberculosis strains from which the mutants were generated. To further characterize the role of embB 306 mutations, we directly introduced mutant alleles, embB(M 306 V) or embB(M 306 I), into pansusceptible M. tuberculosis strains and conversely reverted mutant alleles in spontaneous ethambutol-resistant mutants back {{to those of the}} wild type via allelic exchange using specialized linkage transduction. We determined that the MIC of ethambutol was reduced fourfold for three of the four spontaneous ethambutol-resistant embB 306 mutants when the mutant allele was replaced with the <b>wild-type</b> embB <b>allele.</b> The MIC for one of the spontaneous mutants genetically reverted to wild-type embB was reduced by only twofold. When the <b>wild-type</b> embB <b>allele</b> was converted to the mutant allele embB(M 306 V), the ethambutol MIC was increased fourfold, and when the allele was changed to M 306 I, the ethambutol MIC increased twofold. Our data indicate that embB 306 mutations are sufficient to confer ethambutol resistance, and detection of these mutations should be considered in the development of rapid molecular tests...|$|R
