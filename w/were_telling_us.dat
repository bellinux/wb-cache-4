So that night I went to the studio and I was telling Chris about (the meeting). And he was like, 'Let's get on it.' It was crazy, because Jerry Bruckheimer's dream {{was to have a}} song from Rihanna (for the movie), and I delivered Rihanna and Chris Brown in 24 hours. So they were like, 'Wow, that's crazy. He continued to explain how he, Rihanna and Brown developed the song in the recording studio, saying [...] "When her, Chris and myself were in the room, it's fun. That's when the music isn't work at all. It's all freestyle. Chris comes up with an idea; I come up with one. Rihanna will weigh in. And we build." [...] The song leaked on January 6, 2009. Their version of the song was excluded from the soundtrack, in favor of a version performed by the American girl group The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E

Bands {{who were}} doing {{well at the}} time [...] - Celtic Frost, Helloween, Kreator - were all on Noise. We had {{complete}} artistic freedom, {{but not for the}} right reasons.

"If it {{had been}} any other morning, father, I might have thought more of Cyril's appearance; but what you <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> but now of the {{continuance}} of the Plague is so sad, that mourning, rather than Court attire, {{would seem to be}} the proper wear." ...|$|E

"We {{left our}} outfits back {{here on a}} little lake--maybe you saw our Indian guide--and struck out ahead {{to see if we}} could find those splendid prairies they <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> about, where the caribou and the moose were so thick you couldn't miss 'em. We've been forty miles up the trail. It's all a climb, and the very worst yet. You'll come finally to a high snowy divide with nothing but {{mountains}} on every side. There is no prairie; it's all a lie, and we're going back to Hazleton to go around by way of Skagway. Have you any idea where we are?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Tennyson's {{place is}} {{not among the}} [...] "lords of the visionary eye," [...] among seers, among prophets, but not the {{least part of the}} debt which his countrymen owe to him is his {{dedication}} of his art to the noblest purposes.

60|$|His {{attitude}} {{on this point}} struck me as strangely liberal in {{a man of his}} age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and sweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was good. He began to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew. There was nothing he liked, he said, so much as looking at a nice young girl, at her nice white hands and her beautiful soft hair. He gave me the impression that he was repeating something which he had learned by heart or that, magnetised by some words of his own speech, his mind was slowly circling round and round in the same orbit. At times he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew, and at times he lowered his voice and spoke mysteriously as if he <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> something secret which he did not wish others to overhear. He repeated his phrases over and over again, varying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice. I continued to gaze towards the foot of the slope, listening to him.|$|E

5000|$|Shilpa Ganatra, {{writing in}} the Irish Independent in 2008, said: [...] "Explaining Other Voices to a {{foreigner}} would sound like a flu-induced dream. I was in a pub in this tiny fishing village in the west of Ireland, where Ryan Adams was being filmed playing in front of 80 people in a tiny church. He was in the pub afterwards, and so was Paul Noonan from Bell X1 and Sinéad O'Connor, and Fight Like Apes <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> about the most sordid website in existence".|$|E
5000|$|Nocera's {{contention}} notwithstanding, {{at least}} one executive at Fannie Mae had an entirely different viewpoint, stating in an interview: Everybody understood that we were now buying loans {{that we would have}} previously rejected, and that the models <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> that we were charging way too little, but our mandate was to stay relevant and to serve low-income borrowers. So that's what we did." [...] Fannie and Freddie were both under political pressure to expand purchases of higher-risk affordable housing mortgage types, and under significant competitive pressure from large investment banks and mortgage lenders.|$|E
5000|$|Tensions {{within the}} band began to mount, {{most of them}} {{revolved}} around money. The band were developing a very good following and selling a lot of merchandise, however they were victims of poor management and with a label (Noise) that {{did not seem to}} care what the band did. Martin Walkyier:"With the Noise contract, people <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> 'Don't sign it,' but we did. Bands who were doing well at the time - Celtic Frost, Helloween, Kreator - were all on Noise. We had complete artistic freedom, but not for the right reasons.
