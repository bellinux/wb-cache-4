40|$|Knowledge of a {{population}} presenting to an Emergency Department should allow to improve its organisation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze variations of choosen parameters according days and hours of admission. Measurements were performed from a database recorded in DBASE III and transfered in Access Microsoft for time management facilitation. Increases of population during <b>week-ends</b> and nights were particularly investigated. The study shows some general observations like a maximum of visits on monday, a minimum on thursday followed by an increase on friday. ENT, ophtalmologic, stomatologic and dermatologic emergencies increased on <b>week-ends</b> as well as the number of children. At night, psychiatric, ophtalmologic, intoxications and stomatologic emergencies were increasing. Many children came after 7 h PM. These observations could have a practical impact on education of physicians and nurses working nightly or during the <b>week-ends.</b> © 1994 arnette S. A.

25|$|August {{began with}} a win over Championship leaders Durham at their {{secondary}} home ground in Southend, as Essex took third place in the table and closed the gap to 22 points. Middlesex visited Southend the following day, and Essex won a closely fought game by two runs to take an eight-point lead over second-placed Middlesex with two games in hand – with 16 points to number three and six games to play. The next <b>week-end,</b> they suffered a 60-run loss to Gloucestershire after they were bowled out for 122, but as Middlesex also lost to Northamptonshire the next <b>week-end,</b> Essex went closer to the title. A midweek Championship match saw the team go down to a 120-run first innings deficit against Derbyshire in Derby, but they still won the match, sending them into {{second place in the}} Division Two table. A no-result in the National League extended their lead to ten points with four games remaining, before they declared twice in a rain-hit match with Somerset and lost by five wickets. The next day – the last Sunday in August – they won the National League win over Hampshire Hawks to take their first major trophy since winning the Natwest Trophy in 1997.|$|E

These flights served popular resorts in the Alpine region and the Mediterranean.

25|$|Occasionally {{governments and}} {{linguistic}} institutions of both Quebec and France have undertaken strenuous efforts to eradicate Anglicisms, often by suggesting French replacements with French phonology and morphology.

Sociolinguists have attributed these failures to the general inability of linguistic institutions to enforce a linguistic norm. The Académie française regularly updates a list of prescribed linguistic norms, many of which include using suggested French replacements instead of anglicisms (ex: mot-dièse for hashtag).|$|E
