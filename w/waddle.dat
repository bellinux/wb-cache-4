5|$|Felling has a {{long history}} of {{producing}} professional footballers. Arguably the most notable of these is Chris <b>Waddle.</b> <b>Waddle,</b> born 14 December 1960 and a lifelong Sunderland supporter, was a professional footballer who played for Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and Marseille and who won 62 caps for England. Despite winning three league titles in France and playing in the 1991 European Cup Final, the skilful winger is probably most remembered for missing England's fifth penalty in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, {{they won}} the Northern League Cup, beating Ashington 2–1 in the final at Crook. In the summer of 1978, Chris <b>Waddle</b> started playing for the club. In the summer of 1980, while <b>Waddle</b> was working in a sausage factory, he was sold to Newcastle United for the fee of £1,000. Tow Law Town were runners-up in the 1988–89 season, before finally winning the league again in 1994–95, sitting 14 points clear {{at the end of}} the season. They missed out on the runners up spot the {{following}} year on goal difference. Harry Hodgson had long served as Chairman of the club, but stood down at the end of 1995–96, but as of 2011 he still remains a member of the committee. John Flynn took over as Chairman. At the end of 1996–97, Harry Dixon, another long standing official at the club, stood down as treasurer, but stayed on as the club's president. Kevin McCormick took over as treasurer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Waddles</b> was a duck {{drawn by}} George Hager for the Christian Science Monitor in the cartoon strip The Adventures of the <b>Waddles.</b> According to the Seattle Daily Times, <b>Waddles</b> was a {{continuation}} of the his father's duck, associated with the weather man. Dok had to discontinue his illustrating when his eyes went, and his children ran the <b>Waddles</b> comic strip. Dok's daughter, Mrs. George Dearborn wrote the rhyming lines to go with the cartoon, while son George Hager did the illustration.|$|R
50|$|Charleszetta <b>Waddles</b> (October 7, 1912 - July 12, 2001), {{also known}} as Mother <b>Waddles,</b> was an African-American activist, Pentecostal church minister, and founder of Mother <b>Waddles</b> Perpetual Mission, an {{independent}} church in Detroit that provides support, such as food, clothing and other basic services to Detroit's poor. She is listed in the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame for her contributions to Social Work and Mission Work in the Detroit area.|$|R

5|$|Morrow {{returned}} to Somerset in 1903. There, he married Katherine Hale <b>Waddle</b> on June 18, 1903. Waddle's father had studied law under Morrow's father, and Edwin and Katherine had been playmates, schoolmates, and later sweethearts. The couple had two children, Edwina Haskell in July 1904 and Charles Robert in November 1908.|$|E
5|$|Swan had {{no respect}} for Heath and was not afraid to show it, and so Heath kept Swan's {{appearances}} to a minimum in 1996–97. He offered loan moves to Third Division Hartlepool United and Hereford United, offers which Swan dismissed out of hand, and so Heath placed him on the transfer list. The transfer took until August 1997, at which point {{he moved on to}} Bury for a fee of £50,000 – this reunited him with manager Stan Ternent. The move had been delayed after Heath left Burnley to be replaced by Chris <b>Waddle,</b> though <b>Waddle</b> quickly sanctioned the transfer. Ternent moved Swan back to his role as a striker, despite the player having been used exclusively as a defender at his last few clubs. He scored six goals in his first twelve games before hitting a fifteen-game goal drought. He helped the club to narrowly avoid relegation {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|United dropped {{once again}} to the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1977–78 season. Dinnis was {{replaced}} by Bill McGarry, and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris <b>Waddle</b> and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as <b>Waddle,</b> Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in 1989. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by Jim Smith. Smith left at the start of the 1991–92 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement.|$|E
5000|$|For {{over four}} decades, the Reverend Charleszetta <b>Waddles,</b> affectionately known as [...] "Mother Waddles," [...] devoted {{her life to}} {{providing}} food, hope, and human dignity to the downtrodden and disadvantaged people of Detroit. Founder, director, and spiritual leader of the Mother <b>Waddles</b> Perpetual Mission, Inc., a nonprofit, nondenominational organization run by volunteers and dependent on private donations, <b>Waddles</b> believed that the church must move beyond religious dogma {{to focus on the}} real needs of real people.|$|R

5|$|On 4 July 1990, England played West Germany in a World Cup semi-final {{match at}} Juventus's Stadio delle Alpi in Turin. Gascoigne, having already {{received}} a yellow card during England's 1–0 victory over Belgium {{in the second}} round, was booked for a foul on Thomas Berthold, which meant {{that he would be}} suspended for the final if England won the match. Television cameras showed that he had tears in his eyes following the yellow card and made Gascoigne a highly popular figure with the sympathetic British public. The match culminated in a penalty shoot-out, which the Germans won after Stuart Pearce and Chris <b>Waddle</b> missed their penalties.|$|E
5|$|Willie McFaul {{took over}} as manager for the 1985–86 season, and named Gascoigne in his first eleven from the opening game of the campaign; he took the place of Chris <b>Waddle,</b> who had been sold to Tottenham Hotspur in the summer. He scored his first goal at home to Oxford United in a 3–0 victory on 21 September 1985, and claimed a further eight goals in the 1985–86 campaign. Newcastle {{finished}} 11th in the First Division that season and, {{at the end of}} it, Gascoigne was featured on the front cover of the Rothmans Football Yearbook.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{is married}} to Stephanie and they have two children, Grace and Andrew (born November 2007). His cousin, Scott Fletcher, also played for the Cubs, {{along with many other}} teams over his fifteen-year career. Barrett has spent a {{considerable}} portion of his personal life devoted to helping children. He runs several youth baseball programs, including one in Hawaii, which was inspired from his tenure with the Hawaiian Winter Baseball League. He also works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Cubs Care Program to help lesser fortunate and sick children. More recently, he has worked with Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster to raise money to help Derrek Lee's daughter and research for Leber's congenital amaurosis. Michael Barrett donated $50,000 to Project 3000 and pledged an additional sum of money for every home run he hits. Barrett was also a regular guest on FOX Chicago's The Final Word television show, which is co hosted by Tom <b>Waddle,</b> a former Chicago Bears wide receiver.|$|E

[...] In 1933, at age 21, she married LeRoy Wash, a 37-year-old truck driver, and the couple had six children together. The family moved together to Detroit in 1936. <b>Waddles</b> divorced Wash in 1945. She then lived in a common-law marriage with Roosevelt Sturkey and had three more children. In 1950 she married Payton <b>Waddles,</b> an employee of Ford Motor Company.|$|R
5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer. He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of skin cancer removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris <b>Waddle</b> as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|On board Deep Space Nine, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) {{is being}} queried by Department of Temporal Investigations agents Dulmer (Jack Blessing) and Lucsly (James W. Jansen). The Captain {{explains}} {{that he was on}} the USS Defiant, returning from Cardassian space with the Bajoran Orb of Time. They had picked up a hitchhiker on the way, a human called Barry <b>Waddle.</b> Suddenly the ship found itself some 200 light years away from its previous location and a hundred years in the past, near Deep Space Station K7 and found the USS Enterprise in orbit. They discover that the hitch-hiker was Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), a Klingon agent who had previously been caught by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) on K7 whilst trying to poison a shipment of grain.|$|E
5|$|Felling {{today is}} broadly {{residential}} save some light industry {{located at the}} bank of the River Tyne in north Felling. It is governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party. The vast majority of residents identify as white British and, in the north areas particularly, there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation. It is well served by public transport; there are several bus services through the area and Felling lies on the Tyne and Wear Metro line and there are stations at Gateshead Stadium and Felling. Felling town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a £13.5 million regeneration project, with the demolition of the old Co-op supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units, which now run parallel to a new Asda superstore.The long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen listed buildings, several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed. It is served by several schools, though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low. Leisure provision is good, with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities. Gateshead International Stadium lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from Felling, including former England international Chris <b>Waddle,</b> as does award-winning author David Almond.|$|E

It was at this property, located in a crime-ridden area of Detroit that she established Mother <b>Waddles</b> Perpetual Mission for Saving Souls of All Nations. Its name was later shortened to: Mother <b>Waddles</b> Perpetual Mission. Fires, financial setbacks and other problems forced the mission to move several times over the years, but its spirit and goals remained the same. Thousands of needy people walked through {{the doors of the}} mission. At times over 200 volunteers were available to help provide for and assist the needy.|$|R
5|$|Ireland's group {{opponents in}} Italia '90 were England, Egypt and the Netherlands. Charlton felt that England's four-man midfield of <b>Waddle,</b> Barnes, Bryan Robson and Paul Gascoigne {{did not offer}} enough {{protection}} to the back four, and he was proved correct when Kevin Sheedy cancelled out Gary Lineker's opener to secure a 1–1 draw in the group opener at the Stadio Sant'Elia. A poor performance against a negative Egyptian side at the Stadio La Favorita meant that neither side scored a goal in a dour draw. They ended the group with a 1–1 draw with the Dutch, Niall Quinn cancelling out Ruud Gullit's opener in the 71st minute, after which both sides settled for a stalemate as a draw meant that both qualified ahead of Egypt. Ireland then defeated Romania in the Second Round match at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris which went to penalties after a 0–0 draw, before the whole team had a meeting Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Ireland eventually {{went out to the}} hosts, Italy, 1–0 in the quarter-finals at the Stadio Olimpico. A lapse of concentration meant that Italy's Salvatore Schillaci scored on 38 minutes, and Ireland failed to build up enough chances to find the equalising goal. After returning to Dublin over 500,000 people turned out to welcome the team back.|$|E
5|$|The {{build up}} to Euro 1988 in West Germany was far from ideal, as key player Mark Lawrenson was forced to retire after {{injuring}} his Achilles tendon, Liam Brady picked up a serious knee injury and Mark Kelly was also injured. The first match of the tournament was against England at the Neckarstadion, and Charlton reasoned that {{the threat posed by}} English wingers Chris <b>Waddle</b> and John Barnes could be nullified by allowing the English defence to feel comfortable on the ball without allowing them a pass; this made the build-up play slow and containable. His game-plan worked and Ireland claimed a 1–0 win after Ray Houghton secured an early lead. He then compensated for a series of injuries by playing Ronnie Whelan and Kevin Sheedy in central midfield, and was rewarded with a great performance and a good point in a 1–1 draw with the Soviet Union at the Niedersachsenstadion, Whelan scoring the goal. To qualify they only needed a point against the Netherlands at the Parkstadion, and Charlton devised a time-wasting plan with goalkeeper Packie Bonner that he was forced to abandon after referee Horst Brummeier was less than impressed. Ireland lost the game 1–0 after Wim Kieft scored an 82nd-minute goal. England and Ireland were eliminated whilst Netherlands and the Soviet Union qualified – both teams would go on to contest the final.|$|E

25|$|The Bellefonte & Buffalo Run and Nittany Valley & Southern were merged on March 16, 1885, to {{form the}} Buffalo Run, Bellefonte and Bald Eagle Railroad, under the {{presidency}} of James A. Beaver. The new company began to lay rail on the grade in April 1886, and began shipping ore from Lambourn Bank (near <b>Waddle)</b> to the McCoy & Linn furnace in Bellefonte in January 1887. The Collins brothers also invested in local ore banks, including those at Red Bank. This was reached by a branch from Mattern Junction, on the horseshoe curve near <b>Waddle.</b> To smelt the ore, they began building Bellefonte Furnace near the new railroad's enginehouse in Coleville, {{on the outskirts of}} Bellefonte. The furnace was put in blast on February 1, 1888, but the local supplies of ore proved insufficient to sustain it and it was shut down in February 1891. Part of the Red Bank Branch would be abandoned in 1894.|$|E
25|$|Bellefonte Furnace {{closed on}} December 21, 1910, and Nittany Furnace in 1911. Their last {{contribution}} to the railroad's prosperity was the huge heaps of slag accumulated at the furnace sites: this was shipped over the Bellefonte Central to the PRR for use in construction projects. While the loss of furnace traffic would ultimately prove fatal to the Central RR of PA, the Bellefonte Central had found new sources of revenue. The McNitt-Huyett Lumber Company opened a mill at <b>Waddle</b> in 1909 and built an extensive network of 36inch (91.44cm) gauge track into the Scotia area, dual-gauging the Scotia branch and making use of the abandoned rights-of-way from the area's iron-mining heyday. The local timber was soon exhausted, and the branches to Mattern Bank and Scotia were abandoned in 1915. However, McNitt-Huyett built further extensions, and continued to haul logs to the <b>Waddle</b> mill until about 1919. Furthermore, high calcium limestone deposits in Bald Eagle Mountain, {{on the north side}} of the Buffalo Run valley, were now being exploited, much of their production going to steel mills in Pittsburgh. These quarries, eventually consolidated under the management of the Chemical Lime Company, would replace the iron furnaces as the principal generators of traffic on the Bellefonte Central.|$|E

After a short delay the lighting was restored, but Milan had returned to their dressing room and refused to return to complete the game.
