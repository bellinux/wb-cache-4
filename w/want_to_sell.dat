5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E

5|$|Rosenborg started laying {{plans for}} further {{construction}}, at first looking at {{construction of a}} new grandstand on the east end. In May 1998, Lerkendal Eiendom AS, owned 44% by Rosenborg, was established to build three new grandstands, including removing the running track to make it a football-only stadium. An alternative was to move and build an all-new stadium at Ranheim. Following the announcement of the Ranheim plans, Mayor Anne Kathrine Slungård stated that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> Lerkendal, as she wanted public ownership of cultural infrastructure. In April 1999, Trondheim Municipality's chief of administration, Knut Sæther, recommended that the municipality sell Lerkendal to Rosenborg, who would then along with private investors be free to construct the necessary facilities. At the time, the municipality estimated the value of Lerkendal to between NOK50 and 100 million. The football district stated they were in favor of conversion of Lerkendal, and that they feared that if Rosenborg moved Lerkendal would incur high costs on the municipality, giving Granåsen {{as an example of a}} little used skiing facility which used half the municipal funding for sports venues.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{persistence}} of feudalism and the land enclosures of the 19th century the ownership of most land is concentrated in relatively few hands (some 350 people own about half the land). In 2003, as a result, the Scottish Parliament passed a Land Reform Act that empowered tenant farmers and communities to purchase land even if the landlord did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b>|$|E
25|$|The other {{buildings}} of the Arc, the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, the Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts, and the Seat of the International Teaching Centre, were completed in 1982, 1999 and 2000 respectively. The fifth and yet to be built building, the International Bahá'í library, is planned to be eventually built at {{the eastern end of}} the Arc, but the owner does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the land.

25|$|Seduction of the Innocent also {{analyzed}} the advertisements {{that appeared in}} 1950s comic books and the commercial context in which these publications existed. Wertham objected to not only {{the violence in the}} stories but also the fact that air rifles and knives were advertised alongside them. Wertham claimed that retailers who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> material with which they were uncomfortable, such as horror comics, were essentially held to ransom by the distributors. According to Wertham, news vendors were told by the distributors that if they did not sell the objectionable comic books, they {{would not be allowed to}} sell any of the other publications being distributed.|$|E

25|$|Desperate {{for a new}} {{high-tech}} combat aircraft, between late 1990 and 1993 the PAF {{evaluated the}} European Panavia Tornado MRCA (multi-role combat aircraft) and rejected it. The Mirage 2000E and an offer from Poland for the supply of MiG-29 and Su-27 were also considered but nothing materialised. In 1992 the PAF again looked at the Mirage 2000, reviving a proposal from the early 1980s to procure around 20–40 aircraft, but again a sale did not occur because France did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> a fully capable version due to political reasons. In August 1994 the PAF was offered the Saab JAS-39 Gripen by Sweden, but again the sale did not occur because 20% of the Gripen's components were from the U.S. and Pakistan was still under U.S. sanctions.|$|E
25|$|At the Commission's {{organizational}} {{meeting on}} July 1, 1889, Interior Secretary Noble directed the Commission to begin {{negotiations with the}} Cherokees for cession of the Outlet. The majority of Cherokees did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the Outlet land, and Chief Mayes was focused on potential increase in tribal income by hiking taxes to cattlemen. Lucius Fairchild and the Commission first arrived in Tahlequah on July 29, and made an offer for the Outlet on August 2. Commission efforts did not bear fruition, and the Cherokees were notified on December 27, 1889, that the Commission's offer was to be withdrawn. At the urging of Noble and Fairchild, President Harrison issued a proclamation on February 17, 1890 banning all cattle and livestock from the Outlet, and ordering removal of any existing cattle and livestock no later than October 1, 1890, eliminating Cherokee income from the Outlet.|$|E
25|$|PennDOT {{also tried}} {{acquiring}} a local pizza shop, Pizza Dude, {{for the southern}} end of the new right-of-way, but the owner didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the property since it would potentially lose business from the college students as well as no other suitable property nearby that would adequately replace his old building, a former Burger Chef location. PennDOT and the owner agreed to a compromise in which the owner got to stay on his property, but had to tear down the front portion of the building (which, for the time being, eliminated seating at the building) so that the right-of-way would have enough clearance from the building. The owner also gave up a portion of his parking lot, but the building itself would be protected by a grandfather clause requiring a certain length between a road and a building since it was a pre-existing building. In 2010, Pizza Dude moved on its own to downtown Beaver Falls, and the building is currently vacant.|$|E

25|$|Following the Oslo Airport {{localization}} {{controversy in}} the 1980s and early 1990s, Parliament decided to locate the new main airport for Eastern Norway at Gardermoen, north of Oslo. This caused Buskerud, Vestfold and Telemark to grow further from the main airport, strengthening the regional position of Torp. By 1990, the airport was again losing money, {{with a loss of}} NOK2.1 million, but the passenger numbers were up to 137,279. The debate about ownership woke again in 1992, this time with the Civil Aviation Administration considering if it should purchase part of or all of the airport. In 1992 the airport had 142,983 passengers, and the Civil Aviation Administration estimated that the airport would have 280,000 passengers following the closing of Fornebu in 1998. Local politicians did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the whole airport to the state, and the Civil Aviation Administration was not interested in purchasing part of the airport, so a sale did not go through.|$|E
25|$|While a {{large number}} of Dvořák's works were given opus numbers, these did not always bear a logical {{relationship}} to the order in which they were either written or published. To achieve better sales, some publishers such as N. Simrock preferred to present budding composers as being well established, by giving some relatively early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvořák deliberately provided new works with lower opus numbers to be able to sell them outside contract obligations to other publishers. An example is the Czech Suite which Dvořák didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> to Simrock, and had published with Schlesinger as Op. 39 instead of Op. 52. In this way it could come about that the same opus number was given to more than one of Dvořák's works; for example the opus number 12, which was assigned, successively, to: the opera King and Charcoal Burner (1871), the Concert Overture in F (1871, derived from the opera), the String Quartet No. 6 in A minor (1873), the Furiant in G minor for piano (1879), and the Dumka in C minor for piano (1884). In yet other cases, a work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers.|$|E
25|$|Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial {{candidate}} (and the late Congressman Flood's nephew), Harry F. Byrd supported creation of Shenandoah National Park, as did his friend William E. Carson, a businessman {{who had become}} Virginia's first chairman of the Commission on Conservation and Development. Development of the western national parks had assisted tourism, which produced jobs, which Byrd and local politicians supported. The land that became Shenandoah park was scenic, mountainous, and had also lost about half of its trees to the Chestnut blight (which was incurable and affected trees as they reached maturity). However, it had been held as private property for over a century, so many farms and orchards existed. After Byrd became governor and convinced the legislature to appropriate $1 million for land acquisition and other work, Carson and his teams (including surveyors and his brother Kit who was Byrd's law partner) {{tried to figure out}} who owned the land. They found that it consisted of more than 5,000 parcels, some of them inhabited by tenant farmers or squatters (who were ineligible to receive compensation). Some landowners, including wealthy resort owner George Freeman Pollock and Luray realtor and developer L. Ferdinand Zerkel, had long wanted the park created and had formed the Northern Virginia Park Association to win over the national park selection committee. However, many local families who had lived in the area for generations (especially people over 60 years old) did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> their land, and some refused to sell at any price. Carson promised that if they sold to the state, they could still live on their homesteads {{for the rest of their}} lives. Carson also lobbied the new President Herbert Hoover, who bought land to establish a vacation fishing camp near the headwaters of the Rapidan River (and would ultimately donate it to the park as he left office; it remains as Rapidan Camp).|$|E

500|$|When Harry Saltzman {{gained the}} {{rights for the}} novel, he {{initially}} did not go through with the project. Instead, Albert R. [...] "Cubby" [...] Broccoli wanted {{the rights to the}} novels and attempted to buy them from Saltzman. Saltzman did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the rights to Broccoli and instead they formed a partnership to make the films. A number of Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding them [...] "too British" [...] or [...] "too blatantly sexual". Eventually the two received authorisation from United Artists to produce Dr. No, to be released in 1962. Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: Danjaq, which was to hold the rights to the films, and Eon Productions, which was to produce them. The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975, when tensions during the filming of The Man with the Golden Gun led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists.|$|E
