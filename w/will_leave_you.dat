According to Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork, the song [...] "may be the album’s best track overall", citing [...] "its satisfyingly filthy electro skronk", while giving the album an average review; on a similar note, Arnold Pan of PopMatters defined the song as [...] "the album’s most viscerally powerful number" [...] citing that [...] "that’s music that sounds just as {{at home in the}} sacred place of a vast cathedral {{as it is in the}} virtual vacuum of cyberspace". Gareth James of Clash praised the album and stated that [...] "when the machine-gun beats do break through on [...] "Mutual Core", they’re augmented by a hymnal organ riff and a soaring, unprocessed and unleashed vocal which <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> breathless".|$|E

[...] Likewise, Marc Saltzman of The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it four stars out of five and stated that, [...] "One of the game's greatest assets is its intuitive control scheme. Novice and seasoned players will be able to pick up and play with little trouble. There are customizable options for manual or automatic swing modes." [...] However, the only negative review came from Alex Porter of Maxim, who gave it a score of four out of ten, saying, [...] "Golfing game standards like club selection, power meter, and control of backspins and topspins satisfy, but the sometimes-clunky controls and confusing camera perspectives <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> teed-off." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha was {{positive}} in his review. In his opinion, the episode {{never failed to}} deliver and [...] "acts {{as a tribute to}} everything Russell T Davies put in place when he resurrected the series in 2005." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "fast-moving, bursting [...] excitement" [...] and said that it contained [...] "everything you would expect to see from an adventure [...] all companions and a new Dalek empire" [...] and [...] "acts as the ultimate climax to four years of storytelling and <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> with goose bumps for the full 42 minutes." [...] Blair was impressed about how Torchwood and Doctor Who crossed over when their original target demographics dictated it [...] "should never have happened", and commended scenes that depicted Gwen's concern for her husband Rhys, Ianto watching The Paul O'Grady Show, and Sarah's and Jack's emotional response to the Dalek transmission. Although his review {{was positive}}, he did criticise two parts of the episode: the concept of [...] "time-lock" [...] the Time War was questioned because the Time Lords were annihilated in the conflict; and he complained that the Doctor's phone number was out of service.|$|E
500|$|Brian Moylan of The Guardian {{wrote that}} the visuals were [...] "absolutely stunning", and that the stories {{contained}} [...] "a certain darkness to it that is both mellow and twee at the same time, with {{a fair amount of}} anxiety creeping around the edges".

Kevin McDonough of the Illinois Daily Journal criticized some of the writing, but summed it up as [...] "an ambitious cartoon" [...] for both younger and older audiences. Jason Bree of the website Agents of Geek called the miniseries [...] "the greatest thing Cartoon Network has ever produced". Kevin Johnson, writing for The A.V. Club, praised the series, giving it an A, saying that [...] "with such a perfect blend of mood, atmosphere, story, and characterization, Over the Garden Walls 10-episode run <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> wanting more, but like every great fairy tale, it's a story that knows when it's over." ...|$|E

500|$|Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine {{stated that}} the album is [...] "Madonna's most purely beat-driven album since her self-titled 1983 debut" [...] and [...] "easily her finest effort since Ray of Light." [...] Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times called the album [...] "exuberant." [...] Christian John Wikane from PopMatters commented that the album [...] "proved that Madonna, {{approaching}} 50 years-old, is a vital force in the ever-expansive landscape of popular music." [...] Joan Morgan from The Village Voice noted that [...] "ith Confessions on a Dance Floor, Madonna at long last finds her musical footing. Easily dance record of the year, Confessions is an almost seamless tribute to the strobe-lit sensuality of the '80s New York club scene that gave Madge her roots, which she explores with compelling aplomb." [...] Josh Tyrangiel from Time magazine commented that [...] "In dance music, words exist to be repeated, twisted, obscured and resurrected. How they sound in the moment {{is far more important}} than what they mean, and Madonna knows that better than anyone. Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments.

A reviewer for Kidsreads.com said, [...] "This crisply-paced fantasy <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> hungry for the four additional Harry books that J.K. Rowling is working on. Harry's third year is a charm. Don't miss it." [...] Kirkus Reviews did not give a starred review but said, [...] "a properly pulse-pounding climax...The main characters and the continuing story both come along so smartly...that the book seems shorter than its page count: have readers clear their calendars if they are fans, or {{get out of the way}} if they are not." [...] Martha V. Parravano also gave a positive review for The Horn Book Magazine, calling it [...] "quite a good book." [...] In addition, a Publishers Weekly review said, [...] "Rowling's wit never flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world...or tossing off quick jokes...The Potter spell is holding strong.|$|E
500|$|The elderly Ian Smith {{lived in}} an unassuming house in Harare where, {{according}} to David Blair, [...] "the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked up the drive would be invited in for tea". He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994. He insisted {{that he would never}} leave Zimbabwe. [...] "Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid," [...] a friend reported him saying. [...] "Show you are not budging and the government <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> alone." [...] He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, The Great Betrayal, to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister, and praised Nelson Mandela, calling him Africa's [...] "first black statesman". Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. [...] "They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news," [...] Josephine Fisher records. Not all of the country's whites admired Smith, however; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.|$|E
