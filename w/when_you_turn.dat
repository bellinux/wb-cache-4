500|$|As the war winds down, Tucker has a {{dream of}} finally {{building}} the [...] "car of the future." [...] The [...] "Tucker Torpedo" [...] will feature revolutionary safety designs including disc brakes, seat belts, a pop out windshield, and head lights which swivel <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn.</b> [...] Tucker hires young designer Alex Tremulis {{to help with the}} design and enlists New York financier Abe Karatz to arrange financial support. Raising the money through a stock issue, Tucker and Karatz acquire the enormous Dodge Chicago Plant to begin manufacturing. [...] Abe hires Robert Bennington to run the new Tucker Corporation on a day-to-day basis.|$|E
500|$|Stafford's {{music has}} been {{referenced}} in popular culture. Her recording of [...] "Blues in the Night" [...] features in a scene of James Michener's novel The Drifters (1971), while a Marine Corps Sergeant Major in Walter Murphy's The Vicar of Christ (1979) hears a radio broadcast of her singing [...] "On Top of Old Smoky" [...] shortly before a battle in Korea. Commenting on the latter reference for his 1989 book Singers and the Songwhich includes a chapter about Staffordthe author Gene Lees says it [...] "somehow sets Stafford's place in the American culture. You're getting pretty famous when your name turns up in crossword puzzles; you are woven into a nation's history <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> up in its fiction." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} critics cited the album as {{a return to}} the band's roots. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said, [...] "Nearly 15 years after Ten, Pearl Jam finally {{returned}} to the strengths of their debut with 2006's Pearl Jam, a sharply focused set of impassioned hard rock." [...] Vedder said, [...] "It's easily the best stuff we've done but also some of the hardest stuff. It's very aggressive, because again, it's kind of a product of what it's like to be an American these days. It's pretty aggressive, especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> it loud." [...] Gossard added that after many experimental albums, Pearl Jam was [...] "like a coming together again in terms of accepting our natural strengths and also incorporating the best of our experiments".|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be foolish," [...] she laughed. [...] "I decline {{absolutely}} {{to believe}} that you had a single thought of me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> in here. Do you mind if I say that I prefer not to believe it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is capital," [...] Surajah said. [...] "I {{could not}} think what <b>you</b> were doing, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> round {{the corner of the}} fort and made for the village, instead of going the other way. But {{where did you get that}} gun from?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll do," [...] Mr. Parker declared. [...] "Now tell me: <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> out <b>you</b> knew {{perfectly}} well that a broken leg or a broken arm--perhaps a cracked skull--was a distinct possibility. Did {{you think about this}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went into the game? Did you think about it while you were playing?" ...|$|R
500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> black", the frontman [...] "sang in {{what has to be}} the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and let me do whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound like everything I had been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> on the station".|$|E
2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem to find yourself in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} architecturally {{remarkable}} about Sir Patrick's house. Ham Farm possessed neither {{the splendor of}} Windygates nor the picturesque antiquarian attraction of Swanhaven. It was a perfectly commonplace English country seat, surrounded by perfectly commonplace English scenery. Snug monotony welcomed <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went in, and snug monotony met <b>you</b> again <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> {{to the window and}} looked out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. But mud don't break any bones; does it? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> {{against us}} I {{had to be}} down on you, and I was down upon you;--that's just about all of it. Now you're coming among us again, and so I come to you with a calumet of peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, Mrs. Temple!" [...] I cried, {{lifting up}} in bed. And to my astonishment she was silenced, {{looking at me}} in amazement. [...] "You had your vengeance when I came to <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> from me with a lift of your {{shoulders}} at the news of my father's death. And now--" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS. Oh, I don't mean accidents. But, you know, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn,</b> it does creak so awfully. I shouldn't mind myself; but the baby-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{like the}} spirit of a shadow, isn't it?" [...] whispered Anne. [...] "You can see it so plainly {{haunting}} your side when you look ahead; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> and look at it--it's gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then that is soon settled. Out of our path, Olaf, {{and look}} the other way. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> your head again {{there will be no}} Empress to trouble you, except one of your own choosing." ...|$|E
25|$|When I was 11, I won 50 {{pounds in}} a {{competition}} for writing this program that made sound on a ZX81. You couldn't make sound on a ZX81, but I played around with machine code and found some codes that retuned the TV signal {{so that it}} made this really weird noise <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> the volume up.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does any}} sane person want with those great big houses?" [...] she demanded. [...] "If you go downstairs after dark you're covered with black beetles, and the {{electric}} lights always goin' out. What {{would you do}} if spiders came out of the tap <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> on the hot water?" [...] she demanded, fixing her eye on Helen.|$|R
6000|$|... ("Not an atom of risk." [...] Oh, genial and courteous host, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> up {{next day}} blacker than any sweep that ever swept, with a neat, {{half-inch}} gash on your forehead--won by cutting a [...] "stook" [...] and getting caught by a bounding coal-knob--how long and earnestly did you endeavour {{to show that}} [...] "stook-cutting" [...] was an employment as harmless and unexciting as wool-samplering!) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack rabbit can {{get as much}} as a turnip to eat?" [...] {{finished}} Randy gayly. [...] "Spouter, if you {{are going}} to orate, why don't you stand on the table <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> on the spigot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are in Devonshire all right," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "You will realise it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> {{out of my}} {{avenue and}} face the hills. You see, you've dropped down from the fairyland of 'up over' to the nesting place of the owls and the gulls." ...|$|E
6000|$|Emily {{looked up}} from the manuscript. She felt Cecilia's arm tenderly caressing her. She heard Cecilia say, [...] "My poor dear, there is one last trial of your courage still to come. I am afraid of {{what you are going to}} read, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> to the next page. And yet--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a liar, Uncle Coetzee," [...] was {{the cool}} answer. [...] "English with the English, Boer with the Boer. You blow neither hot nor cold. Be careful lest I show you up. I know {{you and your}} talk. Do you {{remember}} {{what you were saying}} to the Englishman Niel in the inn-yard at Wakkerstroom <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> and saw me? I heard, and I do not forget. You know what happens to a 'land betrayer'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "M. le Comte," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "will you let {{me remind}} you that the other day <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> me out of your house like a dishonest servant, you would not allow me to say a single word in my own justification? The man on whose word you {{condemned}} me then without a hearing, is a scatter-brained braggart who you yourself must know is not a man to be trusted and [...] . . ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{no doubt}} {{that it would be}} advisable," [...] Carroll {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "As I've pointed out, you have {{spent a good deal of}} the cash <b>you</b> got <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> the Clermont over to the company. In fact, that's one reason why I didn't try to head off this timber-hunting scheme. You can't spend much over the search, and if the spruce comes up to expectations, you ought to get it back. It would be a fortunate change, after your extravagance in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Under the streets, in the sewers, in the wires, in the telephones, {{there is}} {{something}} alive; {{is that what you}} mean? In things like dust-carts, and men mending roads? You feel that all the time when you walk about London, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> on a tap and the water comes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned to}} the doctor again. She spoke to him, not as if she {{expected}} him to understand her, but because {{she had to say}} these things which burthened her mind to someone. [...] "I have done hundreds of sketches. My room is littered with them. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> them over he seems to be lurking among them. But not one of them is like him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something animates him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> his crank," [...] {{replied the}} King. [...] "I {{do not know}} if it is life or what it is or how it happens that the Little Pink Bear can answer {{correctly}} every question put to him. We discovered his talent a long time ago, and whenever we wish to know anything--which is not very often--we ask the Pink Bear. There is no doubt whatever, madam, that Ugu the Magician has your dishpan, and if you dare to go to him, {{you may be able to}} recover it. But of that I am not certain." ...|$|E
5000|$|Luke 22: [...] Simon, Simon, behold, Satan {{demanded to}} have you, {{that he might}} sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>turned</b> again, {{strengthen}} your brothers.|$|R
6000|$|... "One can't {{think of}} everything," [...] said Miss Pilbeam, [...] "but, of course, {{we ought to}} have thought of the mate getting uneasy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>turn</b> up last night, and going to the police-station with a {{description}} of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there was}} a time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> to me, before I thought of you! I don't reproach you, for even now I feel that the ignorant and cold {{darkness}} that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me by that letter--valentine you call it--would have been worse than my knowledge of you, though it has brought this misery. But, I say, {{there was a}} time when I knew nothing of you, and cared nothing for you, and yet you drew me on. And if you say you gave me no encouragement, I cannot but contradict you." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{trouble is}} sore indeed <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> away {{and will not}} comfort us. How long the dawn seems coming when we cannot sleep! Oh! those hideous nights when we toss and turn in fever and pain, when we lie, like living men among the dead, staring out into the dark hours that drift so slowly {{between us and the}} light. And oh! those still more hideous nights when we sit by another in pain, when the low fire startles us every now and then with a falling cinder, and the tick of the clock seems a hammer beating out the life that we are watching.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had to pass}} by Perry's little house. His Mariana was {{standing}} at the gate. We got there at five minutes past seven. She had on a blue wrapper, and her hair was pulled back smooth like little girls do when they want to look grown-folksy. She didn't see us till we got close, for she was gazing up the other way. Then she backed around, and saw Perry, and a kind of a look scooted around over her face--danged if I can describe it. I heard her breathe long, just like a cow <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> her calf in the lot, and she says: 'You're late, Perry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In truth, yes!" [...] cried Nigel, {{and in a}} flash {{the dark}} eyes of Mary Buttesthorn rose before him, and he heard her low, sweet, earnest voice as he had heard it that night when they brought her frailer sister back from Shalford Manor, a voice which made all that was best and noblest in a man thrill within his soul. [...] "Yet, bethink you, archer, that what a woman loves in man is not his gross body, but rather his soul, his honor, his fame, the deeds with which he has made his life beautiful. Therefore you are winning love as well as glory <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> to the wars." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jorgensen had it {{written into}} his {{contract}} at WNEW {{that he was}} the only one who could use a TelePrompTer, and this meant that when he was debriefing a reporter on set, the reporter would have to constantly look at his notes. By contract, Jorgensen would always look steadily into the camera, projecting an air of power and confidence. He warred bitterly with station management, including Ted Kavanau, then news director, who says Jorgensen [...] "was a difficult guy, very moody, hardly talked to anybody, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> on that camera, he performed brilliantly. He had a voice that was like fate reaching out to you." ...|$|R
60|$|Finding it {{impossible}} to sleep, I lay there wondering a number of things: why, for instance, the Pullman sleeping-car blankets were unlike other blankets; why they were like squares cut out of cold buckwheat cakes, and why they clung to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>turned</b> over, and lay heavy on you without warmth; why the curtains before you {{could not have been}} made opaque, without being so thick and suffocating; why it would not be as well to sit up all night half asleep in an ordinary passenger-car as to lie awake all night in a Pullman. But the snoring of my fellow-passengers answered this question in the negative.|$|R
