40|$|The {{binarization}} of <b>wafer</b> <b>ID</b> {{image is}} one of the key techniques of <b>wafer</b> <b>ID</b> recognition system and its results influence the accuracy of the segmentation of characters and their identification directly. The process of binarization of <b>wafer</b> <b>ID</b> is similar to that of the car license plate characters. However, due to some unique characteristics, such as non-uniform illumination, the unsuccessive strokes of <b>wafer</b> <b>ID,</b> it is more difficult to make of binarization of <b>wafer</b> <b>ID</b> than the car license plate characters. In this paper, a <b>wafer</b> <b>ID</b> recognition scheme based on Star-shape filter is proposed to cope with the serious influence of uneven luminance. The testing results show that our proposed approach is efficient even in situations of overexposure and underexposure the <b>wafer</b> <b>ID</b> with high performance...|$|E
40|$|It {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} to produce larger diameter silicon CZ solar cells. However, greater thickness i anticipated to be necessary for larger diameter wafers to withstand wafering, cell processing, and handling. No means of quantifying this anticipated thickness increase isavailable to provide standards or guide for cell manufacturers. In this paper equations relating wafer thickness and diameter were derived by using fracture mechanics analysis. An analytical model {{was used as a}} guideline to estimate minimum silicon wafer thickness vs. diameter requirements for <b>ID</b> <b>wafering</b> in terms of fracture me-chanics parameters. The model also indicated the minimum wafer side support required forvarious wafer thickness at any diameter. Crystal growers have made efforts to grow large diameter silicon Czochralski (CZ) ingots, which could produce larger cells at lower cost. However, greater thickness was anticipated to be necessary for large diameter wafers to withstand the greater forces during wafering, cell processing, and handling. Most cell. manufacturers determine their silicon wafer thickness for unconventional sizes by trial and error. SEMI standards on these dimensional requirements for semi-conductor industries are neither cost-effective nor practical for solar cell industries. In order to meet low-cost solar array project goals, larger and thinner silicon wafers are needed. It is of-great importance to determine the min imum wafer thickness as a function of diameter. This equation will provide a guideline for the selection of min imum thickness of solar cells in various unconventional sizes. Fracture mechanics analysis was utilized to derive the equation described in this paper. It is anticipated that this analytical model can be used in estimating the silicon wafer thickness vs. diameter equirements for solar cells based upon fracture mechanics parame-ters. Fracture Mechanics Analysis Model Assume that a wafer with rigid side support is sub-jected to a cantilever force, as shown in Fig. 1, can be considered to represent he stress condition of a <b>wafer</b> during <b>ID</b> <b>wafering.</b> The maximum bending stress at the rigid support can be calculated b...|$|R
40|$|Inner {{diameter}} (<b>ID)</b> <b>wafering</b> of ingot rotation {{reduce the}} ID saw blade diameter was investigated. The blade thickness can be reduced, resulting in minimal kerf loss. However, significant breakage of wafers occurs during the rotation wafering as the wafer thickness decreases. Fracture mechanics {{was used to}} develop an equation relating wafer thickness, diameter and fracture behavior {{at the point of}} fracture by using a model of a wafer, supported by a center column and subjected to a cantilever force. It is indicated that the minimum allowable wafer thickness does not increase appreciably with increasing wafer diameter and that fracture through the thickness rather than through the center supporting column limits the minimum allowable wafer thickness. It is suggested that the minimum allowable wafer thickness can be reduced by using a vacuum chuck on the wafer surface to enhance cleavage fracture of the center core and by using 111 ingots...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{utilization of}} materials {{is critical to}} certain device applications such as silicon for photovoltaics or diodes and gallium-gadolinium-garnet for memories. A variety of slicing techniques has been investigated to minimize wafer thickness and wafer kerf. This paper {{presents the results of}} analyses of <b>ID</b> <b>wafering</b> of rotated ingots based on predicted fracture behavior of the wafer as a result of forces during wafering and the properties of the device material. The analytical model indicated that the minimum wafer thickness is controlled by the depth of surface damage and the applied cantilever force. Both of these factors should be minimized. For silicon, a minimum thickness was found to be approximately 200 x 10 - 6 th m for conventional sizes of rotated ingot wafering. Fractures through the thickness of the wafer rather than through the center supporting column were found to limit the minimum wafer thickness. The model suggested that the use of a vacuum chuck on the wafer surface to enhance cleavage fracture of the center supporting core and, with silicon, by using 111 -line-type ingots could have potential for reducing minimum wafer thickness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the wear}} {{behavior}} of the ID (inner diameter) saw blade in the cutting process of silicon ingot was observed with SEM. Its wear mechanism was discussed and {{the relation between the}} blade wear and vibration, deflection was analyzed. The results show that the blade worn manners include flatted diamond, micro-fractured diamond, macro-fractured diamond, pulled-out hole, tortoise-fractured bond, and polished bond. In the abnormal working stage of a blade, however, the working surface of the blade is displayed mainly with pulled out diamond, flatted diamond, macro-fractured diamond grains. Abnormal initial tension condition will induce severe vibration and deflection, and so then lots of diamond grits fractured or pulled out too early. Inroduction Crystal ingot slicing is the first machining process of IC manufacturing. The sliced surface quality would affect the following processes severely. ID (inner-diameter) slicing is widely used in crystal <b>wafering</b> currently. The <b>ID</b> saw blade plays important roles in the process of IC manufacturing. It is important to investigate the {{behavior of the}} ID saw blade slicing the crystal ingot. The researches on the behavior of the ID saw blade have been carried out mainly on stress and vibration analysis [1, 4], and manufacturing technology of ID saw blade [5, 7]. S.
