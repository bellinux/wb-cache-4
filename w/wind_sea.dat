25|$|On calm summer afternoons {{with little}} {{prevailing}} <b>wind,</b> <b>sea</b> breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms {{down the center}} of the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the sea breezes, and sometimes survive to move out over the water at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast sea breezes.|$|E

[...] Two-way coupled models allow the wave activity to feed back upon the atmosphere. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) coupled atmosphere-wave forecast system described below facilitates this through exchange of the Charnock parameter which controls the sea surface roughness.

60|$|Was {{there ever}} such a voyage! This morning, when I came on deck, I found nobody at the wheel. It was a startling sight--the great Elsinore, by the wind, under an Alpine range of canvas, every sail set from skysails to try-sails and spanker, {{slipping}} {{across the surface}} of a mild trade- <b>wind</b> <b>sea,</b> and no hand at the wheel to guide her.|$|E
60|$|They {{were ten}} days which I am {{not likely to}} forget. On the very day that the Eastern Star had cleared from the Thames, a furious easterly gale had sprung up, and blew on {{from day to day}} for the greater part of a week without the sign of a lull. Such a screaming, raving, long-drawn storm has never been known on the {{southern}} coast. From our hotel windows the sea view was all banked in haze, with a little rain-swept half-circle under our very eyes, churned and lashed into one tossing stretch of foam. So heavy was the wind upon the waves that little sea could rise, for the crest of each billow was torn shrieking from it, and lashed broadcast over the bay. Clouds, <b>wind,</b> <b>sea,</b> all were rushing to the west, and there, looking down at this mad jumble of elements, I waited on day after day, my sole companion a white, silent woman, with terror in her eyes, her forehead pressed ever against the window, her gaze from early morning to the fall of night fixed upon that wall of grey haze through which the loom of a vessel might come. She said nothing, but that face of hers was one long wail of fear.|$|E
60|$|He {{entered the}} boat, and pulled along the reefs to examine an inlet that Mr. Leach {{reported}} to have been seen, before he got the ship's head to the northward. Could an entrance be found at this point, the vessel might possibly be carried within the reef, and a favourite scheme of the captain's could be put in force, one to which he now attached the highest importance. A mile brought the boat up to the inlet, where Mr. Truck found the following appearances: The general formation of the coast in sight {{was that of a}} slight curvature, within which the ship had so far drifted as to be materially inside a line drawn from headland to headland. There was, consequently, little hope of urging a vessel, crippled like the Montauk, against <b>wind,</b> <b>sea</b> and current, out again into the ocean. For about a league abreast of the ship the coast was rocky, though low, the rocks running off from the shore quite a mile in places, and every where fully half that distance. The formation was irregular, but it had the general character of a reef, the position of which was marked by breakers, {{as well as by the}} black heads of rocks that here and there showed themselves above the water. The inlet was narrow, crooked, and so far environed by rocks as to render it questionable whether there was a passage at all, though the smoothness of the water had raised hopes to that effect in Mr. Leach.|$|E

6000|$|One {{has some}} {{difficulty}} in giving a reader accurate {{notions of the}} confusion of so awful a scene. The motion of the vessel was arrested suddenly, {{as it might be}} by a wall, and the whole fabric seemed to be shaken to dissolution. The very next roller that came in, which would have undulated in towards the land but for us, meeting with so large a body in its way, piled up and broke upon our decks, covering everything with water. At the same time, the hull lifted, and, aided by <b>wind,</b> <b>sea</b> and current, it set still further on the reef, thumping in a way to break strong iron bolts, like so many sticks of sealing-wax, and cracking the solid live-oak of the floor-timbers as if they were made of willow. The captain stood aghast! For one moment despair was painfully depicted in his countenance; then he recovered his self-possession and seamanship. He gave the order to stand by to carry out to windward the stream-anchor in the launch, and to send a kedge to haul out by, in the jolly-boat. Marble answered with the usual [...] "ay, ay, sir!" [...] but before he sent us into the boats, he ventured to suggest that the ship had bilged already. He had heard timbers crack, about which he thought there could be no mistake. The pumps were sounded, and the ship had seven feet water in her hold. This had made in about ten minutes. Still the captain would not give up. He ordered us to commence throwing the teas overboard, in order to ascertain, if possible, the extent of the injury. A place was broken out {{in the wake of the}} main-hatch, and a passage was opened down into the lower-hold, where we met the water. In the mean time, a South-Sea man we had picked up at Canton, dove down under the lee of the bilge of the ship. He soon came back and reported that a piece of sharp rock had gone quite through the planks. Everything tending to corroborate this, the captain called a council of all hands on the quarter-deck, to consult as to further measures.|$|E

40|$|Winds {{and waves}} data {{measured}} {{at a few}} locations along {{the west coast of}} India as well as wave model results were analysed to study the wave characteristics in the deep as well as nearshore regions during different seasons. During fair weather season, we can observe distinct and systematic diurnal variation in wave height and wave period, especially, simultaneous increase in wave height and decrease in wave period with increase in local wind speed. This is due to superimposition of <b>wind</b> <b>seas</b> generated by the sea breeze system with the pre-existing swells. The swells observed in the Arabian Sea are from SW direction during SW monsoon season and from SW/SSW and NW directions during both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The NW swells which occur during Shamal events show distinct characteristics such as an increase in wave height, decrease in swell period and a common propagation direction (northwest) for <b>wind</b> <b>seas</b> and swells. Also the swells generated at 400 S, propagate in the north Indian Ocean, and enter the Bay of Bengal without affecting the Arabian <b>Sea.</b> Fine resolution <b>winds</b> (say, MM 5 or WRF) are necessary to understand the effect of land-sea breeze system on wind-sea generation in the coastal regions.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of wind and}} wave data collected in the coastal region of Goa, west coast of India, during fair weather season reveals a distinct and systematic diurnal variation in wind speed, wave height and wave period, especially simultaneous increase in wave height and decrease in wave period with increase in local wind speeds due to sea breeze system. During a typical daily cycle, the wave height reaches its peak early in the afternoon, then it decays progressively back to the swell conditions within 5 or 6 hours. Measured wave spectra distinctly bring out salient features of deep water swell and <b>wind</b> <b>seas</b> generated by the local sea breeze. Numerical simulations reproduce the characteristics of this daily cycle. The exposure of Goa coast to long distant swells from the southwest and to the local <b>wind</b> <b>seas</b> from the northwest leads to complex cross-sea conditions...|$|R

The study shows that even though the location is in a gulf, the annual average value ([*]∼[*]  0. 84 m) of the significant wave height in this area is comparable to that along the coastal waters of the Indian subcontinent, but the annual maximum value ([*]∼[*]  1. 7  m) recorded is much less than that (3 to 5  m) observed in those regions. Also, large seasonal variations are not observed in the wave height.
