50|$|One {{situation}} in which the effect of a time limited warranty is different from the effect of a performance warranty is where the time limit exceeds to normal lifetime of the product. If a coat is designed to last two years, but has a 10-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, a buyer who wears the coat for 3 years and then finds it worn out {{would not be able to}} collect on the warranty. But it is different from a 2-year warranty because if the buyer starts wearing the coat 5 years after buying it, and finds it wears out a year later, the buyer would have a <b>warranty</b> <b>claim</b> in Year 6. On the other hand, a 10-year performance warranty would promise that the coat would last 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the crash disk are {{uncertain}} because of significant irregularities and gaps, noted in the NTSB report, in the manufacturing records of GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) and its suppliers. [...] Records found after the accident indicated that two rough-machined forgings having the serial number of the crash disk had been routed through GEAE manufacturing. Records indicated that Alcoa supplied GE with TIMET titanium forgings for one disk with the serial number of the crash disk. Some records show that this disk “was rejected for an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication”, that an outside lab performed an ultrasound inspection of this disk, that this disk was subsequently returned to GE, and that this disk should have been scrapped. The FAA report stated “There is no record of <b>warranty</b> <b>claim</b> by GEAE for defective material and no record of any credit for GEAE processed by Alcoa or TIMET”. [...] GE records of the second disk having the serial number of the crash disk indicate that it was made with an RMI titanium billet supplied by Alcoa. Research of GE records showed no other titanium parts were manufactured at GE from this RMI titanium billet {{during the period of}} 1969 to 1990. GE records indicate that final finishing and inspection of the crash disk were completed on December 11, 1971. Alcoa records indicate that this RMI titanium billet was first cut in 1972 and that all forgings made from this material were for airframe parts. [...] If the Alcoa records were accurate, the RMI titanium could not have been used to manufacture the crash disk, indicating that the initially rejected TIMET disk with “an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication” was the crash disk. [...] CF6 engines like that containing the crash disk were used to power many civilian and military aircraft {{at the time of the}} crash. Due to concerns that the accident could recur, a large number of disks that were in service were examined by ultrasound for indications of defects. At least two “sister disks” were found to have defects like that of the crash disk. Prioritization and efficiency of inspections of the many engines under suspicion would have been aided by determination of the titanium source of the crash disk. Chemical analyses of the crash disk intended to determine its source were inconclusive. The NTSB report stated that if examined disks were not from the same source, “the records on a large number of GEAE disks are suspect. It also means that any AD (Airworthiness Directive) action that is based on the serial number of a disk could fail to have its intended effect because suspect disks could remain in service.” [...] The FAA report did not explicitly address the impact of these uncertainties on operations of military aircraft that might have contained a suspect disk.|$|E

40|$|Forecasting {{warranty}} {{claims are}} vitally important for manufacturers in preparing their fiscal plans {{as well as}} in managing their inventory. One of the widely used forecasting models is the non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), which assumes that the mean and the variance of the numbers of warranty claims at any given time interval are equal. However, this is not always the case. <b>Warranty</b> <b>claim</b> data often exhibit a phenomenon known as over-dispersion, which implies that the variance to mean ratio is larger than one. Furthermore, this ratio might change over time and can have a trend or a clearly discernible functional form, which has not yet been considered in the existing literature on warranty claims forecasting. This paper presents a <b>warranty</b> <b>claim</b> forecasting approach that tackles the problem of the dynamic over-dispersion exhibited in warranty claims data. It considers the application of both mixed NHPP and Cox process models to warranty claims and assumes that the intensity of the mixed NHPP follows a gamma distribution and the intensity of the Cox process follows a gamma process. <b>Warranty</b> <b>claim</b> data collected from an electronics product manufacturer are used validate the models, which show that these models outperform conventional NHPP models.

In existing literature, a number of techniques such as log-linear Poisson models, Kalman filter, time series models, and artificial neural network models have been developed. Nevertheless, one might find two weaknesses existing in these approaches: (1) they do not {{consider the fact that}} <b>warranty</b> <b>claims</b> reported in the recent months might be more important in forecasting future <b>warranty</b> <b>claims</b> than those reported in the earlier months, and (2) they are developed based on repair rates (i. e, the total number of claims divided {{by the total number of}} products in service), which can cause information loss through such an arithmetic-mean operation. To overcome the above two weaknesses, this paper introduces two different approaches to forecasting warranty claims: the first is a weighted support vector regression (SVR) model and the second is a weighted SVR-based time series model. These two approaches can be applied to two scenarios: when only claim rate data are available and when original claim data are available. Two case studies are conducted to validate the two modelling approaches. On the basis of model evaluation over six months ahead forecasting, the results show that the proposed models exhibit superior performance compared to that of multilayer perceptrons, radial basis function networks and ordinary support vector regression models...|$|R
