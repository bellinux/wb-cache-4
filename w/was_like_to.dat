The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. Vitti had wanted an episode centered on Mrs. Krabappel that examined what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have Bart as a student. It was the first episode of the show to feature her in a prominent role. The subplot where Homer tries to clean up his language was written partially {{in response to the}} complaints the show had been getting about the amount of cursing on the show. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

25|$|A shorter journey, the Pichi Richi Explorer, is {{a return}} service to Woolshed Flat departing from Quorn (32 {{kilometres}} return). Travel on this train is either in South Australian Railway carriages circa 1900 to 1915 hauled by a steam locomotive, or in a 1928 SAR diesel railcar. The use of older SAR rollingstock on this train replicates what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> travel by country rail in South Australia {{in the very early}} 1900s to the 1960s. Much of this rolling stock was in service until the end of narrow gauge passenger operations by the South Australian Railways.|$|E

How can one describe what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another self? For that matter, what can we know about what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ourselves? Hofstadter and Dennett's commentary suggest that self-knowledge is elusive, {{to say nothing of the}} experience of other minds.|$|R

25|$|While {{in prison}} he was {{transferred}} to the Bridgewater State Hospital. On March 22, 1984, he changed his name to Nathaniel Benjamin Levi Bar-Jonah. He gave several reasons for changing his name. Bar-Jonah told friends and relatives that he changed his name because he wanted to know what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be discriminated against and persecuted as a Jew. During a later interview with Dr. Michael Stone for the television show Most Evil, he claimed he was Jewish and wanted his name to reflect that. Later in the same year, Superior Court Judge Walter E. Steele ruled that Massachusetts had failed to prove that Bar-Jonah was dangerous and he was released before moving to Great Falls, Montana. During this time, Bar-Jonah confided in his psychiatrists that he had a deep fascination and curiosity with the taste of human flesh, and had innumerable murderous fantasies.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} 2011 greatly {{affected}} {{the writing process}} for the song, including the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in March, the death of electronic musician Rei Harakami in July and turmoil in Yamaguchi's personal life. Yamaguchi wanted both the song and Documentaly {{to act as a}} record of what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> live in the post-earthquake period of 2011 in Japan, so expressed all of these events while writing the song. While questioning what were distinct things about living in 2011, Yamaguchi was inspired to write lyrics about online opinions. He noted that in YouTube-style commentary, people posted their opinions primarily as reactions to other peoples' opinions, while the majority of people had a third-person view of the entire process. He felt that this series of comments upon comments was a very particular aspect of living in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{submissions}} began almost immediately, as did {{short story}} submissions with lesbian themes. Book reviews of current paperbacks were regular features, including a heated exchange in print between contributors to The Ladder and author Marijane Meaker as Ann Aldrich from 1957 to 1963. Meaker {{had written the}} immensely successful Spring Fire in 1952 under the name Vin Packer and was known to the Daughters of Bilitis. Meaker's books We Walk Alone from 1955 and We, Too, Must Love from 1958 were her version of Donald Webster Cory's The Homosexual in America, a nonfiction account published in 1951 about what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> live as a gay man in the US. Meaker's books, published by Gold Medal Books, were distributed all over the US, and gave people in remote places {{an idea of what}} it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> live as a lesbian. The books, however, were not particularly sympathetic to lesbians, and Del Martin and Barbara Grier took issue with Meaker's portrayals. They began to criticize the books in The Ladder and suggest that Meaker was expressing self-hatred in the books. Del Martin wrote to Meaker personally in 1958, giving her a free subscription to the magazine. Meaker's reach to women was much broader through the distribution of her books, and she received so much mail from women asking for resources and support that she was unable to respond to all of it, so she referred the letter writers to the Daughters of Bilitis. However, in print, Meaker responded to the open letters to her in The Ladder in her next book Carol in a Thousand Cities in 1960, by skewering the magazine's amateurish homemade appearance, fiction and poetry she did not appreciate, and the ideas presented in the magazine. Again, The Ladder responded, once more calling Meaker's loyalties into question. However negative Carol in a Thousand Cities was to The Ladder, it was major advertising for the DOB and letters poured in for them from all over the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
