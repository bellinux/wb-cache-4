5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E

30|$|First, {{to achieve}} a {{description}} of the academic user, some criteria for defining an academic were adopted. In this research, people <b>whose</b> current <b>job</b> was student (undergraduate or postgraduate) or professor (anyone in a teaching position) were considered academics.

Nonetheless, some participants <b>whose</b> current <b>job</b> was student/professor and another unrelated job were considered both academics and professionals.|$|R

5|$|Each Poor Law Union {{employed}} {{one or more}} relieving officers, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> it was {{to visit}} those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse.

5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the other end of the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Hamburg scene {{revolved}} around the Kaiserkeller, Top Ten, Star-Club, Beer-Shop, Mambo, Holle, Wagabond (pronounced vagabond in German) and the Pacific Hotel, {{as well as the}} less popular clubs like Grannies, the Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> was to entice customers inside, as the drinks were expensive (for Babycham and watered-down beer). Customers who would not, or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in Perth on 30 September 1914. He {{declined}} the offer of a commission, and was posted as a private to A Company of the newly formed 16th Battalion, 4th Brigade. Appointed {{to one of the}} unit's two machine gun crews, he was sent to Blackboy Hill Camp for training, where he became the gun No.2, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> it was to feed ammunition belts through the gun; Percy Black was No.1 and the pair soon became firm friends.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January, several incidents, {{including}} a couple exchanges of gunfire, {{suggested that the}} embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January. The embassy had just six Marine guards, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning.|$|E

5|$|The Chief Herald of Canada, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> is {{to oversee}} and direct all {{operations}} of the CHA, bears the main responsibility of granting arms, though the governor general {{has the authority to}} grant arms directly.

Since June 26, 2007, the office of chief herald has been held by Claire Boudreau, formerly Saint-Laurent Herald.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and the race for county sheriff pitted two incumbent city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for the next twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The second voyage was {{to reduce}} the {{garrison}} and replace HM Sloop Hound, John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton shallop Penguin, commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in Endeavour. Endeavour sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of Penguin, and four ship's carpenters <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> was to reassemble Penguin on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April Endeavour and Hound sailed for England with their crew. One of Penguin's crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.|$|E

5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> {{is to simply}} drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, {{although it may be}} acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} calm, swift Parliament foundered on {{the rocks}} of {{religious}} conflict. On 27 February James Morice, a Puritan Member of Parliament, proposed two new bills: one against the bishops of the Church of England, and the other against the Court of High Commission. Morice was placed under house arrest, and seven Members of Parliament were later arrested, but the bills remained in Parliament. They were defended by Francis Knollys, {{one of the few}} remaining Puritan Members of Parliament, while other Puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents. Coke and Cecil, the government's two strongest defenders in Parliament, made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills. Cecil first pointed out that the Queen had forbidden bills on religion; Parliament ignored him, and the bill went ahead. Coke, as Speaker of the House of Commons (<b>whose</b> <b>job</b> was to schedule any bills), conducted a delaying campaign, first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee; both suggestions were voted down by the Commons. Coke continued talking until the end of the Parliamentary day in a filibuster action, granting a day of delay for the government. Immediately afterwards, Coke was summoned by the Queen, who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty. The warning was accepted by the Commons, and no more action was taken on the two Puritan bills.|$|E

50|$|During this time, {{the valley}} was {{inhabited}} by numerous families, <b>whose</b> <b>jobs</b> changed {{depending on the}} season.
