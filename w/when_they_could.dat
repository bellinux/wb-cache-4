5|$|Adams {{was joined}} by his wife while in London; they {{suffered}} the stares and hostility of the Court, and chose to escape it <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> by seeking out Richard Price, minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church and instigator of the Revolution Controversy.|$|E
5|$|Both {{varieties}} {{were sold}} by the centennial commission for $1, and primarily went to citizens of Alabama; banks throughout the state vended them. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be sold, 5,000 of the plain variety were returned to the Mint and melted.|$|E
5|$|John Pomerleau, {{owner of}} Alternative Funeral Service {{which is located}} in the Algo Centre Mall said in July that more than 30 {{cremation}} urns were still trapped in the mall and it was unknown if or <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be recovered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{submarines}} had {{a maximum}} surface speed of 6.20 - 6.49 kn {{and a maximum}} submerged speed of 5.22 - 5.67 kn. <b>When</b> submerged, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> operate for [...] at 4 kn; <b>when</b> surfaced, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> travel [...] at 5 kn. They were fitted with six 100 cm mine tubes, twelve UC 120 mines, and one 8 mm machine gun. They was built by AG Vulcan Stettin or AG Weser Bremen and her complement was fourteen crew members.|$|R
50|$|They {{often use}} one {{microphone}} for performances, initially to imitate that era's girl groups, but later realizing the advantage <b>when</b> <b>they</b> found <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hear each other better, which helped them control the harmony balance. They also use costumes, make-up and choreography {{to re-create the}} effect.|$|R
50|$|The torpedo's {{relatively}} low speed was kept secret because, although U-boats could not outrun the torpedo <b>when</b> submerged, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> outrun {{it on the}} surface.|$|R
5|$|The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the {{original}} fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, attempted {{to build on the}} character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna’s struggle is external, Elsa’s is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schoemann {{patrolled the}} Skagerrak to inspect neutral {{shipping}} for contraband goods in October. The ship attempted {{to lay a}} minefield off the British coast {{on the night of}} 12/13 November, with two of her sisters, but had to turn back after she and Z6 Theodor Riedel suffered machinery breakdowns. She made another attempt on the night of 18 December to mine the Humber estuary, together with two other destroyers, but the German ships had to abandon the sortie <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not pinpoint their location with the required degree of precision. While patrolling in the Jade estuary on 23 December, she collided with her sister Z15 Erich Steinbrinck in a heavy fog. Hermann Schoemann covered minelaying sorties in January and February 1940, but spent most of March under repair for machinery problems.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{submarines}} {{were designed}} for a maximum surface speed of 11.5 kn and a submerged speed of 6.6 kn. <b>When</b> submerged, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> operate for [...] at 4.5 kn; <b>when</b> surfaced, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> travel [...] at 7 kn. UC III-class boats were fitted with six 100 cm mine tubes, fourteen UC 200 mines, three 50 cm torpedo tubes (one on the stern and two on the bow), seven torpedoes, and one 10.5 cm SK L/45 or 8.8 cm Uk L/30 deck gun. Their complement was twenty-six crew members.|$|R

5|$|Scientific Atlanta's first {{business}} {{focus was}} antennas for military and industrial use. Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not afford an automatic antenna pattern recorder, {{of which there}} was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within six months of the development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the firm had captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25 acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees on the payroll including 40 engineers.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{slowed by}} {{industrial}} action after the war, and was suspended on 21October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase {{the ship and}} have it re-converted to a battleship. The £2.5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the £1.5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship. The Royal Navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island, and the Admiralty approved the use of Eagle on 11 November. Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20April 1920. Only two of her boilers, converted to run on fuel oil only, could be used during the trials.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term, Ross {{was forced to}} {{intervene}} in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared there would be armed battles between the white supremacist Democrats (the Jaybirds) and the black men who had retained political power (who, with their white supporters, were known as Woodpeckers). At Garvey's request, Ross sent two militia companies, which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four Texas Rangers, including Sergeant Ira Aten, to quell the unrest. Violence erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an Assistant Attorney General and another militia company. Ross fired all the local civil officials and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, who had been killed in the firefight. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not agree on a candidate, Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the conflict.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that subtle cues of {{observation}} affect cooperation even when anonymity is explicitly assured. For instance, {{recent studies have shown}} that the presence of eyes increases cooperation on social economic tasks. Here we tested the effects of cues of observation on trusting behavior in a two-player trust game and the extent to which these effects are qualified by participants' own attractiveness. Although explicit cues of being observed (i. e. when participants were informed that the other player would see their face) tended to increase trusting behavior, this effect was qualified by the participants' other-rated attractiveness (estimated from third-party ratings of face photographs). Participants' own physical attractiveness was positively correlated with the extent to which they trusted others more <b>when</b> <b>they</b> believed <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be seen than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> believed <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be seen was. This interaction between cues of observation and own attractiveness suggests context-dependence of trusting behavior that is sensitive to whether and how others react to one's physical appearance...|$|R
60|$|They {{were all}} roused {{just before dawn}} by a {{squeaking}} and twittering noise. They threw on fresh logs, and as these blazed up <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see a cloud of bats flying overhead. They kept on going to the doorway, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> found <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not get through they retired with angry squeaks. The light was gradually breaking, {{and in a few}} minutes all had flown out through the opening. Harry and his brother followed them, and could see them flitting about the upper windows. Presently, as if by a common impulse, they poured in through the various openings.|$|R

5|$|During the off-season, while {{preparations}} were underway for the 1947 season, Grove was {{the subject}} of trade discussions. Most notably, White Sox manager Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president Bill Veeck discussed trading him for Indians pitcher Steve Gromek, but the deal was nixed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not come to an agreement. As the season began, Grove remained part of the rotation, which was led by Lopat and included Joe Haynes and Frank Papish. While Grove started off the season well, he struggled through the middle of the year, going from May 18 to August 2 without winning a game. As a result, he was benched, and finished the season with 19 starts in 25 pitching appearances. For the first time, Grove finished a full season with an ERA above 4.00. He ended the season with six wins, eight losses, a 4.44 ERA, and six complete games. Grove spent the off-season working in the men's furnishings department of Henry C. Lytton's department store in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, the Mongol leader Genghis Khan, once a vassal of the Jurchens, rose {{up against}} the Jin dynasty. In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty, the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications. Instead, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> the Mongols simply rode around the walls; an {{effective}} example of this tactic is in 1211, when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling. The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls, {{such as those in}} Gubeikou, often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them. The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass: instead of laying siege, the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates. In 1215, Genghis Khan besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing (modern-day Beijing). The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234. Western Xia had already fallen in 1227, and the Southern Song resisted the Mongols until 1279.|$|E
5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadron’s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot down. The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised {{that there was no}} hope of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not see it. At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about to change. As they turned around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E
60|$|The Nebraska men, of course, {{were not}} for Matteson; but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> found <b>they</b> <b>could</b> elect no avowed Nebraska man, they tardily {{determined}} to let him get whomever of our men he could, by whatever means he could, and ask him no questions.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{approach}} {{that has been}} considered {{is the use of}} organized institutions and government as the leaders for promoting conservation. However, these leaders can only be effective if they are trusted. Studies from previous crises where conserving resources was extremely necessary showed that people were more likely to obey energy restrictions and follow certain leaders <b>when</b> <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> trust the people directing them. [...] People need to understand that they are being encouraged to act a certain way out of necessity, and that they are not being misled.|$|R

5|$|Nelvana {{licensed}} Cardcaptor Sakura in North America, {{dubbed the}} series into English with Ocean Studios featuring Carly McKillip as Sakura, and released {{it under the}} name Cardcaptors. This version was heavily edited from the original Japanese version. The initial version of the dub covered all 70 episodes, although character names were changed, some Japanese text was changed to English, and controversial subjects such as same-sex relationships were edited out. The musical score was completely replaced with new music {{and some of the}} sound effects were replaced <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be separated into separate tracks, although the original opening and ending themes were dubbed into English. This version aired in Australia on Network Ten and Cartoon Network, in Ireland on RTÉ2, in the UK on CiTV and Nickelodeon, and in Canada on Teletoon (which also aired the episodes with a French dub). An alternative English dub of the series was produced by Omni Productions to air on Animax Asia and it has been shown entirely unedited and uncut making it very faithfully closer to the original Japanese version, which it broadcast on its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia.|$|E
