40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the technological economics of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery and recycling in UK. The {{major problem in}} <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recycling is still the removal of contraries, although technological developments have so far been able to remove some of them. The costs incurred by the local authorities in recovering <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> were investigated. Local authority costing {{was found to be}} inconsistent and many of them did not include all the relevant indirect costs and savings, so that many local authorities claimed to be making heavy losses in their operations. Full accounting incorporating all the relevant indirect costs and savings have shown that most local authorities incurred much smaller losses and in some cases profited from their <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery operations. A general computer model was developed to allow local authorities to check the viability of their on-going operations and another computer model was developed for an investment appraisal of a proposed <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery operation. Multiple regression models were developed to forecast the demand of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> in the short term and the long term. The cost to the mill in recycling <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> was also examined. <b>Waste</b> <b>paper</b> recycling can only be increased by improving demand for <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> based products.

40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>paper</b> {{stands for}} the major {{biodegradable}} organic fraction of most of municipal solid waste. The potential of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> for glucose production was investigated in this current work. The pretreatment was accomplished by first subjecting <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> to disintegration time (30 s), followed by ink removal of disintegrated <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> using an deinking agent. Concentrated acid hydrolysis of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> with sulfuric acid was optimized to maximize glucose conversion. The concentrated acid hydrolysis conditions for <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> (disintegrated time: 30 s, deinking agent loading: 15 ㎖) were optimized by using central composite design and response surface methodology. The optimization process employed a central composite design, where the investigated variables were acid concentration (60 ∼ 80 %), loading sulfuric acid (1 ∼ 5 ㎖) and reaction time (1 ∼ 5 h). All the tested variables were identified to have significant effects (p < 0. 05) on glucose conversion. The optimum concentrated acid hydrolysis conditions were acid concentration of 70. 8 %, loading sulfuric acid of 3. 2 ㎖ and a reaction time of 3. 6 h.

40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>paper</b> and {{cardboard}} {{is a potential}} resource for producing bioethanol. In this work, bioethanol production processes from various <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> (newspaper, office paper, cardboard and magazine) using two enzyme alternatives (Celluclast 1. 5 L supplemented with Novozyme 188 and Cellic Ctec 1) were evaluated from technological, economic and environmental standpoints. Laboratory experiments were conducted to analyse {{the composition of the}} <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> and to assess the carbohydrate yields from enzymatic saccharifications at relatively high-solids loading (15 % w/w). Kinetic models were adapted for the glucan and xylan hydrolyses in this study and were validated by experimental data. The kinetic models provide further insights on enzymatic hydrolysis at high-solids loadings and predictions of the enzymatic digestibilities of the four types of paper. The experimental data, together with published data, were applied in process design models using the simulation software ASPEN PLUSTM to explore the techno-economic aspects of potential conversions of <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> to bioethanol. The mass and energy flows and the pollutant emissions estimated from the process simulations were used in life cycle environmental analyses (LCAs) to provide insight on the potential environmental pros and cons of converting <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> to bioethanol. This research has demonstrated that several pathways to bioethanol production from <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> are economically and environmentally competitive with conventional petrol as a transport fuel. They can also offer environmentally favorable or neutral profiles when compared with the alternative <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> management options of recycling or incineration with energy recovery. Simplistic, general assumptions that converting <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> to bioethanol is either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ are not supported by this research. Instead, this study has demonstrated that detailed techno-economic and environmental profiling work, such as that carried out here, is essential to identifying the most beneficial approaches to developing valuable and environmentally favorable production of bioethanol from <b>waste</b> <b>papers.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Now all honest civilization, religion, law, and convention {{is an attempt to}} keep this force within beneficent bounds. What corrupts civilization, religion, law, and convention (and they are at present pretty nearly as corrupt as they dare) is the constant attempts made by the wills of individuals and classes to thwart the wills and enslave the powers of other individuals and classes. The powers of the parent and the schoolmaster, and of their public analogues the lawgiver and the judge, become instruments of tyranny in the hands of those who are too narrow-minded to understand law and exercise judgment; and in their hands (with us they mostly fall into such hands) law becomes tyranny. And what is a tyrant? Quite simply a person who says to another person, young or old, [...] "You shall do as I tell you; you shall make what I want; you shall profess my creed; you shall have no will of your own; and your powers shall be at the disposal of my will." [...] It has come to this at last: that the phrase [...] "she has a will of her own," [...] or [...] "he has a will of his own" [...] has come to denote a person of exceptional obstinacy and self-assertion. And even persons of good natural disposition, if brought up to expect such deference, are roused to unreasoning fury, and sometimes to the commission of atrocious crimes, by the slightest challenge to their authority. Thus a laborer may be dirty, drunken, untruthful, slothful, untrustworthy in every way without exhausting the indulgence of the country house. But let him dare to be [...] "disrespectful" [...] and he is a lost man, though he be the cleanest, soberest, most diligent, most veracious, most trustworthy man in the county. Dickens's instinct for detecting social cankers never served him better than when he shewed us Mrs Heep teaching her son to [...] "be umble," [...] knowing that if he carried out that precept he might be pretty well anything else he liked. The maintenance of deference to our wills becomes a mania which will carry the best of us to any extremity. We will allow a village of Egyptian fellaheen or Indian tribesmen to live the lowest life they please among themselves without molestation; but let one of them slay an Englishman or even strike him on the strongest provocation, and straightway we go stark mad, burning and destroying, shooting and shelling, flogging and hanging, if only such survivors as we may leave are thoroughly cowed {{in the presence of a}} man with a white face.
