So she started experimenting using just her vocals, giving away to the bridge being composed. After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a choir around September 1988. Both of them met with musician Andraé Crouch and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to [...] "find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what <b>we</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> and we liked what we heard." [...] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them what they needed to do during the recording session.

2500|$|Recording for the band's third studio album started {{relatively}} early, in February and March 2013, {{when the}} band spent a week-and-a-half with producer Malay.

Mandagi had been writing new ideas for songs during his stay in Los Angeles, {{while the rest of}} the band were at home in London, doing the same. While previously, the band made use of jam sessions to create new songs, the band opted instead to take different approaches to writing songs, such as combining various ideas, conceived by different members of the band, into single tracks. The band met up and held their first sessions at the La Casa Artist Residency, a recording studio situated in Byron Bay, New South Wales, and owned by American filmmaker Taylor Steele. Contrasting from a traditional recording studio, the residency was originally set up by Steele as a retreat for artists to spend time, between a few days to a few weeks, to [...] "find inspiration and make art, with Byron Bay as their muse." [...] The band spent a few weeks, over the course of two visits, at La Casa with Malay.

According to drummer Toby Dundas, the band's experience with Malay opened them up to the idea of collaborating with other songwriters; an idea the band had previously rejected. Dunas explained, [...] "if it had gone badly it might have left a bad taste in our mouths. But he bought something interesting to the table.
