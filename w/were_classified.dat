5|$|Both Smith and {{his wife}} were of mixed-race African and European ancestry. As he became {{economically}} successful, he built a house in a good neighborhood; in the 1860 census he and his family <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> in that neighborhood as white, whereas in 1850 they <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as mulatto. He served for nearly 20 years as the doctor at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York but, after it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in the New York Draft Riots, in which nearly 100 blacks were killed, Smith moved his family and practice out to Brooklyn for safety. The parents stressed education for their children. In the 1870 census, his widow and children continued to be classified as white.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the people}} in the labor force in the town over the age of16, the majority, 597 people or 66.1% of the population, were in the {{civilian}} work force, while 306 people, or 33.9%, of the population were not in the labor force at all. At the time of the Census, only nine people, or 1.0%, were unemployed, with none in the Armed Forces. Of the 588 residents employed age 16 and over, private-sector wage and salary workers accounted for 457 of them or 77.7%. Ninety-five people <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as federal government workers, or 16.2% of the population, with the self-employed making up 5.8% of the population or 34people.

5|$|Historically, {{all living}} things <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as either animals or plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not {{considered}} animals. Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant organelles, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the classification (taxonomy), phylogeny and evolution, structure (anatomy and morphology), or function (physiology) of plant life.|$|E
5|$|In 1775, Carl Linnaeus was {{the first}} to scientifically {{describe}} a halfbeak, Esox brasiliensis. In 1775 Peter Forsskål described two more species as Esox, Esox far and Esox marginatus. It was not until 1816 that Georges Cuvier created the genus Hemiramphus; from then on, all three <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as Hemiramphus. In 1859, Gill erected Hemiramphidae, deriving its name from Hemiramphus, the family's type genus. The name comes from the Greek hemi, meaning half, and rhamphos, meaning beak or bill.|$|E

5|$|The current stellar {{classification}} system {{originated in the}} early 20th century, when stars <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> from A to Q based {{on the strength of}} the hydrogen line. It thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature. Rather, it was more complicated; it strengthened with increasing temperature, it peaked near 9000K, and then declined at greater temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely resembled the modern scheme.|$|E

5|$|The empire's {{population}} was classified into white people, {{also referred to}} as Europeans, and non-white people, variously referred to as persons of colour, negros and natives. The largest ethnic grouping in the empire was Indians (including what are now Pakistanis and Bangladeshis), who <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> into a number of individual South Asian ethnic groups. The following table gives the population figures for white people and non-white, in the empire and its territories, in 1814 and 1901.|$|E

5|$|The race began for {{the second}} year in {{succession}} with a team time trial on one of Italy's islands, in this case Sicily (in 2007 it had been Sardinia). The route contained only four stages that were officially deemed mountain stages, but several of the seven intermediate stages contained selective climbs. The Giro had four time trials, three of which were individual and one a team event. Six stages <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as flat.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{combination of}} the M54 mount with the M3A1 Halftrack chassis was designated the M15A1 CGMC. A total of 1,052 were produced in 1943, and a further 600 in 1944. 100 M15s were shipped to the Soviet Union for use under the Lend-Lease policy. Both the M42 mount and M15 CGMC <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as obsolete in August 1946.|$|E
5|$|As a {{relatively}} rural environment {{in an increasingly}} urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists. One of the botanists was Richard Buxton {{who went on to}} write A Botanical Guide to Manchester. In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor. These {{turned out to be a}} previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed to a friend of Cribb's, the collector R. Wood, who had asked an expert to identify them. The moths <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as Pancalia woodiella (today Euclemensia woodiella) in Wood's honour.|$|E

5|$|Below centurion/decurion rank, junior {{officers}} in the Roman army were known as principales. An auxiliary cohort's ranks appear {{the same as in}} a legionary centuria. These were, in ascending order: tesserarius ("officer of the watch"), signifer (standard-bearer for the centuria), optio (centurion's deputy) and vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole regiment, from vexillum). In the turmae of cohortes equitatae (and of alae?), the decurion's second-in-command was probably known as a curator, responsible for horses and caparison. As in the legions, the principales, together with some regimental specialists, <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> in two pay-scales: sesquiplicarii ("one-and-a-half-pay men") and duplicarii ("double-pay men"). These ranks are probably most closely resembled by the modern ranks of corporal and sergeant respectively.|$|E
5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; {{he had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given {{at the bottom of}} the page.|$|E

Olds' class was given an abridged second class course of study until January 19, 1943, when it began an abridged first class course.|$|E

Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} nineteenth century, Megalosaurus {{was seen as}} the typical {{carnivorous}} dinosaur. If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these <b>were</b> <b>classified</b> under Megalosaurus, which thus began to function as a wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name.|$|E
