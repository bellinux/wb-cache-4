5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There’s few gentlemen {{that would}} have come down at all <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> asleep," [...] remarked Mr. Tasker, {{pocketing}} a shilling, when the captain’s back was turned.|$|R
50|$|This limpet lives {{lower in}} the {{intertidal}} zone than Cellana exarata, the black-foot opihi. They are found, strongly attached, sometimes with considerable force, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> to rocks or other hard substrates. They feed by grazing on algae.|$|R
50|$|Players may {{not catch}} the ball unless they are the goalkeeper (or a defender {{on the line for}} a penalty) and this must be {{released}} within three steps. Players may not kick the ball, but can drag the ball <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E
5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> in line and their fists raised level in front of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly {{in front of the other}} and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them.|$|E
50|$|The BeatBuddy is a {{drum machine}} {{in the form of}} a guitar pedal. Musicians control the beat live while playing <b>their</b> {{instrument}} <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> by tapping once for a fill, holding the pedal down for a transition, and double tapping for an outro.|$|R
5000|$|The tap is {{performed}} by an attacking player placing {{the ball on}} the ground, touching the ball <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> then picking it up and playing. NB: The ball must be released from the hands and come into contact with the ground or a change of possession occurs.|$|R
50|$|Like other corvids, black-billed magpies {{indulge in}} anting (applying ants onto their plumage) and sun-bathing (back facing the sun, head down, wings drooped and spread wide, tail fanned, back {{feathers}} fluffed up). They also belong to {{that group of}} birds that scratch <b>their</b> head <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> over the wing.|$|R
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} {{in western}} jackdaw flocks {{is determined by}} supplanting, fighting, and threat displays—several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E
5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E
25|$|Officials {{from the}} Guinness Book of World Records visited the {{athletics}} stadium at Yanbian University in July 2010 {{to witness a}} new world record being set: over one thousand students simultaneously juggled soccer balls <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> {{for more than ten}} seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{pattern in}} NC2S is the side-cross-side move. Typically, the lead starts this move by {{stepping}} side <b>with</b> <b>their</b> left <b>foot</b> and then crosses in front <b>with</b> <b>their</b> right <b>foot.</b> This {{is followed by}} another step to the side with the left foot. The rhythm, here, is quick, quick, slow. The follow does the same thing, but starts <b>with</b> <b>their</b> right <b>foot.</b> Both partners cross in front. In an interview with Phil Seyer [...] Buddy said he created this move by modifying something that was popular in the 60's called the [...] "Surfer Stomp." [...] The surfer stomp was simply, side, together, side, touch. In the DVIDA Nightclub Two-Step syllabus, this action is called a Traveling Cross.|$|R
50|$|Beevor’s Axiom is {{the idea}} that the brain does not know muscles, only movements. In other words, the brain {{registers}} the movements that muscles combine to make, not the individual muscles that are making the movements. Hence, this is why one can sign their name (albeit poorly) <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot.</b> Beevor’s Axiom was coined by Dr. Charles Edward Beevor, an English neurologist.|$|R
5000|$|Candle Push: One player must {{pull down}} awkwardly-placed {{stirrups}} <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> to release some obstacles {{while the other}} uses a thin metal rod to push the candle, on a brick through a course. The distance between the stirrup and the rod increases steadily, and because the team is restricted by the binding, the game becomes increasingly difficult as it progresses.|$|R
25|$|While audiences simply reacted <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> to his music, {{a kind of}} romanticism grew {{up around}} Graettinger that had {{protected}} him from the criticism of his peers. His total {{lack of interest in}} material possessions leading to very primitive living conditions, his method of writing music colors to illustrate the different instruments (much like Duke Ellington), and his total dedication to his music above all else, insured the admiration of other musicians.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks practiced {{an early}} form of pigeage when grapes {{were ready for}} crushing. Wicker baskets filled with grapes were placed inside wooden or {{earthenware}} vats with a rope or plank above. Vineyard workers grasped the rope for balance to crush the grapes <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> occasionally {{to the accompaniment of}} a flute played in a festive manner. After crushing, the grapes were placed in large pithoi, jars where fermentation took place.|$|E
25|$|When {{dining in}} a {{traditional}} tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as seiza. To sit in a seiza position, one kneels {{on the floor with}} legs folded under the thighs and the buttocks resting on the heels.|$|E

25|$|Racing horses <b>with</b> {{weakness}} in <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> or leg require specialized horseshoes.|$|R
50|$|Similar to a backflip kick, {{this attack}} sees the wrestler either start by lying down or drops {{down on the}} mat while the {{opponent}} standing near their head. The wrestler lifts a leg and kicks up over their waist and chest, hitting the opponent with the top of <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> usually in the head. Can {{be used as a}} counter to an attack from behind. For example, a wrestler attempts a full nelson, the wrestler breaks the opponent’s lock, falls to the canvas and kicks them in the face <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
25|$|While {{segments}} {{of the government of}} South Vietnam suffered severe problems in leadership, motivation and administration, it is clear that millions of ordinary South Vietnamese opposed insurgent and northern efforts to take over South Vietnam. These included some 900,000 refugees who voted <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> to move South when Vietnam was partitioned in 1954. Faced with a well-organized, ruthless foe, South Vietnamese (GVN- Government of South Vietnam) counter-strategy was heavily dependent on American aid and personnel. Coordination between the two allies was poor, and both seemed to fight separate wars for much of the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{impaired}} balance, patients {{suffering from}} ataxic cerebral palsy often walk <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> unusually far apart (a wide gait). In addition, the low muscle tone caused by ataxic cerebral palsy causes {{people suffering from}} the disease to appear very unsteady, as their body is constantly trying to counterbalance itself. Infants with the disease often take a significantly longer {{amount of time to}} be able to walk without support, and over 50% of all children with ataxic cerebral palsy experience some form of a learning disability or speech impediment.|$|E
25|$|Modern boxers can {{sometimes}} be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> {{in order to move}} effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg {{in the direction of the}} movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.|$|E
25|$|At {{the far end}} of the waggonway is the (fictional) {{coal mine}} Pockerley Gin Pit, which the waggonway notionally exists to serve. The pit head {{features}} a horse powered wooden whim gin, which was the method used before steam engines for hauling mean and material up and down mineshafts - coal was carried in corves (wicker baskets), while miners held onto the rope <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> in an attached loop.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} of {{conditions}} B and D, deltoid activity is higher, and from the experiment we are sure that they stand up <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> in order to avoid concentrating load towards the shoulder. Also, the posture of bending forward is usually an advantage in making the standing-up motion with buttocks getting up in advance. We observed this tendency from a comparison of conditions AB and CD.|$|R
5000|$|When the spat (larvae) {{leave the}} {{brooding}} chamber, {{they begin to}} develop an eye spot and a foot. They then migrate to hard surfaces (usually old oyster shells) where they attach by secreting a [...] "glue" [...] like substance from their byssus gland. Ostrea lurida spat swim <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> superior {{to the rest of}} their body. This swimming position causes the larvae to attach to the underside of horizontal surfaces.|$|R
25|$|While {{the exact}} origins of {{winemaking}} (and, thus, of pressing grapes) are not known, most archaeologists {{believe that it}} originated somewhere in the Transcaucasia between the Black and Caspian Seas in the land that now includes the modern countries of Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Iran. There are stories in the Imeretin Valley (in what is now Krasnodar Krai, Russia) dating to between 7000-5000 BC of early winemaking using hollowed out logs that they would fill with grapes, tread <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> and then scoop the juice and crushed grape remains into jars to ferment. In the 17th century, French traveller Sir Jean Chardin would describe a similar practice still in use thousands of years later in Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major feature}} is the Harecastle Tunnel, near Kidsgrove {{in the city of}} Stoke-on-Trent, north Staffordshire. There are {{actually}} two tunnels; the first was built by Brindley and was 2880 yards (2633 m) long, and boats were 'legged' through by men lying on their backs and pushing against the roof <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> This was a physically demanding and slow process and created major delays, so leading civil engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to provide a second, wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath. This 2926 yard (2676 m) long tunnel was opened in 1827. In the 1900s, the Brindley tunnel was closed due to severe subsidence, but the Telford Tunnel - although also prone to the same problems - remains in use, and is the fourth-longest navigable canal tunnel in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Blue jays {{have strong}} black bills which they use for {{cracking}} nuts, usually while holding them <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> and for eating corn, grains and seeds. Its food is sought {{both on the}} ground and in trees and includes virtually all known types of plant and animal sources, such as acorns and beech mast, weed seeds, grain, fruits and other berries, peanuts, bread, meat, small invertebrates of many types, scraps in town parks, bird-table food and rarely eggs and nestlings. Blue jays will sometimes cache food, though to what extent differs widely among individuals. Although seemingly contentious in their general behavior, Blue jays are frequently subservient to other medium-sized birds who visit bird-feeders. In Florida, Blue jays were dominated at feeders by Eastern gray squirrels, Florida scrub-jays, common grackles and red-headed woodpeckers, all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding.|$|E
50|$|The {{dance is}} a {{variation}} on a conga line. Participants dance in a line or a circle, {{holding on to the}} hips of the person in front of them. They tap the floor two times <b>with</b> <b>their</b> right <b>foot,</b> then <b>with</b> <b>their</b> left <b>foot,</b> then they hop forwards, backwards, and finally three hops forward to finish the sequence, which continues throughout the tune. The first person in the line or the open circle leads the group around the floor.|$|R
50|$|A {{penalty in}} rugby union {{is the main}} {{disciplinary}} sanction available to the referee to penalise a team who commit deliberate infringements. The team who did not commit the infringement are given possession of the ball and they may either kick it towards touch (in which case the ball back rule is waived), attempt a place kick at goal, or tap the ball <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> and run. It is also sometimes used as shorthand for penalty goal.|$|R
50|$|A Push sweep {{is one of}} {{the guard}} sweeps {{described}} in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Theory and Technique by Renzo and Royler Gracie. It is also demonstrated in The Essence Of Judo by one of Kyuzo Mifune's students, and it is an unnamed technique described in The Canon Of Judo. The main characteristic of the Push sweep is the practitioner pushing the opponent's knee out from under them <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>foot,</b> when the practitioner has the opponent in their open guard.|$|R
