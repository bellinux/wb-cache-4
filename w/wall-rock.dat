40|$|The Canan area (Honduras) is {{characterized}} by a gold-bearing ore deposit that is associated with quartz-veined shear zones. Gold mineralization occurs in low-to medium-grade metamorphic host-rocks (graphitic and sericitic schists). Hydrothermal fluids, which are associated with the emplacement of Cretaceous-Tertiary granodioritic intrusions, are responsible for the formation of quartz veins and the hydrothermal alteration of <b>wall-rocks.</b> Three main altered zones have been detected in the <b>wall-rocks</b> as far as 150 cm from the quartz veins. The distal zone (up to 50 -cm thick) contains quartz, chlorite and illite. The intermediate zone is the thickest (up to 80 cm) and is marked by quartz, muscovite, sulphides, kaolinite and native elements such as Au and Ag. The proximal zone, which is close to the quartz veins, is rather thin (up to 25 cm) and contains clay minerals, Al-oxides-hydroxides and sulphides. The transition from the distal to the proximal zone is accompanied by the enrichment of SiO 2 and the depletion of all other major elements, except for Fe 2 O 3 (tot). Precious metals occur in the highest concentrations in the intermediate zone (Au up to 7. 6 ppm and Ag up to 11 ppm). We suggest that gold was transported as a reduced sulphur complex and was precipitated from the hydrothermal solution by the reaction of the sulphur complexes with Fe 2 + from the alteration of the mafic minerals of the host-rock. Fluid-wall-rock interactions seem to be the main cause of gold mineralization. Genetic relationships with a strike-slip fault system, hydrothermal alteration zones within the metamorphic <b>wall-rocks,</b> and an entire set of geochemical anomalies are consistent with orogenic-type gold deposits of the epizonal class...|$|R
50|$|Intrusive related gold (Lang & Baker, 2001) is {{generally}} hosted in granites, porphyry, or rarely dikes. Intrusive related gold usually also contains copper, {{and is often}} associated with tin and tungsten, and rarely molybdenum, antimony, and uranium. Intrusive-related gold deposits rely on gold existing in the fluids associated with the magma (White, 2001), and the inevitable discharge of these hydrothermal fluids into the <b>wall-rocks</b> (Lowenstern, 2001). Skarn deposits are another manifestation of intrusive-related deposits.|$|R
50|$|However, today's {{mining and}} {{assaying}} allows the delineation of lower-grade bulk tonnage mineralisation, {{within which the}} gold is invisible to the naked eye. In these cases, veining is the subordinate host to mineralisation and may only be {{an indicator of the}} presence of metasomatism of the <b>wall-rocks</b> which contains the low-grade mineralisation. For this reason, veins within hydrothermal gold deposits are no longer the exclusive target of mining, and in some cases gold mineralisation is restricted entirely to the altered wall rocks within which entirely barren quartz veins are hosted.|$|R

5000|$|Pseudotachylite or Pseudotachylyte (original spelling) is a {{cohesive}} glassy or very fine-grained rock that occurs as veins and often contains inclusions of <b>wall-rock</b> fragments.

40|$|Abstract: The {{results of}} a {{detailed}} fluid inclusion study of a zone of auriferous quartz vein in the Clogau-St Davids goldmine, North Wales are presented. These show that both aqueous and an immiscible pair of H,O-CH, fluids were present during the mineralizing event. Compositions of the immiscible fluid pair are estimated from Laser Raman and bulk inclusion volatile analysis data. Thermometry and barometry using these fluid compositions shows that the ores were formed at c. 300 - 320 "C and c. 1. 8 kbar. A model is developed {{which is consistent with}} both the fluid inclusion data and other considera-tions. This involves the introduction of aqueous fluid into the graphitic shales hosting the mineralized veins which proceeds to react with graphite in the <b>wall-rocks</b> to produce H,O-CH, fluids. As H,O is consumed to produce CH,, an increase in salinity is observed in the residual aqueous inclusion fluids. Deposition of gold is ascribed to destabilization of either AuC 1; or Au(HS); complexes in the incoming fluid as a result of interaction with graphite. Auriferous zones within the veins are defined by high CH 4 values and low C 0,/CH 4 ratios in bulk inclusion analyses. These effects are thought {{to be the result of}} increased fluid-rock interaction in these zones, related to structural features in the <b>wall-rocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Cwm Llwyd Outlier of Namurian Middle Shales in {{the central}} part of the Black Mountain {{escarpment}} of SouthWales is an unusual structure. It occupies a topographic depression located more than 2 km from the main outcrop of the Middle Shales and has a stratigraphic discordance with its <b>wall-rocks</b> of more than 300 m. Previous interpretations advocating a karstic origin imply that this is the deepest known subsidence in Great Britain. However, although the outlier lies among some of the finest epikarst landforms in the country, several factors indicate that the subsidence was not caused by a karstic mechanism. These include the amount of stratigraphic displacement in contrast to the depth of available vertical space in the putative host Carboniferous Limestone, the relatively simple form of the outlier, and the absence of brecciation, marginal solution residues and associated palaeoendokarst features in the adjacent <b>wall-rocks.</b> The outlier is re-interpreted here as the product of faulting which occurred during a Variscan strike-slip or transpressive tectonic regime, producing local sinistral transtension that may have been re-activated in the Palaeogene period. Remapping the outlier at a scale of 1 : 2 500 indicates that the present structure is related principally to a left-stepping offset between the Cwm Llwyd and Llwyn Celyn faults. Analogies are drawn with the Cainozoic pull-apart structures in Southwest England. Near-surface reddening and kaolinization of the beds probably represent pre-Pleistocene weathering...|$|R

40|$|The geochemical {{characteristics}} of volcanic products {{in a variety}} of tectonic settings demonstrate that incorporation of crustal material into magmas is a relatively common process. Contamination of magmas by crustal components, in turn, can {{have a significant effect on}} magma composition and rheology. Despite this, the mechanism by which contamination occurs is still not well established and its efficacy is denied by some. In this study we focus on magma^ carbonate interaction and on the rock shells (cumulates and skarns) formed at the contact between a magma chamber and its <b>wall-rocks.</b> We deduce that previous, unsuccessful attempts at carbonate assimilation^fractional crystallization (AFC) modelling can be related to the paucity of information about the cumulate zone in contact with skarns. We use one of the best examples of a magmatic plumbing system emplaced within a thick carbonate substratum (the Colli AlbaniVolcanic District in Central Italy) to demonstrate that a âskarn environmentâcan act as a source of CaO-rich silicate melts, and that the assimilation of these melts into the primitive magma is the main process responsible for magma contamination, rather than the ingestion of solid carbonate <b>wall-rocks.</b> In particular, by means of microtextural observations, mineral chemistry, whole-rock geochemical data and MELTS simulations we highlight the effect of high Ca-Tschermaks (CaAl 2 SiO 6) activity in the melt on the stability of Cr-spinel, olivine, and clinopyroxene in cumulate rocks, define a reaction-cumulate zone where clinopyroxene crystallization is favoured, and model the magmatic differentiation processes active in this zone...|$|R

Anomalous, sub-economic gold-silver concentrations are associated with Stage 1 pyrite and Stage 2 pyrrhotite.

The process is analyzed by combining the physics of fragmentation and erosion to the concept of rock mass.

In reservoirs, mechanical processes play a subordinate role and thermal erosion processes prevail. In conduits, intermediate and silicic magmas may erode and, eventually, fragment good to poor quality country rock masses. Basalts may erode poor quality country rocks.

40|$|Abstract Zechstein (Z 1) rocksalt {{from the}} Fulda basin, from the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Hessen potash bed is folded into tight to isoclinal folds which are cut by an undeformed, 1 cm thick, coarse-grained halite vein. Microstructures were investigated in etched, gamma-irra-diated thin sections from both the wall rock and the vein. The lack of synsedimentary dissolution structures and the widespread occurrence of plate-shaped and hopper grains in the <b>wall-rock</b> suggests that the sedimentary environment was perennial lake. Deformation microstructures are in good agreement with solution-precipitation creep process, and salt flow under very low differential stress. Strength contrast between anhydrite-rich and anhydrite-poor layers caused the small scale folding in the halite beds. The vein is completely sealed and composed mainly of euhedral to subhedral halite grains, which often overgrow the <b>wall-rock</b> grains. Those microstructures, together {{with the presence of}} occasional fluid inclusion bands, suggest that the crystals grew into a solution-filled open space. Based on consider-ations on the maximum value of in-situ differential stress, the dilatancy criteria, the amount of released fluids from the potash bed during metamorphism and the volume change, it is proposed that the crack was generated by hydrofracturing of the rocksalt due to the presence of the salt-metamorphic fluid at near-lithostatic pressure...|$|E

The compositional trends of diamond microinclusions are consistent with those of diamond-forming media ranging continuously between a highly carbonatitic endmember and a highly silicic endmember. The microinclusions exhibit general enrichment of most incompatible elements, which is probably indicative of their crystallization during partial melting of mantle peridotites and eclogites. Our results also suggest that the diamond analyzed in this study may have formed as a result of interaction between carbonate-silicate melts and peridotitic <b>wall-rocks</b> at the base of a thick lithospheric mantle at depths below 300 km. The trace element distributions in the studied diamond microinclusions show a general similarity to those previously found in the parental kimberlites and carbonatites. These data suggest that diamonds may have crystallized either directly from a kimberlitic/carbonatitic melt or from a proto-kimberlitic fluid/melt, which was derived from a source also common to kimberlites. This is supported by differences in the major element compositions of diamond-forming fluids/melts and kimberlites. 4 page(s...|$|R
