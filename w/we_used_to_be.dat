25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E

40|$|We report our {{experiences}} with {{an association of}} local service providers as we under took mentoring, capability development and cultural transformation (mentoring for short) of their three senior staff in their project facilitation skills, {{on top of their}} existing very good policy, management and project management skills. The aim of our intervention <b>was</b> <b>to</b> extend the driving and the success of their business strategy. Most, if not all, of the separate component parts that <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> integrative in how we do our work in mentoring the three staff are well proven (not new). But we do claim that at least one way in which we combine the separate component parts, is in fact innovative. Specifically, the way we combine separate parts to make the link between inputs and outcomes achieved. The experiences reported <b>are</b> those relevant <b>to</b> the Systems Conference. Experiences related to other aspects of our work, are reported elsewhere...|$|R
30|$|These [non-western] {{students}} show {{a different}} behaviour compared <b>to</b> what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> They <b>are</b> less direct, do not dress correctly, do not turn in their homework {{on time and}} when confronted with the consequences, they try to negotiate.|$|R
500|$|While on tour, the xx acclimated {{themselves}} to the increased attention and became considerably more sociable and confident. As Sim recounted, [...] "If you'd have put me onstage at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire a few years ago, I'd have run away. I couldn't have done it. <b>We</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> terrified." [...] In June, the band played the Glastonbury Festival in Somerset and, according to journalist Jude Rogers, displayed a newfound confidence {{through the rest of}} their summer and [...] "post-Mercury [...] autumn" [...] concerts: [...] "Croft would sing more boldly, Sim developed an onstage swagger and Smith began experimenting with different rhythms and textures." ...|$|E

50|$|How <b>We</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Live <b>is</b> a British {{educational}} historical television drama {{written by}} Freda Kelsall and sometimes narrated by Redvers Kyle and John Crosse, both employed as continuity announcers at Yorkshire Television {{at the time}} of production. Production began in 1968 at the YTV studios in Leeds. The series traced the lives and fortunes of various fictional Yorkshire families from the Victorian era until the 1960s, in and around the fictional town of Bradley, using self-contained short dramas interspersed with archive footage.|$|R
30|$|Based {{on these}} reports {{we assume that}} the lavage method that <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> achieve {{hemostasis}} <b>is</b> not adequate for complete tumour cell lysis. The incubation time is short and numbers of lavages are relatively small. Nevertheless, free tumour cells in the pelvis might to some extent suffer from hypotonic distilled water lavage.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{solution}} {{of a pair}} of Coupled Partial Differential equations is derived. These equations arise in the {{solution of}} problems of flow of homogeneous liquids in fissured rocks and heat conduction involving two temperatures. These equations have been considered by Hill and Aifantis, but the technique <b>we</b> <b>use</b> appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> simpler and more direct, and some new results are derived. Also, discussion about the propagation of initial discontinuities is given and illustrated with graphs of some special cases...|$|R

2500|$|Nottopara, in the Ashoknagar Kalyangarh area of North 24 Parganas district, is a {{locality}} of dhakis, who came as refugees from East Bengal. The locality {{is named after}} them, and some thirty-five to forty families live there. They regret, [...] "earlier, <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated like any other artist. Today, we are just another component of the Puja paraphernalia, {{who are supposed to}} perform on those days." [...] Earlier, they used to be from around Mahalaya, but now go only for the five days. The importance of dhakis has diminished because of some people's preference for electronic music and bands. These days, some of the Nottos make dhaks. A dhak made of mango wood and goat skin sells for around Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500, leaving a profit of only Rs 50. Some have taken to other professions.|$|E

40|$|We present {{examples}} of characters of absolute Galois groups of number fields {{that can be}} recovered through their action by automorphisms on the profinite completion of the braid groups, using a ``rigidity'' approach. The way <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> recover them <b>is</b> through classical representations of the braid groups, and in particular through the Burau representation. This enables one to extend these characters to Grothendieck-Teichmueller groups...|$|R
