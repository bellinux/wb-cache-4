40|$|International audienceAn SUV- 150 B {{spectroradiometer}} {{for measuring}} solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiance was installed <b>at</b> <b>Summit,</b> Greenland, in August 2004. Here we compare the initial {{data from this}} new location with similar measurements from Barrow, Alaska and South Pole. Measurements of irradiance at 345 nm performed at equivalent solar zenith angles (SZAs) are almost identical <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> and South Pole. The good agreement can be explained with the similar location of the two sites on high-altitude ice caps with high surface albedo. Clouds have little impact at both sites, but can reduce irradiance at Barrow by more than 75 %. Clear-sky measurements at Barrow are smaller than <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> by 14 % in spring and 36 % in summer, mostly {{due to differences in}} surface albedo and altitude. Comparisons with model calculations indicate that aerosols can reduce clear-sky irradiance at 345 nm by 4 ? 6 %; aerosol influence is largest in April. Differences in total ozone at the three sites have a large influence on the UV Index. At South Pole, the UV Index is on average 20 ? 80 % larger during the ozone hole period than between January and March. <b>At</b> <b>Summit,</b> total ozone peaks in April and UV Indices in spring are on average 10 ? 25 % smaller than in the summer. Maximum UV Indices ever observed <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> and South Pole are 6. 7 and 4. 0, respectively. The larger value <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> is due to the site's lower latitude. For comparable SZAs, average UV Indices measured during October and November at South Pole are 1. 9 ? 2. 4 times larger than measurements during March and April <b>at</b> <b>Summit.</b> Average UV Indices <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> are over 50 % greater than at Barrow because of the larger cloud influence at Barrow...|$|R

40|$|Causes for {{the unusually}} high and {{seasonally}} anomalous ozone concentrations <b>at</b> <b>Summit,</b> Greenland were investigated. Surface data from continuous monitoring, ozone sonde data, tethered balloon vertical profiling data, correlation of ozone with the radionuclide tracers 7 Be and 210 Pb, and synoptic transport analysis {{were used to}} identify processes that contribute to sources and sinks of ozone <b>at</b> <b>Summit.</b> Northern Hemisphere (NH) lower free troposphere ozone mixing ratios in the polar regions are ∼ 20 ppbv higher than in Antarctica.

40|$|The {{activity}} of the natural radionuclide tracers 7 Be and 210 Pb has been determined in bulk aerosol samples collected over 2 -day intervals for nearly five full years <b>at</b> <b>Summit,</b> Greenland. Year-round sampling was conducted in three campaigns; summer 1997 to summer 1998, summer 2000 to summer 2002, and summer 2003 to present. As in previous summer campaigns <b>at</b> <b>Summit,</b> and a year-round investigation at Dye 3, variations {{in the activities of}} the tracers on short time scales were strongly correlated despite the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere source of 7 Be and the continental surface source of 222 Rn (precursor of 210 Pb). This behavior is attributed to boundary layer dynamics exerting the dominant control on activities in air just above the ice sheet. Aerosols and associated species are depleted from the boundary layer above the snow when a strong inversion limits exchange with the free troposphere. Episodic weakening of the inversion allows ventilation of the boundary layer. This cycle drives simultaneous decreases and increases in the radionuclide tracers. The correlation between 7 Be and 210 Pb on seasonal and annual bases was found to be stronger than at Dye 3, and the average {{activity of}} 7 Be was lower <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> despite the higher elevation (3. 0 versus 2. 5 km). These observations indicate that the boundary layer <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> is more effectively isolated than at Dye 3. The activity of 7 Be <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> peaked in June or July all 5 years, closely following the seasonality of stratospheric injection of 7 Be into the Arctic troposphere (based on seasonality of the 10 Be/ 7 Be ratio previously measured at Alert, NWT). This suggests that when the boundary layer <b>at</b> <b>Summit</b> is replenished by ventilation, it receives air reflecting the composition of the mid and upper troposphere...|$|R
