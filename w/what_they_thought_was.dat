5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a submarine.|$|E
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{joined the}} Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in {{response}} to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and Australia returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay mines at the Swarte Bank, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a British attack. Heavy fog {{and the need to}} refuel caused Australia and the British vessels to return to port on 17 August, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the Skagerrak while the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron swept the strait in an unsuccessful search of a possible minelayer.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E
5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving {{an estimate of the}} mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand was {{relieved}} by Australia as flagship of the 2nd BCS on 22 February 1915. The squadron joined the Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, {{in response to}} intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation.

25|$|The full {{version of}} Dead or Alive 5 {{was met with}} a {{generally}} positive critical response. Reviewers typically praised the game's graphics and animation, {{as well as the}} spectactularity of the fights and their deeper gameplay mechanics. However, several reviews criticized the story mode and aspects of its online features.

25|$|Carleton's {{men began}} {{preparing}} sangars on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> {{the summit of}} Tchrengula. In fact the mile-long summit was divided into two peaks, and in the dark, the British had occupied only the southern, lower summit. Vice Commandant Christiaan De Wet quickly grasped the situation, and led some men on horseback to gallop to {{the northern end of}} the hill, where they dismounted and climbed the hill to occupy the undefended northern summit. From there, the Boers pressed forward along the summit which was strewn with rocks which gave individual Boer riflemen ample cover. The British sangars were exposed and obvious targets to the Boers, and gave inadequate protection. Like the artillery, the British infantry relied on drill, firing volleys on the command of an officer. By the time the order had been given, the intended target was safe behind cover, while the British soldiers were exposed to fire.|$|E
25|$|Marvel Cave was {{originally}} called Marble Cave, after explorers in 1882 saw <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> marble on the cave's ceiling. This started the Marble Cave Mining Company, although {{later it was}} {{realized that there was}} never any marble in the cave. The Marble Cave Mining Company ceased all operations after only four and a half years. William Lynch purchased the cave in 1889, and soon after opened the cave to the public. In 1950, Hugo Herschend leased the cave for 99 years. The Herschends made renovations to the cave, and later opened a theme park, Silver Dollar City, on the surface above the cave. Marvel Cave is known for being one of the largest caves in Missouri, having one of the largest cave entry rooms (the Cathedral Room) of any cave in North America, and for being one of the longest running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.|$|E
25|$|The Roman force {{stationed}} at the pass, with no Fabius to restrain them, deserted their posts {{at the head of}} the pass to attack <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the main Carthaginian army trying to outflank their position and escape across the saddle. As soon as the Romans left their position, Hannibal's main army left camp, with the African infantry leading, the cavalry, the baggage train and the cattle herds marching in line after them, and Celts and Iberian infantry guarding the rear. The Carthaginian army moved through the pass unmolested, as Fabius did not challenge them. The Roman force attacking the saddle was bewildered when they confronted the lights on the saddle. The cattle ran amok, breaking their lines, the Carthaginian spearmen ambushed them, and a wild melee ensued. As dawn broke to make matters clear, a group of Iberian infantry was seen scaling the saddle walls to join the ongoing pandemonium on the saddle. The Iberians, being experts in mountain warfare, engaged the now scattered Roman soldiers and killed over 1,000 of their number, and managed to rescue the Carthaginian camp followers, the spearmen guard and some of the cattle well before the main Roman army could intervene.|$|E
50|$|The Allied ships {{proceeded}} north {{during the}} night of 11 November, and upon reaching a notional line between Bari and Durazzo by 01:00 without incident, they turned to run southward. Twenty minutes later, the raiders encountered six darkened enemy ships, including <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> two destroyers and four merchantmen. The enemy vessels passed across their front and were making for the Italian mainland. HMS Mohawk opened fire at 01:27, and action became general.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, SOM {{was awarded}} another major government-appointed project—creating a campus for the United States Air Force Academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado. SOM's {{concepts}} were not without detractors in Congress, in the Air Force leadership and elsewhere. As a senior SOM partner, Owings principal {{role in the}} project was to mediate differences between members of a Senate appropriations subcommittee and Air Force officers, {{some of whom had}} misgivings about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> the firm's unacceptably modern designs.|$|R
50|$|An intense {{interest}} in spiritualism, parapsychology and hypnosis continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{running in parallel}} with John Locke's views {{that there was an}} association of ideas requiring the coexistence of feelings with awareness of the feelings. Hypnosis, which was pioneered in the late 18th century by Franz Mesmer and Armand-Marie Jacques de Chastenet, Marques de Puységur, challenged Locke's association of ideas. Hypnotists reported <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> second personalities emerging during hypnosis and wondered how two minds could coexist.|$|R
