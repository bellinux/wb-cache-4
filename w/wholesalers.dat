Here, we assume that, {{as the first}} scenario, a return contract is concluded between the outside supplier and the supplier and also between the manufacturer and the <b>wholesaler.</b> In this chain, under the first scenario, the supplier receives the raw material and after inspecting them, send back the defective ones where those are purchased and the outside supplier purchase the defective raw material at a lower price. Then the supplier ships the healthy raw material to the manufacturer and the manufacturer transmutes them to the finished product to satisfy the <b>wholesaler’s</b> demand. In this stage of chain, the manufacturer employs a return policy to incentive the <b>wholesaler’s</b> orders where the manufacturer ships the products to the <b>wholesaler</b> and the <b>wholesaler</b> after receiving and inspecting items, returns the defective items to the manufacturer and fulfill the market demand with the health ones. Then the manufacturer purchases returned items at a lower price.

Besides, backordering shortage is permitted and demand is price-sensitive.|$|R

Since the 10th century, the early Song government began issuing their own receipts of deposit, yet this was restricted mainly to their monopolized salt industry and trade.

5|$|The Han {{economy was}} defined by {{significant}} population growth, increasing urbanization, unprecedented growth of industry and trade, and government experimentation with nationalization. In this era, the levels of minting and circulation of coin currency grew significantly, forming {{the foundation of a}} stable monetary system. The Silk Road facilitated the establishment of trade and tributary exchanges with foreign countries across Eurasia, many of which were previously unknown to the people of ancient China. The imperial capitals of both Western Han (Chang'an) and Eastern Han (Luoyang) were among the largest cities in the world at the time, in both population and area. Here, government workshops manufactured furnishings for the palaces of the emperor and produced goods for the common people.

5|$|Banknote: Paper {{currency}} {{was first}} developed in China. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), as merchants and <b>wholesalers</b> desired {{to avoid the}} heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. During the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the central government adopted this system for their monopolized salt industry, but a gradual reduction in copper production—due to closed mines and an enormous outflow of Song-minted copper currency into the Japanese, Southeast Asian, Western Xia and Liao Dynasty economies—encouraged the Song government in the early 12th century to issue government-printed paper currency alongside copper to ease the demand on their state mints and debase the value of copper. In the early 11th century, the Song Dynasty government authorised sixteen private banks to issue notes of exchange in Sichuan, but in 1023 the government commandeered this enterprise and set up an agency to supervise the manufacture of banknotes there. The earliest paper currency was limited to certain regions {{and could not be}} used outside specified bounds, but once paper was securely backed by gold and silver stores, the Song Dynasty government initiated a nationwide paper currency, between 1265 and 1274. The concurrent Jin Dynasty (1115–1234) also printed paper banknotes by at least 1214.|$|E

In Poland, the cochineal trade was mostly monopolized by Jewish merchants, who bought the dye from peasants in Red Ruthenia and other regions of Poland and Lithuania. The merchants shipped the dye to major Polish cities such as Kraków, Gdańsk (Danzig), and Poznań. From there, the merchandise was exported to <b>wholesalers</b> in Breslau (Wrocław), Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Venice, and other destinations. The Polish cochineal trade was a lucrative business for the intermediaries; according to Marcin of Urzędów (1595), one pound of Polish cochineal cost between four and five Venetian pounds. In terms of quantities, the trade reached its peak in the 1530s. In 1534, 1963 stones (about 30 metric tons) of the dye were sold in Poznań alone.|$|E
