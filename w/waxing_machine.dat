Based on the {{existing}} LED (light emitting diode) chip <b>waxing</b> <b>machine</b> running in single-station serial mode, a multi-station LED chip <b>waxing</b> <b>machine</b> was designed which made creative improvements on the revolving platform of the <b>waxing</b> <b>machine.</b> Working efficiency was greatly increased with multi-station continuous parallel working mode. The control system used genetic algorithm-based PID (proportion integration differentiation) control to precisely control the revolving platform and all the manipulators, so that the <b>waxing</b> <b>machine</b> would carry out the fully automated assembly line work...|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} Pine weevil (Hylobius abietis) {{has been one}} of the most common pests for young conifer {{seedlings}} in the northern part of Europe. Chemical protection was commonly used to protect conifer seedlings. Nowadays, certification systems such as FSC and PEFC are wide spread and include rules to reduce the use of chemicals. In the near future, a ban on using insecticides in forestry will be a reality and development of other kinds of Pine weevil protection will be necessary. Mechanical protection is one possible solution to reduce the damage caused by the Pine weevil. ÅSSI Plantskydd AB has invented a new method for application of mechanical Pine weevil protection. A study of the <b>wax</b> <b>machine</b> was performed to compare the competitiveness to other systems used for treating conifer seedlings with Pine weevil protection. The conclusions of the study are that the working environment is relatively good at the <b>wax</b> <b>machine</b> and it is possible to increase capacity in the future. The <b>wax</b> <b>machine</b> is also more profitable than manual systems at a production capacity of 2 250 000 treated seedlings per season for the first active year after the investment is done. For the following years the <b>wax</b> <b>machine</b> is more profitable than manual methods already at a production capacity of 500 000 treated seedlings per season...|$|R

50|$|Ruttmann was a {{prominent}} exponent of both avant-garde art and music. His early abstractions played at the 1929 Baden-Baden Festival to international acclaim despite their being almost eight years old. Ruttmann licensed a <b>Wax</b> Slicing <b>machine</b> from Oskar Fischinger to create special effects for Lotte Reiniger. Together with Erwin Piscator, {{he worked on the}} film Melody of the World (1929), though he is best remembered for Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt (Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, 1927).|$|R

5000|$|In Frankfurt, Fischinger met {{the theatre}} critic Bernhard Diebold, who in 1921 {{introduced}} Fischinger {{to the work}} and personage of Walter Ruttmann, a pioneer in abstract film. Inspired by Ruttmann's work, Fischinger began experimenting with colored liquids and three-dimensional modelling materials such as wax and clay. He invented a [...] "Wax Slicing Machine", which synchronized a vertical slicer with a movie camera's shutter, enabling the efficient imaging of progressive cross-sections through a length of molded wax and clay. Fischinger wrote to Ruttmann about his machine, who expressed interest. Moving to Munich, Fischinger licensed the <b>wax</b> slicing <b>machine</b> to Ruttmann, who used it to make some backgrounds for Lotte Reiniger's Prince Achmed film. During this time Fischinger shot many abstract tests of his own using the machine. Some of these are distributed today under the assigned title Wax Experiments.|$|R

In the original format, a cashier {{sat in a}} change booth {{in the center of}} the restaurant, behind a wide marble counter with five to eight rounded depressions. The diner would insert the required number of coins in a machine and then lift a window, hinged at the top, and remove the meal, usually wrapped in <b>waxed</b> paper. The <b>machines</b> were replenished from the kitchen behind. All or most New York automats had a cafeteria-style steam table where patrons could slide a tray along rails and choose foods, which were ladled from tureens.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a graphene oxide printing technology using wax printed membranes for the fast patterning and water activation transfer using pressure based mechanisms. The wax printed membranes have 50 μm resolution, longtime stability and infinite shaping capability. The {{use of these}} membranes complemented with the vacuum filtration of graphene oxide provides the control over the thickness. Our demonstration provides a solvent free methodology for printing graphene oxide devices {{in all shapes and}} all substrates using the roll-toroll automatized mechanism present in the <b>wax</b> printing <b>machine.</b> Graphene oxide was transferred over a wide variety of substrates as textile or PET in between others. Finally, we developed a touch switch sensing device integrated in a LED electronic circuit. This work was supported by The European Commission Program, FP 7 -OCEAN, SMS Project (613844).

40|$|The {{frequencies}} of normal modes of free vibration of three cylinders of different thickness were found experimentally. For {{some of the}} modes damping was also found. The modes excited were of a single axial half wave and multiple circumferential waves. The shells were geometrically similar except for thickness and were made by electroplating copper on accurately <b>machined</b> <b>wax</b> mandrels. Melting the wax produced shells of very uniform thickness without seams. The modes and frequencies agreed to within 10 % of the theoretical values for cylinders with fixed ends, except at small numbers of waves where they agreed more closely with the theoretical values for freely supported ends. The damping factors tended toward a small constant value with increasing numbers of waves above the mode with fundamental frequency, but increased rapidly as the numbers of waves decreased below the fundamental...|$|R
40|$|Parallel Kinematic Machines (PKMs) {{have many}} {{advantages}} {{and have been}} widely used in the machine industry. Benefitting from its modular structure, a PKM is more reconfigurable than traditional serial machines. In this paper, a new type of driving strut module and innovative joints are designed for the Reconfigurable Parallel Kinematic Machine (RPKM). The new driving strut module can be changed from linear drive mode to telescopic drive mode easily, and the new spherical joint and universal joint are designed to achieve a large rotation angle. The inverse kinematics problems in relation to the 6 ‐ DOF RPKM are analysed, and the Workspace Volume Index (WVI) and the Global ConditionIndex (GCI) are adopted to design the RPKM. According to the WVI and GCI analysis of the selected parameters for two types of 6 ‐ DOF PKM, the dimensional parameters of the RPKM are designed. In the end, the new type of RPKM prototype is built, with which a <b>wax</b> pattern is <b>machined...</b>|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to force-feedback, vibrotactile feedback provides tactile information, with minimal cost and complexity. A prototype vibrotactile sensor and display was developed for a deep-sea manipulator. Vibrations were sensed with four strips of piezo-electric film embedded in a hard silicone rubber layer just beneath the jaw surface. An integrated vibration display was mounted onto {{the end of a}} modified master controller. The vibration display played the vibrations sensed at the jaw surface back to the human operator through two methods. The first shook a mass within the display providing a high frequency response. The second directly excited the fingertip pads through two paddles providing low frequency response. The system was tested underwater at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) both at sea while operators performed normal benthic tasks and in a test tank located onshore. For the tank, operators correctly identified the relative hardness of three blocks made of different materials [...] wood, aluminum and <b>machine</b> <b>wax.</b> For the first time MBARI operators were able to tactilely sense their deep-sea environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to offer a unique procedure of integrated Reverse Engineering (RE) and Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies through implementation of a comprehensive experimental study to present an extensive comparison between applicable rapid technologies for blade rapid investment casting. Different direct and indirect AM techniques were used to produce sacrificial investment casting patterns. In addition, an aluminium mould of a blade for wax injection was fabricated using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining to compare conventional investment casting with the proposed rapid investment casting process. Dimensional inspection of cast blades showed that the MultiJet Modelling (MJM) method has the most economic justification and compatibility with blade rapid investment casting {{and it can be}} considered as an alternative to conventional <b>wax</b> precision CNC <b>machining.</b> On the other hand, sacrificial patterns produced by the Perfactory system showed lower applicability for investment casting due to pattern flexibility and difficulties in burn-out step. As for examined rapid tooling technologies, silicone rubber moulding was not a stable technique for small batch fabrication of blade wax patterns. In contrast, the results proved that epoxy resin tooling could make possible new cost-effective approaches for low volume production of gas turbine blades...|$|R
40|$|In layer-based rapid prototyping, a {{volumetric}} {{object is}} approximated as {{a pile of}} slices with vertical walls. Process parameter selection in layer-based prototyping is a multicriteria multiparameter optimization problem. A number of criteria {{may be used for}} assessing the prototype's quality. Volumetric accuracy of shape approximation and building time are just two criteria taken in this work as an example. Criteria depend on process parameters, most commonly in a mutually contradictory manner. Model orientation and slice thickness constitute the minimum of process parameters to be considered, but others may also be added. For this reason, a neural network is used, trained by a number of input-output vectors, when analytical formulae representing the dependency of criteria on process parameters are not possible to develop and/or available numerical models take too long to execute. Neural network meta-models are used in the evaluation (cost) function of a genetic algorithm, each representing a particular criterion, and criteria are weighted according to the user's particular view. A case study is presented, referring to a <b>wax</b> model prototyping <b>machine</b> in which a particular tree for investment casting is built. A new criterion for assessing the quality of shape approximation is introduced, namely the local volumetric error per slice. © IMechE 2007...|$|R
