Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef. In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she [...] "thought that he definitely had the quality that Yusef would need—which is a very ambiguous but charming quality!" [...] Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming. He explained: [...] "They're so welcoming. There's a lot of joking about.

Daniel Ricciardo issued apologies to the Australian fans after what he felt was a [...] "boring" [...] race. Red Bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer Renault and lamented the dominance of their rivals, calling for the FIA {{to step in and}} apply rule changes to level the field, fearing that the public would lose interest in the sport if nothing happened. Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get your fucking head down and work to sort it out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good fight. That would be awesome." [...] This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel, who replied: [...] "Be honest. Do you really hope so? Seriously?

500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out.

At this time, Nixon sent his adviser, former Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, on a fact finding trip to Europe to gather intelligence on Western alliance and Soviet issues. In response to Humphrey's calls for a face to face debate, Nixon remarked: [...] "Before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> debate between Nixon and Humphrey, Humphrey's got to settle his debate with himself." [...] Nixon campaigned in San Francisco, in front of 10,000 supporters amidst an array of protests. The candidate took on the protesters first hand, and delivered his [...] "forgotten American" [...] speech, declaring that election day would be [...] "a day of protest for the forgotten American," [...] a group which included those that [...] "obey the law, pay their taxes, go to church, send their children to school, love their country and demand new leadership." [...] By month's end, many in the Nixon campaign believed his election was guaranteed, beginning to prepare for the transition period, despite Nixon's warning that [...] "the one thing that can beat us now is overconfidence."

He thought he might have found something that could make a big difference to the lives of many who still suffered. Bill is quoted as saying: [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD [...] <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going — well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos.|$|E

The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists.

2500|$|Early {{studies of}} alcoholics who {{underwent}} LSD treatment reported a 50% success rate after a single high-dose session. However, {{the studies that}} reported high success rates had insufficient controls, lacked objective measures of genuine change, and failed to conduct rigorous follow-up interviews with subjects. The lack of conclusive evidence notwithstanding, individual case reports are often dramatic. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous conducted medically supervised experiments in the 1950s {{on the effects of}} LSD on alcoholism. Bill is quoted as saying [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going—well, that might be of some help.

[...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos. In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: [...] "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much.
