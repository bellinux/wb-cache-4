Victoria Beckham sings on the single version, while Halliwell sings on the album version, after Halliwell confessed that she had a hard time singing on that particular key. The single version appears in the music video, and on stage the girls always performed the single version before and after Halliwell's departure.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, {{the period}} of {{economic}} prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short-lived. [...] As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: [...] "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> ruin... It is the devil's excrement." [...] This was the case during the [...] "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{proclamation}} {{issued in}} Bergamo on August 3, 1848, the revolutionary leader Garibaldi {{referred to the}} historic Battle of Legnano {{as a source of}} inspiration for his own struggle for the unification of Italy: [...] "Bergamo will be the Pontida of the present generation, and God <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> a Legnano!". [...] In a similar vein Il Canto degli Italiani, written in 1847 and now the Italian national anthem, contains the lines, [...] "From the Alps to Sicily, Legnano is everywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|The status {{referendum}} {{has been}} criticized by some members of all political parties, including the New Progressive Party (PNP) that proposed it. Former Governor of Puerto Rico Pedro Rosselló (from the PNP) said that the choices in the ballot were confusing and might cause [...] "an uncertainty that, in the end, <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> more of the same: the status quo, continued." [...] Another former governor from the PNP, Carlos Romero Barceló, argued that [...] "the content and language of the formulas will confuse the voter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Major Indoor Soccer League [...] {{was the top}} {{professional}} indoor soccer {{league in}} the United States. The league {{was a member of}} both the United States Soccer Federation and FIFA. The MISL had replaced the NPSL which folded in 2001. According to MISL.net, the league ceased operations as of May 31, 2008. [...] "We are considering structural changes that <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> greater efficiencies, while also allowing long term growth and expansion of the League", said John Hantz, former Chairman of the MISL, and Owner/Operator of the Detroit Ignition. All the teams from MISL went to the new indoor leagues: NISL, PASL and [...] the XSL. [...] The NISL and XSL used the same playing rules as the MISL.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} notable {{for having a}} stance of sexual purity (abstinence), modesty and refusing to date. On June 3, 2003, BarlowGirl was quoted as saying, [...] "We believe that God has one perfect man already chosen for us; {{therefore}} we have {{no need to worry}} ourselves in searching for him. When the time is right, we know God <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> together. In the mean time, we are not hiding in a closet avoiding all males, we are still living our lives, just without the pressure of having to have a boyfriend." [...] In their 2004 song [...] "Average Girl", the three sisters likened themselves to Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, falling into a deep sleep and resting in God until He sends a prince their way. In 2006 and again in 2016, Lauren Barlow identified herself with another Disney Princess instead, Ariel from The Little Mermaid.|$|E
2500|$|The queer theorist Robert McRuer {{compared}} The Sexual Brain to {{the political}} scientist Charles Murray and the psychologist Richard Herrnstein's The Bell Curve (1994), arguing that just as Murray and Herrnstein presented inequality as inevitable rather than the consequence of economic institutions that could be changed, LeVay failed to question the institution of heterosexuality. The biologist Steven Rose criticized the publicity that surrounded the publication of LeVay's book, arguing that LeVay over-stated the importance of his findings, behavior which Rose considered {{similar to that of}} Dean Hamer and other researchers. Bruce Thornton questioned the value of LeVay's work, writing that while LeVay asserted that the future would bring progress in understanding the development of sexuality, this begs [...] "the question of just how much good this knowledge <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> when we are storm-tossed on the sea of eros." [...] The psychiatrist and medical historian Vernon Rosario criticized LeVay for his biological determinism and reductionism. The philosopher Edward Stein, writing in The Mismeasure of Desire (1999), criticized LeVay for failing to discuss social constructionism despite its relevance to his topic. The anthropologist Melvin Konner wrote that LeVay's book is an [...] "excellent brief introduction to the biology of gender" [...] and [...] "makes a graceful, excellent starting point" [...] for understanding the neuroscience of sexual arousal and associated behaviors. Louis A. Berman wrote that LeVay erroneously minimizes the role of experience in becoming an effective male partner in heterosexual intercourse.|$|E

We went back to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye ... I approach these problems not from a moral point of view, but, hard as it may sound, from a cost-benefit point of view. If I'm very hard-headed, I can say, what is the political benefit in killing this person? <b>Will</b> it <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> nearer to peace? <b>Will</b> it <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> nearer to an understanding with the Palestinians or not? In most cases I don't think it will. But in the case of Black September we had no other choice and it worked. Is it morally acceptable? One can debate that question. Is it politically vital?

Scientists have only found HCV-like viruses in horses, rodents, and bats, without any of them actually being HCV as it appears in humans. The closest related virus is one resembling HCV in horses, while the viruses in rodents and bats are more distant relatives. Sequencing the genome of the HCV-like virus in horses will enable researchers to compare the HCV-like virus in horses with HCV in humans and other animals and this will help the scientists discover more {{about the relationship between}} the different viruses. An effective vaccine for horses will most probably lead to a vaccine for humans. Scientists can study the immune system's response to the virus in horses and study if vaccine candidates have any effect.|$|R
