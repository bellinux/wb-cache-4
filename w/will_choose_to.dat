25|$|Despite {{possibilities}} of matricide and ovary activations, workers produce very few males. Worker policing over eggs is also seen where workers <b>will</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> keep queen-laid eggs and remove worker-laid eggs.

Furthermore, even though very few workers have active ovaries, the majority of workers did not.|$|E

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} developed {{arguments for}} the existence of God, while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience may seem to imply that God knows how free agents <b>will</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> act. If God does know this, their ostensible free will might be illusory, or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does not know it, God may not be omniscient.|$|E

If a team is proceeding slowly, some captains <b>will</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skillful bowler to avoid penalties that {{are perceived to be}} greater, such as being banned or losing points.|$|E

25|$|After fermentation, the oak barrel aging {{regiment}} {{will vary}} with {{the length of time}} and proportion of new oak barrels that are used. Most Cote de Nuit producers prefer to age their red wines {{for at least a year}} to 18 months and blend lots between barrels of different ages. The traditional barrel used in Burgundy holds 228 liters which is slightly larger than the 225 liters that a traditional Bordeaux wine barrel holds. Prior to bottling, the producer will decide on what, if any fining and filtration methods will be used in the clarification and stabilization of the wine. Some producers will use both, others will fine and not filter and a few <b>will</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> use neither, believing that they can reduce the complexity of the wine even though the wine may have a higher risk of spoilage and instability.|$|E
25|$|A poll tax, {{also called}} {{a per capita}} tax, or {{capitation}} tax, is a tax that levies a set amount per individual. It {{is an example of}} the concept of fixed tax. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the Bible of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11â€“16) was a form of poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes therefore do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples <b>will</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed. The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 Peasants' Revolt. Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the Community Charge, but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the 'Poll Tax Riots'.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States and Canada {{one must}} first {{complete}} a Bachelor's degree. Students may typically decide any major subject of their choice, however they must enroll in specific courses, usually outlined in a pre-medical program. One must then apply to and attend 4 years {{of medical school}} in order to earn his MD or DO and to complete his medical education. Psychiatrists must then pass three successive rigorous national board exams (United States Medical Licensing Exams [...] "USMLE", Steps 1, 2, and 3), which draws questions from all fields of medicine and surgery, before gaining an unrestricted license to practice medicine. Following this, the individual must complete a four-year residency in Psychiatry as a psychiatric resident and sit for annual national in-service exams. Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine (pediatrics may be substituted for {{some or all of}} the internal medicine months for those planning to specialize in child and adolescent psychiatry) and two months of neurology, usually during the first year, but some programs require more. Occasionally, some prospective psychiatry residents <b>will</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> do a transitional year internship in medicine or general surgery, in which case they may complete the two months of neurology later in their residency. After completing their training, psychiatrists take written and then oral specialty board examinations. [...] The total amount of time required to qualify in the field of psychiatry in the United States is typically 4 to 5 years after obtaining the MD or DO (or in total 8 to 9 years minimum). Many psychiatrists pursue an additional 1â€“2 years in subspecialty fellowships on top of this such as child psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, and psychosomatic medicine.|$|E
