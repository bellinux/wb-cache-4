25|$|Bob Summers, my brother-in-law, {{has come}} into his own over the years too. Bob and I worked a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s. He also was chief {{arranger}} for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded some of my material, great too! Also Bob and I worked at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford's home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer <b>with</b> <b>us),</b> <b>a</b> piano man whom I played with a few times; a real swinger too.|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>A</b> {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ah, {{how often}} {{in those days}} have we yearned for the sympathy of a stage peasantry, who would have crowded round us, eager not to miss one word of the thrilling narrative, who would have rejoiced <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{encouraging}} laugh, and have condoled <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grieved [...] "Oh," [...] and who would have gone off, when we {{had had enough of}} them, singing about it.|$|R
2500|$|Albarn {{revealed}} that originally, many people whom he knew were {{against the war}} were reluctant to take a stand, stating [...] "to {{be honest with you}} when Robert Del Naja and myself started really stepping up prior to the war {{it was very difficult to}} find anyone. And I don't want to name any names because they are people who I respect but they were really, for some reason, very reticent to stand <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>A</b> lot of people who you would now associate with being anti-war at that particular point didn't seem to be prepared to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|William went on {{to condemn}} James's {{advisers}} for overturning the religion, laws, and liberties of England, Scotland, and Ireland {{by the use of}} the suspending and dispensing power; the establishment of the [...] "manifestly illegal" [...] commission for ecclesiastical causes and its use to suspend the Bishop of London and to remove the Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford. William also condemned James's attempt to repeal the Test Acts and the penal laws through pressuring individuals and waging an assault on parliamentary boroughs, as well as his purging of the judiciary. James's attempt to pack Parliament was in danger of removing [...] "the last and great remedy for all those evils". [...] "Therefore", William continued, [...] "we have thought fit to go over to England, and to carry over <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> force sufficient, by the blessing of God, to defend us from the violence of those evil Counsellors... this our Expedition is intended for no other design, but to have, a free and lawful Parliament assembled as soon as is possible".|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{employed}} [...] {{to deduce}} {{that the term}} , yamim, (literally [...] "days") sometimes means [...] "a year," [...] and Rab Hisda thus interpreted the word , yamim, in [...] to mean [...] "a year." [...] says, [...] "And her brother and her mother said: ‘Let the maiden abide with us , yamim, at the least ten." [...] The Gemara reasoned that if , yamim, in [...] means [...] "days" [...] and thus to imply [...] "two days" [...] (as the plural implies more than one), then [...] would report Rebekah's brother and mother suggesting that she stay first two days, and then when Eliezer said that that was too long, nonsensically suggesting ten days. The Gemara thus deduced that , yamim, must mean [...] "a year" [...] in [...] as [...] implies when it says, [...] "if a man sells {{a house in a}} walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year ( [...] , yamim) shall he have the right of redemption." [...] Thus [...] might mean, [...] "Let the maiden abide <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> year, or at the least ten months." [...] The Gemara then suggested that , yamim, might mean [...] "a month," [...] as [...] suggests when it uses the phrase [...] "a month of days ( [...] , yamim)." [...] The Gemara concluded, however, that , yamim, means [...] "a month" [...] only when the term [...] "month" [...] is specifically mentioned, but otherwise means either [...] "days" [...] (at least two) or [...] "a year." ...|$|E
