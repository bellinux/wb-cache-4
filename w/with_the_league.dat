5|$|Miami and Virginia Tech began {{official}} ACC {{play with}} the 2004 college football season. After the league settled a lawsuit resulting from {{the departure of the}} three former Big East Conference teams, Boston College began ACC play in the 2005 season. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> officially at 12 teams, it became eligible to hold a conference championship football game.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, it was {{announced}} that Ramirez had formally filed papers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> to be reinstated to baseball and that an agreement had been reached between MLB and the Players Association that Ramirez would need only to serve a 50-game suspension instead of the original 100.|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} in Pittsburgh, Stuart {{moved to the}} Portage Lakes Hockey Club, a team in {{northern}} Michigan, for the 1903–1904 season and played in fourteen exhibition games, finishing fourth on the team with thirteen goals scored. With {{the formation of the}} International Professional Hockey League, Stuart left Portage Lake for the Calumet Miners, where he accepted the positions of coach and manager, in addition to playing cover-point, for $1,800. He scored eighteen goals for Calumet in 1904–1905, helped the team <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> championship and was named to the end of season all-star team as the best cover-point in the league.|$|E

5|$|An upstart {{baseball}} league {{was created}} in 1884 by Henry Lucas called the Union Association(UA). Several member of the Blues' signed contracts with teams in the UA despite being subject to the reserve clause: including star players McCormick, Dunlap, and Jack Glasscock. These moves caused the Blues to become financially unstable. However, the franchise was able to secure a deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> for a better share of gate receipts. This deal was not enough for the franchise to profit, and Bulkeley sold the team to Lucas for $2,500 ($ current dollar adjustment) following {{the conclusion of the}} 1884season.|$|E
5|$|As the League developed, {{its role}} expanded, {{and by the}} middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of {{international}} activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>League.</b> During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E

5|$|City's season {{opened with}} a 0–0 draw at home to Liverpool. City were awarded a penalty, but new captain Tony Book hit it wide. Two defeats followed, at Southampton and Stoke. The Stoke defeat led to a {{tactical}} switch. Mike Summerbee, who played wide on the right {{at the start of}} the season, was moved to centre-forward. The change reaped immediate dividends, with Summerbee playing a leading role in a 4–2 win against Southampton. This was the first in a run of five straight wins, after which Manchester City had caught up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> leaders. During this run of wins young winger Stan Bowles made his league debut, scoring twice in a 5–2 win against Sheffield United.|$|E
5|$|Corporate {{support for}} the Heritage Classic {{exceeded}} expectations; Chief Operating Officer John Collins announced that the league had gained more sponsorship revenue for Calgary's game than it had the Winter Classic. While the league would not commit to holding a third Heritage Classic, Collins admitted that nearly every team had expressed interest in holding their own game and that title sponsor Tim Hortons had signed a multi-year deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league.</b>|$|E
5|$|FOXSports.com's Jay Glazer {{reported}} on July 16, 2008, that the Packers filed tampering {{charges against the}} Minnesota Vikings <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> office, alleging improper communication between Vikings offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and Favre, although one source suggested that Favre {{may have been in}} contact with Vikings head coach Brad Childress. After an investigation, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ruled there had been no violation of tampering rules.|$|E

5|$|In 1989 the Walled Meadow {{was sold}} for {{redevelopment}} {{and the club}} moved to the brand new Portway Stadium, which {{is located on the}} West Portway Industrial Estate. A crowd of 1,100 watched the official opening match against Leicester City, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> team coming away with a 10–1 victory. After much deliberation over the cost and distance of travel involved in Southern League football, the club voluntarily stepped down the pyramid ladder to join the Wessex League in 1993–94.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 2011–12 season, Salo {{suffered}} a minor groin injury that sidelined him on two separate occasions, costing him three games and one game, respectively. In January 2012, the Canucks and Bruins played against each other for the first time since the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. During the contest, Salo sustained a concussion after a clipping hit from opposing forward Brad Marchand. Salo left the game immediately, while Marchand received a five-minute major and game misconduct; he was later additionally suspended for five games following a hearing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scheduling {{was left}} up to each team. There were wide variations, both in {{the overall number of}} games played and in the number played against other Association members. Thus, no {{official}} standings were maintained. In addition, football teams in the APFA also faced independent football teams not associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league.</b> For instance, the Rochester Jeffersons played a schedule consisting mostly of local teams from their local sandlot circuit and the NYPFL, not the APFA.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} {{complement of}} a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines, {{and this was}} probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes {{seem to have been}} easily destabilised by extra weight. There were therefore probably around 5,000 hoplite marines <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> fleet.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} the {{question}} of relations between the U.S. and the League. Hughes' State Department initially ignored communications from the League, or tried to bypass it through direct communications with member nations. By 1922, though, the U.S., through its consul in Geneva, was dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>League,</b> and though the U.S. refused to participate in any meeting with political implications, it sent observers to sessions on technical and humanitarian matters.|$|E
5|$|When Philip of Hesse {{formed the}} Schmalkaldic League {{at the end}} of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined {{on the basis of a}} Lutheran {{interpretation}} of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Zurich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> were severed. The Burgrecht cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.|$|E

5|$|When the Columbian Baseball League was {{forming in}} 1912, The New York Times named Shay {{as one of}} two {{candidates}} to manage the league's Kansas City team. The {{president of the new}} league, John T. Powers, said that the league would not serve as a third major league, but he noted that many players were eager to sign <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> after their contracts had expired in 1911. The league never materialized. One of its main investors, brewer Otto Stifel, withdrew his support of the league before play began.|$|E
5|$|With the pre-War team dispersed, {{the club}} {{struggled}} to reassert its {{dominance in the}} late 1940s and eventually suffered relegation to the Second Division under Cliff Britton in the 195051 season. After finishing second in the 195354 season, the club returned to the top tier of English football, {{the level at which}} they have played ever since. In 1961, the club appointed Harry Catterick as manager who led the club to the league title again in both the 196263 and 196970 seasons, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> successes punctuated by another FA Cup triumph, this time a 32 victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley.|$|E
5|$|Amos {{was born}} in Macclesfield, Cheshire {{and was a member}} of the Crewe Alexandra academy until he was {{released}} at the age of 10. While at Crewe, he also played for another local team, Bollington United, as a centre midfielder. One year later, Amos was playing for his local team against the team at the top of the table, and they needed to win the match to win the league. Amos' team's goalkeeper was injured during the game, and as the tallest on the team, Amos was put in goal; however, he had also been the team's regular penalty taker all season, so when they were awarded a penalty, he went all the way up the pitch to take the kick. He scored, and his team went on to win the game 3–2, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> title. After the game, his parents told him that a Manchester United scout had been watching him and that he had been invited for trials. Amos joined Manchester United at the age of 11.|$|E
