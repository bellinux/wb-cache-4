5|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the Northwest Territory, then the Illinois Territory, then the Michigan Territory, and finally the Wisconsin Territory.

5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E

5|$|Mastodon {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to be stored at Tengah <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> available, so each Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E
5|$|The young {{air force}} was a small, close-knit {{organisation}} comparable to a flying club, although several pioneering flights were undertaken by its members. One {{of the most}} notable was made by Goble and Flying Officer (later Flight Lieutenant) Ivor McIntyre in 1924, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> the first men to circumnavigate Australia by air, in a single-engined Fairey IIID floatplane. The English-born McIntyre, who was lead pilot while Goble acted as commander and navigator, was also a World War I veteran of the Royal Naval Air Service. The purpose of the flight was to survey the northern coastline of Australia for defence planning, and to test {{the capabilities of the}} Fairey IIID.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the Northwest Territory, formed in 1787.

After Illinois' statehood the area was incorporated into the Michigan Territory in 1818 and later became part of the Wisconsin Territory in 1836.

5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> aware that its cover was blown.|$|E
5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E

5|$|Graysmith {{first met}} Fischer and Vanderbilt at {{the premiere of}} Paul Schrader's film, Auto Focus, {{which was based on}} Graysmith's 1991 book about {{the life and death of}} actor Bob Crane. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based on his work on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project and moved on to Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Arsenal {{were the}} {{dominant}} side of England, winning five league championships and two FA Cups. Their fortunes waned, but the club soon enjoyed infrequent periods of success, including Inter-Cities Fairs Cup triumph and a first league and cup {{double in the}} 1970s. During the late 1980s, Arsenal had built a side that threatened Liverpool's league dominance, and performed greatly in cup competitions. The club played {{an active role in}} the formation of the Premier League in 1992, and two doubles followed in 1998 and 2002. Arsenal made league history in 2003–04 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> the first team in a 38-game season to go unbeaten. In the 2000s, Arsenal were finalists in both the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League, and have since equalled Real Madrid's record for most consecutive seasons in the latter competition.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, however, had no {{intentions}} {{of letting the}} British Band escape. The Warrior, a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, while American allied-Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks. On August 1, the Warrior arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Bad Axe River, where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people. Black Hawk raised a white flag in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation. The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the white flag to set an ambush. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the Warrior was injured.|$|E

5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> old. Women govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E
5|$|The prebendary of New Sleaford or Lafford had {{a seat in}} the Lincoln Cathedral; it is {{not known}} when it was established, but it was {{confirmed}} by the Pope in 1146 and 1163, and was in the patronage of the bishop. Sleaford's tithes paid to the prebendary were valued at £11 19s. 7d. (£11.98) in 1616. After the enclosure of Sleaford's fields, a farm at Holdingham Anna was allotted to the prebendary in place of the tithes. The Prebendal Court of Sleaford had jurisdiction over New and Old Sleaford and Holdingham to grant administration and probate. The parishes of New and Old Sleaford were in the peculiar jurisdiction of the predendary until 1846, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> part of Aswardhurn and Lafford Rural Deanery. In 1866 they were placed in Aswardhurn and Lafford No. 2 Rural Deanery, from 1884 in the Lafford No. 2 Rural Deanery, the Lafford South Rural Deanery from 1910, and since 1968, the Lafford Rural Deanery.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the airlanding brigade almost equalled that of an airborne division's two parachute brigades. To support the four infantry battalions, the brigade also had its own artillery, engineer and reconnaissance units until 1942, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>became</b> divisional assets. Another change that affected the brigade occurred in May 1943, when the Ulsters and the OBLI left to form the 6th Airlanding Brigade, of the 6th Airborne Division. When the brigade returned to the United Kingdom, it was assigned the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) in December 1943, a 2nd Line Territorial Army unit, which had until then been on home defence duties, stationed in the Orkney and Shetland islands.|$|E
