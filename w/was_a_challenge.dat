5|$|Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man {{military}} police unit {{arrived at the}} site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. The horses were used for playing polo. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b> Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.|$|E
5|$|McDiarmid {{noticed that}} the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his {{character}} than in previous films. Lightsaber combat <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to the 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.|$|E
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b> Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E

The {{first international}} tournament, the inaugural edition of the British Home Championship, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity {{in other parts of}} the world at the turn of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2015, Gočeva {{embarked}} on a small tour in which she promoted the two albums from the project Makedonsko Devojče. The concerts took place in Bitola at Heraclea Lyncestis on 23 July, in Ohrid at the Ancient Theatre of Ohrid on 24 July and in Dojran at a city park on 2 August. The singer also performed in Prilep at the Pivo Fest festival on 15 July 2016, where she sang numerous songs from the album. In 2015, Gočeva explained {{in an interview that}} performing at the concerts where she sang songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for her due to the great vocal effort she had to put and the lack of background vocals during the live performances. She also revealed that a band of ten musicians was specifically assembled to perform the music from the album live; it consisted of several Macedonian music academics who accompanied her on-stage.|$|E
5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact}} that Dyer had been a {{resident}} in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E

Initially, Viz hoped to have the magazine targeted to all age groups, however to allow for greater freedom on content, {{the decision was made to}} mark the magazine as being for readers 13 years of age and older. However, with greater attention being focused on manga as it became available in mainstream outlets, some titles were edited for content. Thompson noted that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> working with some of the artists whose works would appear in the first issue, who worried about excessive alterations.|$|E
5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E

The Sounders had depth that could withstand losing players, and did not rest starters in the lead-up to the final game. The Union rested several starters {{during the previous}} weekend's league match. Philadelphia's Casey, Le Toux, and Cristian Maidana were significant attacking threats, while Seattle had the striking pair of Martins and Clint Dempsey. Defensively, Edu was Philadelphia's strongest player. Seattle also had a strong defense with young national team prospect DeAndre Yedlin, and eventual MLS Defender of the Year Chad Marshall.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to only be {{developing}} games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed the challenge to Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within Monolith Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project {{that did not have}} the desired quality for their systems. The sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|E
5|$|The smaller {{time frame}} of {{development}} for Left Behind gave the team {{an opportunity to}} trial mechanics and ideas that {{they were unable to}} test on the main game. With the game's combat, an added feature was to allow players to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, allowing an easier escape. The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more. The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies. The team found that creating some gameplay mechanics <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge,</b> with even fewer combat scenarios in Left Behind than in The Last of Us. The animation of the masks also presented a challenge, due to the number of joints; it took various iterations before the final design was implemented.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E

5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge,</b> and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E
