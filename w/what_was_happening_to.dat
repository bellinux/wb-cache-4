5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not}} know about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E

25|$|The PSFS sign {{has become}} a Philadelphia icon. At the time of construction, {{abbreviations}} were rarely used but architects Howe and Lescaze pushed for their use as the full name would have been illegible from the ground.

25|$|The law {{was named}} after Sir Thomas Gresham, a sixteenth-century {{financial}} agent of the English Crown {{in the city of}} Antwerp, to explain to Queen Elizabeth I <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> the English shilling. Her father, Henry VIII, had replaced 40 percent of the silver in the coin with base metals, to increase the government's income without raising taxes. Astute English merchants and even ordinary subjects would save the good shillings from pure silver and circulate the bad ones; hence, the bad money would be used whenever possible, and the good coinage would be saved and disappear from circulation.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{the defense}} would be denied to people {{experiencing}} symptoms of intoxication {{who continued to}} consume the spiked drink because {{they ought to have}} known <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> them. Equally, if no further consumption occurred but they ought to have recognized that they were affected by an unknown substance, beginning an activity such as driving would not fall within the defense. In other words, the policy underpinning the operation of the law favors the protection of the public as against the interests of an individual who recklessly or with wilful blindness exposes the public to danger.|$|E
25|$|The two escort {{ships were}} unaware of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> General Belgrano, as {{they were out of}} touch with her in the gloom and had not seen the {{distress}} rockets or lamp signals. Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking {{at the end of its}} run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised that something had happened to General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.|$|E

25|$|To keep up morale, Gordon had a {{military}} band perform concerts {{in the central}} plaza every Friday and Sunday evenings for free, and cast his own decorations for his men. Though the telegraph lines to Cairo were cut, Gordon used the remaining telegraph lines to build his own telegraph network within Khartoum linking the men holding the walls of Khartoum to Governor-General's palace, thus keeping him well informed of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> <b>To</b> slow down the Ansar assaults, Gordon built primitive landmines out of water cans stuffed with dynamite and to confuse the enemy about his numbers, he put up wooden dummies in uniform along the walls of Khartoum facing the Blue Nile.|$|E
25|$|After Villaronga {{retired from}} the military, he decided to make Killeen his home {{and went to work}} as a {{part-time}} professor at Central Texas College, where he taught logistics, math and computer science. Unable to get a full-time position as a professor because he lacked a master's degree in education, he decided to work as a consultant for the Department of Defense and later for Brown & Root Services Corporation in Houston. Villaronga applied and was hired by the Texas Attorney General's Office in Austin, and served with the Child Support Enforcement Division. He designed and implemented a case tracking system that provided visibility as to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> cases in each of the organizations involved with CSED.|$|E
25|$|In a dream, Hector, {{the fallen}} Trojan prince, advised Aeneas to flee with his family. Aeneas awoke and saw with horror <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> his beloved city. At first {{he tried to}} fight the enemy, but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone {{to fend off the}} Greeks. He {{witnessed}} the murder of Priam by Achilles' son Pyrrhus. His mother, Venus, appeared to him and led him back to his house. Aeneas tells of his escape with his son, Ascanius, and father, Anchises, after the occurrence of various omens (Ascanius' head catching fire without his being harmed, a clap of thunder and a shooting star). After fleeing Troy, he goes back for his wife, Creusa, but she has been killed. Her ghost tells him that his destiny is to found a new city in the West.|$|E

500|$|During {{a seventh}} {{interview}} the next day, Raghip described noises he said Blakelock had {{made during the}} attack.

[...] He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough. Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December 1985, under the doctrine of common purpose.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of the [...] University of Melbourne, where she studied medicine and excelled at sports, Mary qualified as a general practitioner in 1921 and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital. Her work was mainly with poor women, many of whom lived in unsanitary conditions and had inadequate diets. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy. She recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> them, and provided information on birth control {{at a time when}} many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. [...] "She broke taboos", Della Hilton later wrote, and [...] "made forbidden subjects not only matters for discussion, but for action".|$|E

500|$|Mary {{joined the}} Melbourne District Nursing Society in 1931 and was its vice {{president}} from 1943 to 1953. She banded together with George Simpson and Victor Wallace {{to establish the}} Women's Welfare Clinic to offer advice on birth control, {{at a time when}} many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. This clinic functioned for one day a week until 1945 when it was discontinued, as the advice it offered could by then be obtained elsewhere. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy, but she recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> them.

500|$|Although {{her husband}} {{was aware of the}} books she was writing, he showed no {{interest}} in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste. She took the name [...] "Bannon" [...] from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it. She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage, however, and in realizing that [...] "not all lesbians were nice people", she took these frustrations out on her characters. [...] "I couldn't stand some of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> me–but Beebo could take it. Beebo really, in a way, had my nervous breakdown for me...I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger that I was not able to express," [...] she recalled later. Women in the Shadows was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon's readers. The book examined interracial relationships, self-loathing in matters of sexuality and race, alcoholism, jealousy, violence, and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s, also explored the intricate details {{of what it was like}} to pass as heterosexual in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time.|$|E

[...] "The really left-of-center artists, you really wonder about them. Can the world catch up? Can the culture meet them in the middle? That’s what the adventure is. It doesn’t always happen, but it should and it could." [...] Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, states, [...] "You've got to bend culture around to suit you, and I think M.I.A has done that" [...] adding that M.I.A.'s composition and production skills were a major attraction for him. As a vocalist, M.I.A. is recognisable by her distinctive whooping, chanting voice, which {{has been described as}} having an [...] "indelible, nursery-rhyme swing." [...] She has adopted different singing styles on her songs, from aggressive raps, to semi-spoken and melodic vocals. She has said of the sometimes [...] "unaffected" [...] vocals and delivery of her lyrics, [...] "It is what it is. Most people would just put it down to me being lazy.
