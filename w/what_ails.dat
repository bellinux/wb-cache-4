25|$|Fernandes liked {{writing and}} journalism even during his student days. He was {{the editor of}} a Konkani {{language}} monthly Konkani Yuvak (Konkani Youth) in 1949. The same year, he was the editor of the Raithavani weekly in Kannada. The Dockman weekly in English, which had ceased publication, reappeared under the editorship of Fernandes in 1952–53. Though not a prolific writer, Fernandes has penned several books on politics such as <b>What</b> <b>Ails</b> the Socialists (1972), The Kashmir Problem, Railway Strike of 1974, Dignity for All: Essays in Socialism and Democracy (1991), and his autobiography titled George Fernandes Speaks (1991). He was also {{the editor of a}}n English monthly, The Other Side, and the chairman on the editorial board of the Hindi monthly Pratipaksh. A human rights activist, Fernandes {{has been a member of}} the Amnesty International, People's Union for Civil Liberties, and the Press Council of India.|$|E
500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I {{think there will be a}} lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{election}} day, Bevin garnered 125,759 votes– 35.4% of the vote– to McConnell's 213,666 votes (60.2%); {{the remaining}} votes were scattered among three lower-profile candidates. In his concession speech, Bevin opined [...] "there is zero {{chance that the}} solutions for <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> us {{is going to come}} from the Democratic Party", but did not endorse McConnell. He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say {{with all due respect to}} a lot of folks who might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to get over it and move on. We have new races to run and new decisions to make. There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears." [...] McConnell defeated Grimes in the general election, and Bevin eventually told reporters that he voted for McConnell.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{literature}} is diverse and includes themes such as Indian politics in books like <b>What</b> <b>Ails</b> the Socialists by George Fernandes, historical awakening, in {{books such as}} Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians by Alan Machado Prabhu, and sexual desires, in The Revised Kama Sutra: A Novel of Colonialism and Desire by Richard Crasta. Genealogist Michael Lobo published the first genealogical Encyclopedia of the Mangalorean Catholic community in 1999. This genealogical encyclopaedia, which exceeds 6,000 pages, covers over a thousand families, {{each of which is}} researched as far as its ancestry can be traced. [...] Three offshoots have thus far been launched, which include Mangaloreans Worldwide– An International Directory (1999), Distinguished Mangalorean Catholics (2000), and The Mangalorean Catholic Community– A Professional History / Directory (2002). William Robert da Silva translated the first complete Bible from English into Konkani. The work entitled Baibol (Bible) was written in the Kannada script, and published by the Mangalore-based Konkani Bible committee in 1997. In 2000, the Mangalore Diocese also released a Konkani Bible in Kannada script entitled Pavitr Pustak (Holy Book), which was made available online on 26 July 2007.|$|E
500|$|Christina Del Valle {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} BusinessWeek, and wrote: [...] "Flying Blind, Flying Safe is an incisive primer on <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> the aviation industry and the feds' regulation of it". A subsequent article in BusinessWeek highlighted the book among [...] "The Best Business Books of 1997". In a review in The Washington Post, Judy Mann called the book [...] "a scathing -- and frightening -- indictment of the FAA, the multibillion-dollar airline industry and its lapdogs in Congress". James T. Yenckel of The Washington Post called the book [...] "frightening" [...] and [...] "informative", and wrote that [...] "passengers should {{have this kind of}} safety information when choosing a flight." [...] In a review for The Virginian-Pilot, Michael Anft wrote: [...] "She may be to the airplane what Ralph Nader was to the automobile." [...] Bill Wallace gave the book a favorable review in the San Francisco Chronicle, and wrote: [...] "Part memoir, part expose, her book gives an inside view of how the FAA does its job of regulating air travel -- and how it frequently fails." [...] R.J. Ignelzi gave the book a positive recommendation in a review for The San Diego Union-Tribune, and commented: [...] "Mary Schiavo's candid evaluation of the Federal Aviation Administration, airport security and air traffic controllers will give even the occasional flier some apprehension. Still, it should be read." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavens! Collie ill and {{you never}} told me!" [...] cried Moore. [...] "I can't believe it. She's so healthy and strong. <b>What</b> <b>ailed</b> her, Bent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, she's ill--that's all I know," [...] replied Lane, slowly. [...] "Rose didn't tell me <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> her. I {{just found}} out she was here." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{waited in}} silence, sadly, patiently. It {{was no good}} being {{impatient}} with him. At any rate, he would tell her now <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> him.|$|R
2500|$|Threats {{like that}} are no way to conduct the serious, sober discussions needed {{to figure out exactly}} <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> the movie {{industry}} and to come up with solutions. [...] It was Hollywood's arrogance in pushing bills through Congress without proper vetting that caused them to be withdrawn; these threats also are not helpful to figuring out <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> the industry and how to solve their issues.|$|E

2500|$|Hecimovich {{refers to}} Jenny Wren, Mr. Wegg, and Mr. Venus, all {{seemingly}} minor characters in Our Mutual Friend whom Henry James dismissed as [...] "pathetic characters" [...] in his 1865 {{review of the}} novel, as [...] "important riddlers and riddlees." [...] Hecimovich states, [...] "Through the example of his minor characters, Dickens directs his readers to seek, with the chief characters, order and structure out of the apparent disjunctive 'rubbish' in the novel, to analyze and articulate <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> a fallen London... Only then can the reader, mimicking the action of certain characters, create something 'harmonious' and beautiful out of the fractured waste land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But please, sir," [...] {{said the}} girl, with immense gravity, [...] "mayn't I let him die, and not find out <b>what's</b> <b>ailing</b> him, so I can marry the maire?" ...|$|R
60|$|The locksmith's wife {{knew better}} perhaps, than he, <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> her daughter. But Mrs Varden being quite an altered woman--for the riots {{had done that}} good--added her word to his, and comforted her with similar representations.|$|R
6000|$|... "It gets me," [...] he said. [...] "There can't be {{land around}} here. We never drifted or ran like that. The whole voyage has been crazy. Will you kindly go up, Mr. Snow, and see <b>what's</b> <b>ailing</b> Jackie." ...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout her life, Bet {{exhibited}} a strong spirit {{and sense of}} self. She came into conflict with Hannah Ashley, {{who was raised in}} the strict Dutch culture of the New York colony. In 1780, Bet prevented Hannah from striking a servant girl with a heated shovel; Elizabeth shielded the girl and received a deep wound in her arm. As the wound healed, Bet left it uncovered as evidence of her harsh treatment. Catharine Maria Sedgwick quotes Elizabeth saying, [...] "Madam never again laid her hand on Lizzy [...] 'I had a bad arm all winter, but Madam had the worst of it. I never covered the wound, and when people said to me, before Madam, [...] "Betty, <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> your arm?" [...] I only answered - 'ask missis!' Which was the slave and which was the real misses?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Who {{may that}} proud damsel be, and <b>what</b> <b>ails</b> her at my roses?" [...] quoth Charlotte, sitting herself {{down again and}} still {{following}} them with her eyes.

6000|$|When {{mother had}} poured out the tea, we sat silently at table. It {{was on the}} tip of our tongues to ask Lettie <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> her, but we were {{experienced}} and we refrained. After a while she said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>ailed</b> him {{we could}} not tell; {{but there was no}} waking him. Equally in vain were all his dear spouse's cuffs, pinches, and other endearments; he lay like a log, face up, snoring away like a cavalry trumpeter.|$|R
6000|$|Thereupon Lazarus {{took the}} log, threw it away, and laid himself down in its stead. Towards dawn, {{he began to}} groan, and when the Draken heard that, they asked <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> him, to which he made answer: 'The gnats have stung me horribly.' ...|$|R

60|$|Sir Geoffrey {{asked him}} <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> his wife. He {{answered}} {{that he did}} not know, having never seen the like till that morning, when he had been called in to attend three such cases in houses far apart, whereof one died within ten minutes of being struck.|$|R
60|$|When the {{consultation}} {{of the men}} ended, Lee Stanton turned to Flo. And Carley {{did not need to}} see the young man look twice to divine <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> him. He was caught in the toils of love. But seeing through Flo Hutter was entirely another matter.|$|R

60|$|But {{what had}} befallen the night? The moon {{was not yet}} set, {{and we were all}} in shadow: I could {{scarcely}} see my master's face, near as I was.

6000|$|... "I {{asked him}} <b>what</b> <b>ailed</b> him, and he burst {{out into a}} flood of abuse. He called me a Wizard, a Sham, a Fraud, a Bringer of bad luck! I had promised to kill the elephants, and I had so {{arranged}} things that the elephants had nearly killed him, etc.|$|R
6000|$|The {{other five}} were furious; even Mr. Lorrimer, though his man had won, could not smile in {{face of such}} imbecility.
