Mason said [...] "It's hard for Chris because he has a girlfriend who he's been with for some time. To try and tell someone in this situation would be really difficult". Summer initially takes the news well and plays it down, but when fellow student Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) discovers that one of her classmates is gay, she goes out of her <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> who it is and expose them.

Instead of Smalley's figure of 1GHz for the atomic placement frequency, {{they point out that}} Nanosystems suggested a frequency of 1MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a straw man argument, writing that [...] "in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal." [...] The authors closed by stating that the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that [...] "there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible." ...|$|E

Mohammed el-Jarh, a Libyan analyst based in Tripoli, claimed that members of the House of Representatives were determined to hold Obaidi accountable after his comments. Benghazi representative Salih al-Shawihidi denied that there were plans to replace Obaidi with Saad al-Qatrani. The following day a letter that had been sent by Obaidi to numerous militias on the 6 August was leaked on the internet. In the letter Obaidi instructed all groups, including the Libya Shield Forces which are officially under his command, and which he had assigned to Tripoli, to stop fighting. The letter reflected the House of Representatives decision No. 3, which had been issued on the same day, and which ordered all sides to commit to an immediate cease fire.|$|E

50|$|Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics yields {{reliable}} {{results in}} the field of ductile materials like steel. Most of the experiments and theories in fracture mechanics are formulated taking ductile materials as object of interest. But if we compare the salient features in LEFM with results derived from the testing of concrete, we may find it irrelevant and sometimes trivial. For example, LEFM permits infinite stress at crack tip. This makes no sense in real analysis of concrete where the stress at crack tip is fixed. And LEFM fails to calculate stress at crack tip precisely. So we need some other <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what is stress at crack tip and distribution stress near crack tip.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to draw readers’ {{attention}} <b>to</b> the myriad <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about abuse towards people with learning disabilities. Design/methodology/approach – Whilst acknowledging the continued importance of research studies specifically focused on the topic of abuse, this commentary reviews information about abuse of adults with learning disabilities from other sources, e. g., through service audits, studies on sexual and personal relationships. Findings – Having many sources of information about abuse against people with learning disabilities is a good thing, but there are some problems associated with this. First, some forms of abuse appear to be easier <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about than others, and second, the difficult question of how the information can be used to improve the lives of people with learning disabilities. Originality/value – This commentary encourages readers to take a broad view of abuse of people with learning disabilities and to use all the knowledge available to support individuals, whilst at the same time demanding social changes...|$|R

30|$|It is also {{important}} to identify whether users would want to use the application (Lazar et al. 2010). Before introducing any form of mobile learning, students’ perceptions of mobile learning need to be investigated or their readiness considered (Cheon et al. 2012; Corbeil and Valdes-Corbeil 2007), as learners may not be willing to accept it (Wang et al. 2009). Also, there is a need <b>to</b> implement <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> if and how students make use of the provided feedback (Price et al. 2010) to understand the feedback culture. This dimension is called willingness and attitude. It is equally important to investigate whether current technology has the potential to enable the mobile learning activities planned or to help solve the identified issues such as those identified in this research. This dimension is called IT infrastructure. All these four dimensions justify the exploration aspect in this initial framework.|$|R
