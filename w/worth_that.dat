At the request of Canadian television producer Nancy Bacal, he attended a private recital by Shankar, {{in the company of}} singers Judy Collins and Leonard Cohen, a performance that convinced <b>Worth</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to direct the planned Shankar documentary after all. Worth also served as producer, and he and Bacal worked on a script at Collins's house in California.|$|E
25|$|Each {{round of}} the game starts with a bidding phase to {{determine}} declarer and the required minimum Game Value (explained below). Then, ten tricks are played, allowing players to take trick points. Each card has a face value (except in Null games) and is <b>worth</b> <b>that</b> number of points for the player winning the trick. The total face value of all cards is 120 points. Declarer's goal is {{to take at least}} 61 points in tricks in order to win that {{round of the}} game. Otherwise, the defending team wins the round. Points from tricks are not directly added to the players' overall score, they are used only to determine the outcome of the game (win or loss for declarer), although winning by certain margins may increase the score for that round.|$|E

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't <b>worth</b> <b>that</b> kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I {{have nothing to say}} on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of his}} death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|Much of Imogen's {{choral music}} {{was written for}} amateur performance. Critics have {{observed}} a clear distinction in quality between these pieces and the choral works written for professional choirs, particularly those for women's voices. These latter pieces, says Tinker, incorporate her best work as an original composer. Record companies were slow in recognising Imogen's commercial potential, and not until 2009 was a [...] CD issued devoted entirely to her music—a selection of her works for strings. [...] The Guardians reviewer welcomed the recording: [...] "here {{is a great deal}} of English music of far less <b>worth</b> <b>that</b> is frequently praised to the skies". In 2012 a selection of her choral music, sung by the Clare College Choir, was recorded by Harmonia Mundi. One review of this recording picks out Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow, written for female voices with harp accompaniment, as [...] " [...] an insight into her own, softly nuanced, pioneering voice". Another mentions the [...] "Three Psalms" [...] setting, where [...] "inner rhythms are underscored by the subtle string ostinatos pulsing beneath".|$|E
500|$|A major issue, {{going into}} the 1896 {{election}} cycle, was {{the question of the}} currency. [...] The United States, since 1873, had effectively been on the gold standard—the metal, if presented to the government, would be assayed and struck into coin for a slight charge to cover expenses. [...] Silver, on the other hand, though widely mined, could not be presented for conversion into coin, but had to be sold as a commodity. [...] The gold standard was unpopular in many agricultural and mining areas, as the quantity of gold available limited the money supply, making it difficult for farmers to obtain loans and pay debts. [...] Advocates of the free and unlimited coinage of silver believed that doing so would cure the country's economic malaise by increasing the money supply. [...] Advocates of the gold standard argued that a [...] "free silver" [...] policy (sometimes called [...] "bimetallism") would inflate the currency, and lead to difficulties in international trade with nations on the gold standard. [...] At the time, the precious metal in a silver dollar was worth about $0.53, and under such proposals, silver <b>worth</b> <b>that</b> much would be returned to depositors as a one-dollar coin, [...] "free"—that is, without a charge for the Mint's costs for assaying and coining.|$|E

500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was <b>worth</b> <b>that</b> price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now that I have a franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{released}} the new cents {{to the public}} on May 25, 1857. In anticipation of large popular demand, Mint authorities built a temporary wooden structure {{in the courtyard of}} the Philadelphia facility. On the morning of the date of release, hundreds of people queued, one line for those exchanging Spanish silver for cents, the other for those bringing in old copper cents and half cents. From 9 am, clerks paid out cents for the old pieces; outside the Mint precincts, early purchasers sold the new cents at a premium. Snowden wrote to Guthrie, [...] "the demand for them is enormous… we had on hand this morning $30,000 <b>worth,</b> <b>that</b> is three million pieces. Nearly all of this amount will be paid out today." [...] The 1856 specimen became publicly known about the time of issuance, and had the public checking their pocket change; 1856 small cents sold for as much as $2 by 1859. The public interest in the new cents set off a coin collecting boom: in addition to seeking the rare 1856 cent, some tried to collect sets of large cents back to 1793, and found they would have to pay a premium for the rarer dates.|$|E
500|$|Stigand was {{probably}} the most lavish clerical donor of his period, when great men gave to churches on an unprecedented scale. He was a benefactor to the Abbey of Ely, and gave large gold or silver crucifixes to Ely, St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, and to his cathedral church at Winchester. The crucifixes given to Ely, Bury and Winchester all appear to have had about life-size figures of Christ with matching figures of the Virgin and John the Evangelist, as is recorded in the monastic histories, and were probably permanently mounted over the altar or elsewhere. These would have been made with thin sheets of precious metal over a wooden core. No comparably early rood crosses with the side figures of Mary and John seem to survive, though we have large painted wooden crucifixes like the German Gero Cross of around 980, and the Volto Santo of Lucca (renewed with a later figure) which is known to have inspired Leofstan, Abbot of Bury (d. 1065) to create a similar figure, perhaps covered in precious metal, on his return from a visit to Rome. To Ely he gave gold and silver vessels for the altar, and a chasuble embroidered in gold [...] "of such inestimable workmanship and <b>worth,</b> <b>that</b> none in the kingdom is considered richer or more valuable". Although it does not appear that Stigand ever travelled to Rome, there are indications that Stigand did go on pilgrimage. A 12th-century life of Saint Willibrord, written at the Abbey of Echternach in what is now Luxembourg, records that [...] "to this place also came Stigand, the eminent archbishop of the English". In the work, Stigand is recorded as giving rich gifts to the abbey as well as relics of saints.|$|E

2500|$|Once back in New York, Worth {{contacted}} Harrison, {{hoping to}} secure support from United Artists, the film studio {{responsible for the}} Beatles' feature films A Hard Day's Night, Help! and Yellow Submarine. Late in 1970, Harrison attended a special screening of the assembled footage and was so moved, according to <b>Worth,</b> <b>that</b> within days he offered the services of the Beatles' own Apple Films as a distributor.

2500|$|Although {{generally}} {{supportive of}} the [...] "confessional" [...] style of her friend, Robert Lowell, she drew the line at his highly controversial book The Dolphin (1973), in which he used and altered private letters from his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick (whom he divorced after 23 years of marriage), as material for his poems. In a letter to Lowell, dated March 21, 1972, Bishop strongly urged him against publishing the book, writing, [...] "One can use one's life as material —one does anyway—but these letters—aren't you violating a trust?

2500|$|Spiritualist and New Thought {{movements}} such as [...] "Spiritual but not Religious" [...] {{created new}} opportunities for women to veer away from the androcentrism of Abrahamic traditions and blaze their own spiritual paths. Many of the themes that are quintessential to feminist spiritual and religious thought are also embodied in ecological spiritualities. Ecological spiritualities are best understood as being rooted {{in the belief that}} the natural world is a medium for divine revelation and that nature possesses a spiritual <b>worth</b> <b>that</b> goes beyond the functional utility it might have for humans. The considerable overlap between ecological and feminist spiritualities can be seen in their shared central tenets of [...] "inner growth, ecological wisdom, gender equality, and social responsibility".|$|E
