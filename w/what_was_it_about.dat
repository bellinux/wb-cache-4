2500|$|Pietrzak's mother, Henryka Pietrzak-Varga has {{repeatedly}} stated {{she believes the}} murders were racially motivated, as her son and daughter-in-law were not affluent individuals. On November 11, 2008 (Veteran's Day), Pietrzak's mother composed a formal letter to president-elect Barack Obama in which she discussed what her son and daughter-in-law had endured, and the possible primary motive for the murders. In this letter, Henryka stated: [...] "If it was a robbery, why didn't they come when nobody was home instead of {{in the dead of}} night, armed to the teeth? ... <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> my son and daughter-in-law that inspired such hatred and loathing?" [...] Seven months later on July 27, 2009, the Obama administration responded with generic form letter of the type issued to all soldiers killed in combat. When knowledge of this indirect, insincere reply reached the news media, the Obama administration issued an apology.|$|E

5000|$|.....I {{originally}} intended to study traditional American politics, but became distracted by the upheavals of the era. I considered myself on the political left, but hardly a revolutionary. Some of my friends and classmates, however, {{were associated with the}} Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC), a spin-off of Students for a Democratic Society...."Two political events from those tumultuous years gave me my lifetime research agenda. During the 1968 presidential election, a number of radicals, including some I knew, supported George Wallace for president. They certainly had no sympathy for the Alabama governor, but argued that his election would precipitate an American revolution. Their rationale was that a dose of fascism would prepare the way for American radicalism...."After the American incursion into Cambodia in 1970, student protestors held a mass meeting on the Chapel Hill campus. A number of speakers called for a student strike to shut down the university. My advisor, Dr Lewis Lipsitz, {{had been one of the}} most prominent leftists on campus for many years.... When Lew urged the crowd not to strike since a university should not be closed down, he was booed."Convinced that the student left was losing its grip on reality and was likely to fail, I became increasingly intrigued by the question of why the American left always seemed to fail. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> America or the left that accounted for 'American exceptionalism,' the inability of socialists or communists to make inroads comparable to those it enjoyed elsewhere?" ...|$|E
