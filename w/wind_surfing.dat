50|$|Thirroul is {{an exposed}} beach and reef break, and has {{reliable}} surf all year. The most desirable <b>wind</b> for <b>surfing</b> in Thirroul is offshore winds {{from the west}} north-west. Most of the surf in Thirroul comes from groundswells, with the best swell direction the south-east. The beach break provides for both left and right-handers. Caution should be taken with rips, rocks, sharks and, during the summer, bluebottles.|$|R
50|$|The {{best season}} for surfing is winter (May-September), with waves up to 3 meters high and cold water. During the summer the waves are smaller and the {{northeast}} <b>wind</b> usually jeopardizes <b>surfing</b> conditions.|$|R
25|$|The summer Trade Winds {{and winter}} swells of the Atlantic {{make this a}} year-round surfers' paradise, with more exposed areas on {{the north and west}} shores such as Corralejo and El Cotillo proving most popular. <b>Wind</b> <b>surfing</b> takes places at {{locations}} around the island. Sailors, scuba divers and big-game fishermen are all drawn to these clear blue Atlantic waters where whales, dolphins, marlin and turtles are all common sights. With many hills present throughout the Island, hikers are also attracted to this Island.|$|E
25|$|A large {{proportion}} of Kenya's tourism centres on safaris and tours of its national parks and game reserves. While most tourists visit for safari there are also cultural aspects {{of the country to}} explore in cities like Mombasa and Lamu on the Coast. The Masai Mara National Reserve is usually where the Maasai Village can be found; a site that most tourists like to visit. There are also many beaches to visit in Kenya, where one can experience water boarding, surfing, <b>wind</b> <b>surfing</b> and many more fun activities that are good for Kenya's economy.|$|E
25|$|Port Phillip hosts many beaches, most {{of which}} are flat, shallow and long, with very small breaks making {{swimming}} quite safe. This attracts many tourists, mostly families, to the beaches of Port Phillip during the summer months and school holidays. Water sports such as body boarding and surfing are difficult or impossible, except in extreme weather conditions. However, stand up paddle boarding (SUP), kite surfing and <b>wind</b> <b>surfing</b> are very popular. Most sandy beaches are located on the bay's northern, eastern and southern shorelines, while the western shorelines host a few sandy beaches, there mostly exists a greater variety of beaches, swampy wetlands and mangroves. The occasional pebble beach and rocky cliffs can also be found, mostly in the southern reaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{surf zone}} is place of {{convergence}} of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds {{to the beach}} and interact with local <b>winds</b> to make <b>surfing</b> waves.|$|R
50|$|In general groundswell {{produces}} {{waves that}} are much better for <b>surfing.</b> <b>Wind</b> swell is usually smaller, and almost always choppier and harder to surf than groundswell. Although both are present at most surf spots, groundswell creates much better breaking waves and dominates the lineup. This distinct separation occurs because groundswell originates far from the shore and has more time to separate into organized patterns, which are much easier to surf.|$|R
50|$|Silloth also {{prides itself}} in its {{coastline}} along the Solway Firth {{which has been}} described {{in one of the}} country's leading sea fishing publications, Total Sea Angling, as having the best flatfish fishing coastline in the country, with over 20 mi of beach and promenade to choose from.

40|$|We use {{variation}} in <b>wind</b> speeds at <b>surfing</b> locations in Switzerland as exogenous shifters of users' propensity to post content about their surfing activity onto an online social network. We exploit this variation {{to test whether}} users' social ties on the network have a causal effect on their content generation, and whether conent generation in turn has a similar causal effect on the users' abilty to form social ties. Economically significant causal effects of this kind can produce positive feedback that generate multiplier e¤ects to interventions that subsidize tie formation. We argue these interventions can therefore {{be the basis of}} a strategy by the rm to indirectly faciliate content generation on the site. The exogenous variation provided by wind speeds enable us to measure this feedback empirically and to assess the return on investment from such policies. We use a detailed dataset from an online social network that comprises the complete details of social tie formation and content generation on the site. The richness of he data enable us to control for several spurious confounds that have typically plagued empirical analysis of social interactions. Our results show evidence for significant positive feedback in user generated content. We discuss the implications of the estimates for the management of the content and the growth of the network. ...|$|R

Similar to the Columbia Valley and Walla Walla AVAs, this appellation also crosses over the southern Washington border into Oregon where Pinot noir and Pinot gris are grown. Located along the Columbia River where it bisects the Cascade Range, parts of the AVA fall within a wind tunnel that is a popular tourist destination for <b>wind</b> <b>surfing</b> but can be too fierce for viticulture. Most of the vineyards planted on the Washington side of the appellation are located on southward facing slopes along the river where they can receive some protection from the winds. Depending upon the elevation, vineyards in the Columbia Gorge AVA receive anywhere from 18-30inches (46-76 centimeters) of rain annually.|$|E
40|$|We use {{variation}} in <b>wind</b> speeds at <b>surfing</b> locations in Switzerland as exogenous shifters of users' propensity to post content about their surfing activity onto an online social network. We exploit this variation {{to test whether}} users' online content generation activity has a causal effect on their social ties. Under weak monotonicity assumptions, we also estimate nonparametric bounds on the causal effect of user's social ties in turn on their content generation activity. Economically significant causal effects of the type above can produce positive feedback that generates local network effects in content generation. We find evidence for such network effects. We argue this feedback generates a multiplier effect on interventions that subsidize tie formation. We use our estimates to measure the ROI from such interventions and discuss implications for the site's monetization strategy. Our empirical strategy provides one way to address a significant identification challenge with online social network data that the observed network structure is endogenous to the actions taken by agents on the network. Augmenting the model of agent's actions with {{a model for the}} network structure requires solving a formidable network formation game. Our approach to this problem is to conduct inference with an incomplete model of network formation under weak assumptions that deliver informative bounds on the causal effects of interest, while avoiding taking a strong stand on a specific model of network formation. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2003 / 04, {{under the auspices of}} the Western Australian Department of Fisheries, shark {{surveillance}} patrols were flown twice daily along 143 km of Perth metropolitan coastline from Two Rocks Beach in the north to Avalon Beach in the south. A Murdoch University observer flew with the patrol on 106 flights to complete a stratified survey of beach usage that covered all weekend days and two week days each week from November 2003 to January 2004. On each flight, instantaneous counts of beach users engaged in various activities were made over the 43 beaches in the region. Beach activities were classified as swimming, walking, sunbathing, board riding, fishing, surfski / kayaking and kite /wind surfing. From November 2003 to January 2004, the number of beach users increased each month. There was a significant difference between usage on week days and weekends in November and December but not in January. Maximum counts were attained during the mid-morning flights on 26 th December 2003 and 11 th January 2004 when, respectively, there were 12 456 and 11 835 people recorded between Two Rocks and Avalon Beaches. Six beaches had consistently high numbers of people, namely, Scarborough, Port, Cottesloe, North Mullaloo, Hillarys and City Beaches. Sun bathing, swimming and walking were the dominant activities on beaches in the Perth metropolitan region with many people engaged in these activities throughout the study area. Board riding was popular at a limited number of beaches (e. g. Scarborough, Secret Harbour and Trigg) and low numbers of people paddling surf skis / kayaks, <b>wind</b> / kite <b>surfing</b> and fishing were recorded. Detailed temporal use patterns at hourly resolution from 06 : 00 to 12 : 00 were determined for all beaches in the central sector from Hillarys Beach to Port Beach which were flown over more frequently than the northern and southern sectors of the Perth metropolitan coastline. In general, there was a consistent pattern of increasing usage from 06 : 00 to 12 : 00, although for some activities, there were specific periods of use. For each northern and southern beach, the proportion of people engaged in the various beach activities on week days and weekends during {{the summer of}} 2003 / 04 was determined...|$|R
