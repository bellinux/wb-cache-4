40|$|Pasteurella multocida is the causative {{agent of}} a range of <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> <b>economic</b> <b>importance</b> in {{production}} animals. Many systems have been employed to identify virulence factors of P. multocida, including in vivo expression technology (IVET), signature-tagged mutagenesis, and whole-genome expression profiling. In a previous study in which IVET was used with P. multocida, nrfE was identified as a gene that is preferentially expressed in vivo. In Escherichia coli, nrfE is part of the formate-dependent nitrite reductase system involved in utilizing available nitrite as an electron accepter during growth under anaerobic conditions. In this study, we constructed an isogenic P. multocida strain that was unable to reduce nitrite under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, thereby demonstrating that P. multocida nrfE is essential for nitrite reduction. However, the nrfE mutant was still virulent in mice. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that nrfE was regulated independently of nrfABCD by an independent promoter that is likely to be upregulated in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The intense {{exploration}} of forests for wood production in Brazil {{over the past}} decades {{has led to the}} reduction of the population of native trees <b>with</b> <b>economic</b> <b>importance</b> and many efforts have been carried out to conserve these species. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterise the germination process and evaluate the effect of different drying rates on physiological and ultrastructural changes of Araucaria angustifolia seeds from two provenances. The imbibition pattern was linear during germination and when seeds were cut, water uptake increased, indicating that the seed coat inhibits water absorption although final germination percentage was not affected. Seeds subjected to fast drying with silica gel or slow drying in a cold room did not show interaction between water content (WC) and drying rate, and total viability was lost when seeds were dried to 20 % WC. Under slight drying at a fast rate, seeds survived dehydration to 34 % WC (85 % germination). The ultrastructure of mature embryos indicated active metabolism and starch appears to be the main storage reserve. Drying to lower WC promoted abnormal appearance of cell walls, deformation of organelles and subcellular deterioration which was followed by an increase in electrical conductivity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a facultative, non-spore-forming, non-acid-fast, small, Gram-positive bacillus. The {{organism}} {{was first}} {{established as a}} human pathogen late in the nineteenth century. Three forms of human disease have been recognised since then. These include a localised cutaneous lesion form, erysipeloid, a generalised cutaneous form and a septicaemic form often associated with endocarditis. The organism is ubiquitous and able to persist {{for a long period}} of time in the environment, including marine locations. It is a pathogen or a commensal in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, birds and fish. Swine erysipelas caused by E. rhusiopathiae is the disease of greatest prevalence and <b>economic</b> <b>importance.</b> <b>Diseases</b> in other animals include erysipelas of farmed turkeys, chickens, ducks and emus, and polyarthritis in sheep and lambs. Infection due to E. rhusiopathiae in humans is occupationally related, principally occurring as a result of contact with contaminated animals, their products or wastes, or soil. Erysipeloid is the most common form of infections in humans. While it has been suggested that the incidence of human infection could be declining due to technological advances in animal industries, infection still occurs in specific environments. Additionally, infection by the organism is possibly under-diagnosed due to the resemblance it bears to other infections, and problems encountered in isolation and identification. Various virulence factors have been suggested as being involved in the pathogenicity of E. rhusiopathiae. The presence of a hyaluronidase and neuraminidase has been recognised, and it was shown that neuraminidase plays a significant role in bacterial attachment and subsequent invasion into host cells. The role of hyaluronidase in the disease process is controversial. The presence of a heat labile capsule has been reported as important in virulence. Control of animal disease by sound husbandry, herd management, good sanitation and immunization procedures is recommended...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest for important tree species conservation {{in the context of}} climate change, anthropogenic pressure and invasion of alien tree species. A key factor in the survival of trees is represented by the mycorrhizal association. The success of micropropagated trees also depends on the acquisition of mycorrhizal mutualists. Ectomycorrhizal roots samples from several Quercus species (Q. cerris, Q. frainetto, Q. robur) were examined for mycorrhizal morphotypes’ characterization. The samples were collected during the vegetation season from stands located in Southern and North-Western Romania. 30 morphotypes of active mycorrhizaewere identified with Cenococcum geophilum Fr.

Previous studies on somatic embryogenesis inQ. robur and Q. frainetto demonstrated the utility of in vitro techniques in obtaining plants from these recalcitrant seed producing species, considered at risk in various areas of the country, due to increasingly stressful conditions. The success rate of the acclimatization process depends on the mycorrhization performed either artificially, in the laboratory, either naturally, in the field.
