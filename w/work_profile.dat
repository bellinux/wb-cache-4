40|$|Computational {{studies of}} ligand–protein binding are crucial for {{properly}} designing novel compounds of potential pharmacological interest. In this respect, researchers are increasingly interested in steered molecular dynamics for ligand–protein binding and unbinding studies. In particular, {{it has been}} suggested that analyzing the <b>work</b> <b>profiles</b> along the ligand–protein undocking paths could be fruitful. Here, we propose that small portions of <b>work</b> <b>profiles,</b> termed “local mechanical responses” of the system to a steering force, could serve as a universal measure for capturing relevant information about the system under investigation. Specifically, we first collected a high number of steering trajectories using two biological systems of increasing complexity (i. e., alanine dipeptide and (R) -roscovitine/CDK 5 complex). Then, we devised a novel postprocessing tool to be applied to the local mechanical responses, to extract structural information related to the biological processes under investigation. Despite the out-of-equilibrium character of the trajectories, the analysis carried out on the <b>work</b> <b>profiles</b> provided pivotal information about the investigated biological processes. This could eventually be applied to drug design...|$|R

40|$|Fish eye STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, 2 -group comparison, {{experimental}} laboratory study. Fish eye OBJECTIVES: Examining {{and comparing}} the <b>work</b> <b>profiles</b> {{of the shoulder}} flexors and extensors between sport climbers and nonclimbers. Fish eye BACKGROUND: Sport climbing places high demands on the shoulder, {{which could lead to}} unique <b>work</b> <b>profiles</b> of the agonist/antagonist muscle groups. Fish eye METHODS AND MEASURES: Isokinetic work output of the dominant shoulder flexors and extensors of 31 sport climbers and 27 nonclimbers were measured from 0 ° to 180 ° of flexion at a test speed of 60 °/s. <b>Profiles</b> for <b>work</b> data (concentric flexion [conFlex], eccentric flexion [eccFlex], concentric extension [conExt], eccentric extension [eccExt]) normalized to body mass, conventional work ratios (conFlex/conExt and eccFlex/eccExt), and functional work ratios (eccFlex/conExt and eccExt/conFlex) were developed for both climbers and nonclimbers. Fish eye RESULTS: All <b>work</b> <b>profiles</b> were different between the 2 groups (P<. 001). All normalized work data were higher in climbers than nonclimbers, especially for conExt and eccExt. In the climbers, the conventional ratios were smaller than 1 for conFlex/conExt (0. 74) and eccFlex/eccExt (0. 74), whereas for the nonclimbers the ratios were 1. 13 and 1. 05, respectively. For the functional work data, the eccFlex/conExt ratio was 0. 9 for the climbers compared to 1. 46 for the nonclimbers. Conversely, the eccExt/conFlex ratio was much higher in the climbers (1. 73) compared to the nonclimbers (1. 28). Fish eye CONCLUSION: The differences in <b>work</b> <b>profiles</b> for the shoulder flexors and extensors between the climbers and nonclimbers suggest training-induced adaptations, stronger shoulder flexors, and, especially, stronger extensors, resulting from the sport of climbing.

The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine if personal values/value systems held by employees can be used to accurately assign them to levels of work to which they will be best suited and, by implication, are likely to perform well. To fulfil this purpose, data covering a biographically mixed sample (N= 399), being employees of various organisations was obtained by way of psychological assessment. Two psychological measures were used - one that measures employees' level of work profiles (CPP) and the other, their personal value systems (VO). Using correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis, the study finds a statistically significant association between an employee's value system and his/her level of <b>work</b> <b>profile</b> (p<. 05), and a moderate but also statistically significant ability of values to predict an employee's level of <b>work</b> <b>profile</b> (p<. 001). The study concludes by recommending that, as part of the many considerations that should be taken into account in pursuit of successful initial and subsequent placement of people in organisations, personal values held by employees should be one of the qualities to be assessed and taken into consideration. The study further notes that the consideration of employee value systems as a quality necessary for on-the-job success should be done in addition to, rather than in replacement of the traditionally preferred qualities of cognitive abilities, personality and acquired knowledge/skills...|$|E
