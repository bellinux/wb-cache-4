The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine, by means of a review of {{literature}} and empirical research, the impact of dietary interventions on the classroom health promotion of Foundation Phase learners <b>with</b> <b>ADD.</b> In order to reach this goal, it was imperative to illustrate the meaning of the concepts health, wellness, health promoting schools, nutrition and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). The objective of the empirical research was to determine whether dietary interventions would promote the health of Foundation Phase learners <b>with</b> <b>ADD</b> in the classroom by focusing on decreasing their levels of hyperactivity, increasing their concentration and improving their social behaviour. In conclusion, the following are some of the findings of this study. Dietary interventions impacted positively on: the hyperactivity level of participating foundation phase learners <b>with</b> <b>ADD</b> in the classroom; the ability of participating foundation phase learners <b>with</b> <b>ADD</b> to concentrate in the classroom; and the social behaviour of participating foundation phase learners <b>with</b> <b>ADD</b> in the classroom.

5|$|In 1978, {{expansion}} of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, <b>with</b> <b>added</b> parking, hotel expansion, {{and development of}} Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan {{was approved by the}} government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.|$|E

5|$|Of Human Feelings was {{recorded}} with a Sony PCM-1600 two-track digital recorder, a rare item at the time.

Because of the equipment used, Coleman did not embellish the album <b>with</b> <b>added</b> effects and avoided overdubbing, multi-tracking, and remixing. According to him, Of Human Feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, <b>with</b> <b>added</b> peat being helpful. They may {{be grown}} in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines <b>with</b> <b>added</b> herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E

40|$|A certain {{percentage}} of law students come with Attention Deficit Disorder (<b>ADD)</b> or <b>with</b> another learning disability, either disclosed or undisclosed. Yet {{there has been little}} empirical research on how law students with learning disabilities read and understand the law. This study examined how three law students <b>with</b> <b>ADD</b> read a judicial opinion. The results suggested a relationship between successful law school performance and the use of problematizing and rhetorical reading strategies; and less successful law school performance and the use of default reading strategies. Results suggest that law students <b>with</b> <b>ADD</b> can be successful and productive members of any law school community.

5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and <b>with</b> <b>added</b> tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
