She spills coffee on it and then lends Ed a nicer one that she found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul.

25|$|As the King {{gradually}} became permanently insane, the Queen's personality altered: she developed a terrible temper, sank into depression, no longer enjoyed appearing in public, not {{even at the}} musical concerts she had so loved, and her relationships with her adult children became strained. From 1792, she found some relief from her <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> husband by planning the gardens and decoration of a new residence for herself, Frogmore House, in Windsor Home Park.|$|E
25|$|She {{became a}} fan of hip hop music {{at the age of}} 14 and {{improved}} her English by listening and rapping along to famous American rappers such as Eminem. At the age of 15, she started hanging out with lots of bad guys, which made her parents <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and therefore always keep an eye on her. The reason she chose music to be her career is that it made her feel safe. She was also interested in skateboarding, and accepted the invitation to join a nu-metal band covering Linkin Park’s songs. She then quickly became a well-recognized and respected rapper from the Vietnamese underground scene.|$|E

25|$|Burnett {{returned}} to London in 1894; there she heard news that her younger son Vivian was ill, so she quickly {{went back to}} the United States. Vivian recovered from his illness, but missed his first term at Harvard University. Burnett stayed with him until he was well, then {{returned to}} London. At this time she began to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> finances: she was paying for Vivian's education; keeping a house in Washington D.C. (Swan had moved out of the house to his own apartment); and keeping a home in London. As she had in the past, she turned to writing as a source of income and began to write A Lady of Quality. A Lady of Quality, published in 1896, was to become {{the first of a series}} of successful adult historical novels, which was followed in 1899 with In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim; and in 1901 she had published The Making of a Marchioness and The Methods of Lady Walderhurst.|$|E
25|$|In 1685, {{his only}} {{surviving}} grandson, Louis de Bourbon, married Louise Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes - eldest surviving daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. In mid-1686, Louise Françoise (later {{better known as}} Madame la Duchesse) caught smallpox while at Fontainebleau; it was the Prince himself who helped nurse the little Duchess back to health, {{to the point of}} staying up with her to help her eat. The Prince even forcibly stopped Louis XIV himself from seeing his daughter for his own safety. Despite Louise Françoise surviving and giving her husband ten children, the Prince himself became ill; most said it was from <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> health. He himself died at the Palace of Fontainebleau. He was buried in the Église at Vallery, the traditional burial place of the Princes of Condé; Claire-Clémence, who outlived her husband, was buried at the Église Saint-Martin at the Château de Châteauroux, France in 1694.|$|E
500|$|During 2000, Hill {{dropped out}} of the public eye. The {{pressures}} of fame began to overwhelm her. She disliked not being able to go out of her house to do simple errands without having to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> physical appearance. She fired her management team and began attending Bible study classes five days a week; she also stopped doing interviews, watching television and listening to music. She started associating with a [...] "spiritual advisor" [...] named Brother Anthony. Some familiar with Hill believe Anthony more resembled a cult leader than a spiritual advisor, and thought his guidance probably inspired much of Hill's more controversial public behavior.|$|E

500|$|While John Brownlee relished life in Alberta, Florence {{missed her}} friends and family in Ontario. [...] Her own health was only made worse by <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> sons': John was perpetually nervous, and Alan was high-strung and sickly. [...] It did not help that, {{beginning}} in 1921, her husband spent the work week in Edmonton, commuting home to Calgary only for the weekends. [...] This situation continued until 1923, when {{the family moved to}} Edmonton's Garneau region. [...] In 1926, {{on the way home from}} a visit east, Florence Brownlee and her sons were examined at the Mayo Clinic, where all three were given clean bills of health; Florence in particular was advised to [...] "resume a more active life".|$|E
500|$|Amor Prohibido was {{recorded}} in its entirety at record producer Manny Guerra's studio in San Antonio, Texas and was engineered by house engineer Brian [...] "Red" [...] Moore. Pérez, wrote that the singer [...] "never complained about her mix or the sound onstage" [...] calling this [...] "rare" [...] among singers. He added that he never heard her say: [...] "I don't want to do that." [...] He said it was common for her {{to arrive at the}} studio during the album's production, [...] "hum her part a little", telling them not to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> because she will [...] "know what to do when [...] are ready to record", and then [...] "go off to shop at the mall." [...] Pérez said the band never [...] "had to ask [...] to change something in the studio" [...] as she [...] "track her vocals by herself, and she would be the one who would request a second take" [...] in order to [...] "add little harmonies she'd create" [...] during recording. Former keyboardist of the group, Rena Dearman provided several songs she wrote to A.B., who requested some material from her. A.B. favored [...] "I'll Be Alright" [...] and wanted Selena to record the song for Amor Prohibido, which was rejected by EMI Latin because [...] "it didn't fit the mood of the album." [...] for which A.B. later told her it could be included in Selena's next Tejano recording. The band's production sequence remain unchanged for Amor Prohibido. Selena and the band recorded their parts in the studio after they had first perfected them during pre-production. A.B. would then arrange and mix them. It took two weeks for Selena to record the album's ten tracks.|$|E

500|$|One {{day in the}} mid-1990s, Smith was at {{her home}} talking {{to one of her}} {{daughter}}s on the phone. After telling her mother {{what she was going to}} that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997), acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. Consisting of ten tracks, nine of them were co-written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music: The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded [...] "far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream". Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a solid effort", also commenting, [...] "...it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer." ...|$|E
