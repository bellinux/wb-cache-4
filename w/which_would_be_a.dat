5|$|As {{a form of}} Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents {{that stretch}} back to {{southern}} Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed {{in response to the}} development of scientific rationality. This new esoteric trend is termed occultism by scholars, and it was this occultism <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> key factor {{in the development of the}} worldview from which the New Age emerged.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E

5|$|The Dhaka–Chittagong Highway {{runs through}} Sitakunda, {{connecting}} {{the two largest}} cities in Bangladesh. A workshop conducted by Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that improving the highway would increase Bangladesh's GDP by 1% and its foreign trade by 20%. This roadlink between the two cities existed in the pre-railway days and {{has been identified as}} a part of the medieval southern Silk Road.

5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

5|$|The Kirk {{began to}} concern itself with {{providing}} {{churches in the}} new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Led by Thomas Chalmers, by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription. When the Great Disruption occurred in 1843, and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the Free Church of Scotland, Chalmers' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 new places of worship by 1847. The established church took time to recover, but embarked on a rival programme of church building, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909. The intense competition between different denominations {{led to the creation}} of grand churches with tall steeples and ultimately resulted in an oversupply of churches, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> financial burden to future generations.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of the}} Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail has a tiny global range with {{a single}} population. Though still common within its tiny range, with around 5,600 adult birds in the world, the species is {{considered}} to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach Inaccessible Island. Insular rails, particularly flightless species, are vulnerable to extinction. House mice, feral cats and brown rats, all of <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> serious threat to this species, are not present on the island, nor have they ever been, but are present on nearby Tristan da Cunha, and could reach the islands via fishing vessels or other boats visiting the island (mice have been found on boats visiting the neighbouring Nightingale Island). Because of this vulnerability, this species is rated as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Fires of tussock grass, which were recorded in 1872 and 1909, are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails, but have not occurred since. In the 1950s they were highly sought after for scientific collections, but permits to do so were rarely granted.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Wake Forest {{kicked off}} {{to begin the}} game, and Georgia Tech {{returned}} the kick to its own 24-yard line. On the first play of the game, Tech running back Tashard Choice attempted a rush, but was stopped for a loss of one yard. The play {{set the tone for}} the rest of the game, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hard-fought, low-scoring defensive struggle. After the loss, Choice broke free on the second play of the game for a 24-yard run and a first down. On the next two plays, the Georgia Tech offense used their passing attack as quarterback Reggie Ball completed two passes, driving the Yellowjackets into Wake Forest territory. Subsequent plays allowed Tech to penetrate the Wake Forest red zone, but there, the Demon Deacons' defense stiffened. Despite having a first down inside the Wake Forest 10-yard line, Georgia Tech did not cross the goal line. Denied a touchdown, Georgia Tech was forced to settle for a field goal attempt from kicker Travis Bell. Bell's kick was good, and with 9:59 remaining in the first quarter, Georgia Tech took a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of unbinilium {{is predicted to}} be {{similar to that of the}} alkaline earth metals, but it would probably behave more like calcium or strontium than barium or radium. Like strontium, unbinilium should react vigorously with air to form an oxide (UbnO) and with water to form the hydroxide (Ubn(OH)2), <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strong base, and releasing hydrogen gas. It should also react with the halogens to form salts such as UbnCl2. While these reactions would be expected from periodic trends, their lowered intensity is somewhat unusual, as ignoring relativistic effects, periodic trends would predict unbinilium to be even more reactive than barium or radium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of unbinilium's valence electron, increasing unbinilium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for radium. the {{chemistry of}} unbinilium in the +2 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of strontium than to that of radium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Sr2+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Unbinilium may also show the +4 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkaline earth metal, in addition to the +2 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkaline earth metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkaline earth metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. The +1 state may also be stable in isolation. Many unbinilium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in radium, which shows some 6s and 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in radium fluoride (RaF2) and astatide (RaAt2), resulting in these compounds having more covalent character. The standard reduction potential of the Ubn2+/Ubn couple is predicted to be −2.9V.|$|E
