500|$|Luke Butcher {{noted that}} Ingels taps into metamodern sensibility, {{adopting}} a metamodern attitude; but he [...] "seems to oscillate between modern positions and postmodern ones, a certain out-of-this-worldness and a definite down-to-earthness, naivety and knowingness, idealism and the practical." [...] Sustainable development {{and renewable energy}} are important to Ingels, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "hedonistic sustainability". He has said that [...] "It's not about what <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> to be sustainable, it's about what we get. And that is a very attractive and marketable concept." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they worked}} with Steinbeck, Rodgers and Hammerstein, though renowned for such hits as Oklahoma!, Carousel, and South Pacific, {{suffered}} a relative failure with the 1953 musical Me and Juliet, {{a tale of}} romance among the cast and stagehands backstage at a musical. Before agreeing to do the Sweet Thursday project, the duo had considered other projects for their next work together, such as an adaptation of the film Saratoga Trunk. A proposal made by attorney David Merrick to adapt a series of works by Marcel Pagnol to which Merrick held the stage rights fell through when the duo were not willing to have Merrick be an associate producer; Merrick took the project elsewhere, and it was developed into the hit Fanny. Afterwards, Hammerstein stated, [...] "Why the hell did <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> Fanny? What on earth were we trying to prove? My God, that's a great story and {{look at some of}} the junk we've done!" ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E

The simplest solutions, [...] or [...] both yield the trivial wavefunction , which describes a particle that does not exist anywhere in the system. [...] Negative values of [...] are neglected, since they give wavefunctions identical to the positive [...] solutions except for a physically unimportant sign change. Here one sees that only a discrete set of energy values and wavenumbers k are allowed for the particle. Usually in quantum mechanics it is also demanded that the derivative of the wavefunction {{in addition to the}} wavefunction itself be continuous; here this demand would lead to the only solution being the constant zero function, which is not what we desire, so <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> this demand (as this system with infinite potential can be regarded as a nonphysical abstract limiting case, we can treat it as such and [...] "bend the rules"). Note that giving up this demand means that the wavefunction is not a differentiable function at the boundary of the box, and thus {{it can be said that}} the wavefunction does not solve the Schr√∂dinger equation at the boundary points [...] and [...] (but does solve everywhere else).|$|E
