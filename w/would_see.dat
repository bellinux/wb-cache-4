5|$|As of 2016, {{only three}} {{buildings}} from the 1960 Winter Olympics remain in Squaw Valley. An {{expansion of the}} resort's village, currently in the planning stages, <b>would</b> <b>see</b> two of these buildings demolished.|$|E
5|$|Candide, the impressionable and incompetent {{student of}} Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and {{eventually}} despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire <b>would</b> <b>see</b> it) of his optimism.|$|E
500|$|Written by James Moran. A story idea {{considered}} for the second series, it <b>would</b> <b>seen</b> Toshiko having to cope {{without the use of}} gadgets or weaponry.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Radio-Québec and TVOntario {{signed an}} {{exchange}} arrangement, in which English-language TVO programming <b>would</b> be <b>seen</b> on Radio-Québec, and Radio-Québec's French-language programming <b>would</b> be <b>seen</b> on TVO.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had {{you come}} a day sooner, Tuan, you <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> an enemy die. You <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> him die poor, blind, unhappy--with no son to dig his grave and speak of his wisdom and courage. Yes; you <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> {{the man that}} fought you in Carimata many years ago, die alone--but for one friend. A great sight to you." ...|$|R
5|$|If the Universe were {{contracting}} {{instead of}} expanding, we <b>would</b> <b>see</b> distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted.|$|E
5|$|In August 1910 Lenin {{attended}} the 8th Congress of the Second International in Copenhagen, where he represented the RSDLP on the International Bureau, {{before going to}} Stockholm, where he holidayed with his mother; {{the last time that}} he <b>would</b> <b>see</b> her alive.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the season}} starting, the WRC {{predicted}} that the season <b>would</b> <b>see</b> six named storms, with three of those becoming a hurricane while no forecast was made on the numbers of major hurricanes.|$|E
500|$|Written by James Moran. A story idea {{considered}} for the second series, it <b>would</b> <b>seen</b> a group of Neo Nazis targeting ethnic minorities with an alien weapon that caused the victims to lose all their bones.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this was}} the last time Barlow and Watt <b>would</b> be <b>seen</b> {{together}} on British TV (and the last time Barlow <b>would</b> be <b>seen</b> at all), the Watt character would make one final appearance, in the last episode of Z-Cars in September 1978.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fool!--and slow {{of heart}} to believe! Where else <b>would</b> you <b>see</b> Him but in {{yourself}} {{and in the}} world? They are all things cognisable to you. Where else, but everywhere, <b>would</b> you <b>see</b> Him whom no man hath seen, or can see?' ...|$|R
5|$|A crucial goal against Espanyol and a brace against Sevilla {{helped him}} reach 16 goals that season and <b>would</b> <b>see</b> him come sixth in La Liga's top scorer list that season (scoring {{the same amount}} of goals as fellow {{international}} Raúl Tamudo) while he created more assists than anyone.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{improvement}} works {{are planned for}} Tonkin Highway, which will see most of the central and northern sections upgraded to a freeway-standard road with grade separated interchanges. Extensions are also planned {{at both ends of}} the highway, which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the southern end extended to South Western Highway south of Byford, and link the northern end to the future Perth Darwin National Highway near Ballajura.|$|E
5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E
60|$|If he {{had been}} looking at her, which at that moment he was not, Harold <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> her stagger and catch at the wall for support. Then he <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> an awful and malevolent light of sudden {{determination}} pass across her face.|$|R
50|$|The same <b>would</b> be <b>see</b> for 1,2-Dichloroethene.|$|R
50|$|Phase Two <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> the westwards {{extension}} of the shopping centre towards Irvine Railway Station. Phase Three <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> {{the replacement of the}} Railway Station. Phase Four would have entailed the demolition of the surviving half of Montgomery Street to permit the shopping centre to connect with the Magnum.|$|R
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping that someone <b>would</b> <b>see</b> them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It is still there today, though no longer in use.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Sinatra {{returned}} to Capitol Records and {{the recording studio}} for Duets, which became his best-selling album. The album and its sequel, Duets II, released the following year, <b>would</b> <b>see</b> Sinatra remake his classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their vocals to a pre-recorded tape.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me go--let me go!' {{she only}} repeated, with her high, quavering, distracted note; {{and as he}} moved a little she got the door open. But he {{followed}} her out: <b>would</b> she <b>see</b> him that night? Where was she going? might he not go with her? <b>would</b> she <b>see</b> him to-morrow? ...|$|R
25|$|The {{commander}} position <b>would</b> be <b>seen</b> {{again in}} Battlefield 2142 and Battlefield 4.|$|R
5000|$|The {{old system}} <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> A Dublin vs Mayo All Ireland semi-final.|$|R
5|$|In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation {{of local}} {{government}} in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two county boroughs (Belfast and Derry) by 26 single-tier districts, which, apart from Fermanagh cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as Lieutenancy. In November 2005, proposals were announced which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the number of local authorities reduced to seven.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{some of the}} CRG {{radicals}} including Wang Li and Guan Feng {{were arrested}} on the orders of Mao, {{but by the end}} of the Cultural Revolution the new drive to eradicate 'ultra-leftists' <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the arrest of nearly all of the CRG's members (Jiang Qing would survive until the death of Mao).|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day the Red Sox won Game 3, The Boston Globes Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought the Red Sox on the verge of winning a World Series, he {{wondered}} how many people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox and hoping that one day, they <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E

50|$|Hans von Tschammer und Osten, however, <b>would</b> never <b>see</b> {{the end of}} the {{organization}} he had led for so long. He also <b>would</b> never <b>see</b> Germany losing World War II, for he died from pneumonia in Berlin in 1943. The assets he left behind were negligible for a man of his position. Von Tschammer was succeeded as Reichssportführer by Arno Breitmeyer.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifty years the {{division}} <b>would</b> <b>see</b> numerous changes to its structure as its training roles changed and subordinate units shifted {{in and out}} of its command. It activated a large number of regimental and brigade commands to fulfill various training roles. The division then began conducting one station unit training, a responsibility it continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|The Komnenian {{period was}} {{followed}} by the dynasty of the Angeloi, who oversaw perhaps the most crucial period in the Decline of the Byzantine Empire. The next quarter of a century <b>would</b> <b>see</b> Constantinople fall to an invading force {{for the first time in}} its history, and the final loss of the empire's 'great power' status. However, with the death of Andronikos, the Komnenian dynasty, having lasted 104 years, had finally come to an end.|$|E
5|$|The M32 forms a {{bottleneck}} at {{its northern}} end {{as it is}} the only link between the M4 and the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. In 2015, Chris Skidmore, Member of Parliament for Kingswood, launched the Gateway2Growth campaign, which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> a new road running from the M4 at Emersons Green to the A4174.|$|E
50|$|The Seaforths {{however as}} part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division <b>would</b> not <b>see</b> combat until July 1943 in Operation Husky, the {{invasion}} of Sicily. The beach landing was relatively uneventful but the Seaforths <b>would</b> soon <b>see</b> hard battles as they fought veteran German units for hilltop town after hilltop town through Valguarnera, Leonforte, Nissoria, Agira and Regalbuto, to Adrano.|$|R
50|$|Ravindra Jain, in an {{interview}} wherein the blind music director confessed that if ever he happened to regain vision, the first person he <b>would</b> like to <b>see</b> <b>would</b> be Yesudas.|$|R
