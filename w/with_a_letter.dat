5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, and his or her performance is rated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy.
