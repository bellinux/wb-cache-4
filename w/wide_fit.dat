50|$|Dunlop {{exported}} {{on average}} over 120,000 pairs of KT26 shoes to Papua New Guinea per year. Dunlop KT26s have become ubiquitous fashion items within rugged countries {{where they are}} prized for their low cost, <b>wide</b> <b>fit,</b> sturdy construction and superior tread pattern. The shoe's tread pattern is particularly useful in muddy conditions, which has helped it to become the footwear of choice for competitors in the Kokoda Challenge, a race over {{the length of the}} Kokoda Track. It is reported that there are over 23 counterfeit versions of KT26 on sale in Papua New Guinea.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, {{the term}} [...] "carryall" [...] is often {{also used to}} refer to a type of sleigh. It is about 4 m (13 ft) long and 0.5 m (1.5 ft) <b>wide,</b> <b>fitted</b> with a canvas or hide container. It is pulled by dogs or a snowmobile. It is used principally by trappers and hunters to {{transport}} people and goods.|$|R
500|$|When {{completed}} in 1766, Edwards' Grand Sluice {{consisted of three}} channels each [...] <b>wide,</b> <b>fitted</b> with pointed gates on both sides, and a lock adjacent to the north bank, {{which could be used}} as an additional flood relief channel if required. The lock was originally very small, but was lengthened to its current [...] in 1881. The pointed doors on the non-tidal side of the sluice were replaced by steel guillotine gates between 1979 and 1982.|$|R
25|$|In 1930 {{the design}} was refined as the Yakovlev AIR-4 {{with a new}} split-axle landing gear, <b>wider</b> cockpits <b>fitted</b> with {{entrance}} doors and extra fuel.|$|R
50|$|All the {{original}} passenger carriages (built 1911-1922) were about 58 ft long, 9 ft <b>wide</b> and <b>fitted</b> with clerestory roofs. The fifteen 1925 cars {{were the same}} dimensions but with curved roofs.|$|R
50|$|Its {{function}} in modern woodworking {{has been largely}} replaced by power tools such as the thickness planer. A scrub plane can still be useful for planing boards too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> through a thickness planer.|$|R
50|$|The 8-car CRH3C {{trains are}} similar to the Velaro E design in Spain, but 300 mm <b>wider</b> to <b>fit</b> more seats in a 2+3 layout; a 200 m CRH3 train will seat 548 passengers: 16 deluxe-class (8 sold publicly), 50 in first-class, 490 in second-class.|$|R
60|$|The stage, methinks, {{perhaps is}} none too <b>wide,</b> And hardly <b>fit</b> for royal Richard's stride, Or Falstaff's bulk, or Denmark's {{youthful}} pride.|$|R
50|$|It was {{discovered}} that the ship was too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> through the lock at Hull so she did not serve the routes from that port as intended. She was briefly used on a re-established Dover-Zeebrugge route but the service only lasted for one day {{due to lack of}} freight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next-generation}} (CD) Accord grew in size considerably, {{mostly to}} satisfy North American market efforts, and thus became too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> within the favorable Japanese tax class. Therefore, Honda needed a slightly smaller compact sedan {{to cater to}} the JDM market, and this duty {{was assigned to the}} new Ascot ...|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} from residents of Newcastle-under-Lyme after the council spent £2.4 million {{to improve its}} recycling in the borough, however the fleet of new vehicles are too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> down some narrow roads. This has left some residents going {{for up to a}} fortnight without any waste collection service.|$|R
500|$|Motoring {{journalists have}} been {{critical}} of its size, being too big for a two-seater with virtually no luggage space, too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> through traffic restrictors or to drive comfortably on most roads. The very heavy unassisted steering and pedals, underwhelming brakes without ABS, poor directional stability and [...] "terrible visibility" [...] were also disliked.|$|R
50|$|If any {{content is}} too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> on a display, {{horizontal}} scrolling {{is required to}} view all of it. In applications such as graphics and spreadsheets there is often more content than can fit either the width or {{the height of the}} screen at a comfortable scale, and scrolling in both directions is necessary.|$|R
50|$|The company Aveling & Porter was {{the first}} to {{successfully}} sell the product commercially. In 1866 they produced a prototype roller with 3 foot <b>wide</b> rollers <b>fitted</b> to the rear of a standard 12 nominal horsepower traction engine. This experimental machine was described by local papers as 'the world's first steamroller' and it caused a public spectacle.|$|R

50|$|Action Replay/Gameshark: Most {{models of}} the Action Replay or Gameshark for the GBA or GBC are too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> into the GBPs {{cartridge}} slot and often curl underneath the Game Boy Player system. One can overcome this problem by either modifying the device or simply through use of a ledge or propping up the system an inch. Despite these problems, most common Action Replay and Gameshark devices will work normally.|$|R
50|$|RC/MC: {{these models}} have a 28 cm <b>wide</b> blade that <b>fit</b> any lawn {{of up to}} 1200m2. They can be {{installed}} outside of the lawn for not interrupting with the normal use of the lawn.|$|R
5000|$|... "ROckWrok" [...] was, as mentioned, {{the lead}} single. An unusually sensual paean to {{unrestrained}} sexuality, the song featured a chorus which began [...] "come on, let's tangle in the dark/fuck like a dog, bite like a shark" [...] and lyrics such as [...] "the whole <b>wide</b> world <b>fits</b> hip to hip" [...] - despite which, it apparently achieved airplay on BBC Radio 1 {{on account of}} Foxx's garbled vocal delivery and the song's punky guitars.|$|R
5000|$|The TR4 was {{originally}} fitted with 15x4.5" [...] disc wheels. Optional 48-lace wire wheels could be ordered painted the same colour as the car's bodywork (rare), stove-enamelled (matte silver with chrome spinners, most common) or in matte or polished chrome finishes (originally rare, but now more commonly fitted). The most typical tyres originally fitted were 590-15 bias ply or optional radial tyres. In the US at one point, American Racing alloy (magnesium and aluminium) wheels were offered as an option, in 15x5.5" [...] or 15x6" [...] size. Tyres were {{a problem for}} original owners who opted for 60-spoke wire wheels, as the correct size radial-ply tyre for the factory rims was 155-15, an odd-sized tyre at the time only available from Michelin at considerable expense. Some original TR4 sales literature says the original radial size was 165-15. The much more common 185-15 radials were too <b>wide</b> to be <b>fitted</b> safely. As a result, many owners had new and <b>wider</b> rims <b>fitted</b> and their wheels re-laced.|$|R
50|$|Outside Scotland {{the term}} breeks {{is often used}} to refer to breeches, a trouser similar to plus fours, {{especially}} when worn in Scotland and engaging in field sports such as deer stalking, and the activities of taking pheasant, duck, partridge and other game birds. Whilst breeks are a neater, trimmer fit, plus twos are slightly wider with an extra 2 inches of material to fold over the knee, and plus fours a further 4 inches of material(and a <b>wider,</b> baggier <b>fit).</b>|$|R
50|$|Velaro CRH3C is a Chinese {{version of}} the Velaro. In November 2005, China ordered 60 trains for the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway. The eight-car trains {{are very similar to}} Spain's Velaro E, but 300 mm <b>wider</b> to <b>fit</b> in almost 50% more seats in a 2 plus 3 layout. In the CRH3C version, a 200-metre-long Velaro train will seat 600 passengers. These trains were {{manufactured}} jointly by Siemens in Germany and CNR Tangshan in China. The first Chinese-built CRH3C was unveiled on 11 April 2008.|$|R
50|$|The cap is of a {{truncated}} cone shape and {{is covered by}} thatch. The mill has four common sails and is winded by a tailpole. The four, modern, common sails follow the Dutch tradition, as there was no surviving sail to copy when Bremer restored the mill in 1935. Those fitted at the 1935 restoration were 6.00 m long and 1.75 m <b>wide,</b> <b>fitted</b> with a windboard on the leading edge. Such a feature {{was not to be}} found on other South African windmills. The sails, which have a span of 14.45 m, were carried on a teak windshaft. This was fitted with a cast iron poll end in 1935, because the terminus of the wooden shaft has rotted. Contemporary South African windmills all had wooden windshafts, apart from one of the Salt River windmills, which had an iron cross. A replacement windshaft made of iroko was fitted in 1995. The windshaft carries a clasp arm brake wheel, which has a diameter of 770 mm and has 47 cogs. It drove the single pair of millstones, via a lantern pinion stone nut, which has 16 staves. The millstones comprise the original runner stone and a non-original bedstone. The latter is a Cullen stone installed in 1935 and came from a windmill at Leens, Groningen, Netherlands.|$|R

50|$|The CAC {{appealed from}} a High Court {{decision}} {{that it had}} drawn {{the size of the}} bargaining unit incorrectly. The Transport and General Workers Union argued that the bargaining unit should be two separate units in London, under TULRCA 1992, Schedule A1 para 11(2), that the CAC should determine ‘whether the proposed bargaining unit is appropriate or some other bargaining unit is appropriate’. Kwik Fit argued that the bargaining unit should be company <b>wide.</b> Kwik <b>Fit</b> complained under Schedule A1 para 19B that the bargaining unit, if confined to the M25, would make management difficult.|$|R
50|$|The Z {{sets were}} {{gradually}} dissolved from the mid-90's, and the cars reallocated to N carriage sets. From 1995-1998 eight cars {{were converted to}} BZN, with some seats removed and a <b>wider</b> doorway <b>fitted</b> to make the cars wheelchair-accessible; and in 1998-1999 a further three cars were converted to a more dense seating arrangement, with 88 seats provided in the same layout as the BN carriages. A further three cars of each type were created in 2003, followed by 252 and 267 to BZN in 2007, 262 in 2008 and 259 in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Many modern tankers are too <b>wide</b> to <b>fit</b> {{through the}} Panama Canal, as {{are a few}} {{passenger}} ships and several aircraft carriers. But there are no regular commercial routes around the Horn, and modern ships carrying cargo are rarely seen. However, a number of cruise ships routinely round the Horn when traveling from one ocean to the other. [...] These often stop in Ushuaia or Punta Arenas as well as Port Stanley. Some of the small passenger vessels shuttling between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula will pass the Horn too, time and weather permitting.|$|R
