5|$|The Orangi Pilot Project <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Comilla Academy. OPP was {{a private}} body, {{dependent}} for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources {{and support of the}} government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, {{wondering}} if {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and {{was shocked by the}} news of a military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E

5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that walked on the sea-floor, Marella <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) {{in the structure of}} its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E

25|$|From 1920 to 1955 only AFL-affiliated unions were {{represented}} by the SCLC. During this phase there was a considerable conservative influence from Dave Beck, a prominent Teamster on the West Coast and eventual President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). Although he was instrumental in rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle, his conservative business unionism approach <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Council’s previous radical ideologies.|$|E

25|$|Eather's force now {{began to}} push the Japanese back over the mountains, but slowly. On 27 October, General Sir Thomas Blamey {{relieved}} Allen, replacing him with Major General George Alan Vasey, an officer that Eather distrusted, holding him responsible {{for the destruction of}} the 2/1st on Crete. In November, the 25th Infantry Brigade engaged the Japanese in the Battle of Oivi-Gorari. This time the outcome <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Ioribaiwa, and Eather won an important victory at low cost.|$|E
25|$|As Joseph E. Inikori argues, {{the history}} of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious. He argues that the African {{economic}} model of the period <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the European model, and could not sustain such population losses. Population reductions in certain areas also led to widespread problems. Inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade Africa's population almost immediately began to rapidly increase, even prior to the introduction of modern medicines.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} interglacial {{period and the}} most recent {{glaciation}} of the Pleistocene (from 131,000 till 12,000 BP), Europe <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Balkans. The glaciations did not affect southeastern Europe {{to the extent that they}} did in the northern and central regions. The evidence of forest and steppe indicate the influence was not so drastic; some species of flora and fauna survived only in the Balkans. The Balkans today still abound in species endemic only to this part of Europe.|$|E

Second-year French star Tony Parker, drafted by the Spurs {{in the first round}} of the 2001 NBA draft, was now the {{starting}} point guard for the Spurs. The squad featured a variety of newly acquired three-point shooters, including Stephen Jackson, Danny Ferry, Bruce Bowen, Steve Kerr, Steve Smith and Argentine product Manu Ginóbili, a 1999 second-round draft choice playing in his first NBA season.|$|E
25|$|Since {{entering}} the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> anything Deere had built before. The {{new line of}} four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.|$|E
25|$|Dr Krapf {{also noted}} that the rivers flowing from Mt Kenya, and other {{mountains}} in the area, were continuously flowing. This <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other rivers in the area, which swelled up in the wet season and completely dried up after the rainy season had ended. As the streams flowed even in the driest seasons he concluded that there must be a source of water up on the mountain, in the form of glaciers. He believed the mountain to be the source of the White Nile.|$|E

Previous to the deals with the DEA the two had, he said, already sold it to one gullible buyer and that he solicited the agents in order to make more money. At no time had he ever believed the two were actually selling heroin, he claimed. He raised the entrapment defense but proposed an alternate to the standard entrapment instruction.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of Eanna in period III <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what had preceded it. The complex of monumental temples {{was replaced with}} baths around the Great Courtyard and the labyrinthine Rammed-Earth Building. This period corresponds to Early Dynastic Sumer c 2900BC, {{a time of great}} social upheaval when the dominance of Uruk was eclipsed by competing city-states. The fortress-like {{architecture of}} this time is a reflection of that turmoil. The temple of Inanna continued functioning during this time in a new form and under a new name, 'The House of Inanna in Uruk' (Sumerian: e2-dinanna unuki-ga). The location of this structure is currently unknown.|$|E
25|$|Through this time, Raskin {{continually}} wrote memos {{about how}} the personal computer could become a true consumer appliance. While the Apple III was under development in 1978 and '79, Raskin was lobbying for Apple to create a radically different kind of computer that was designed from the start {{to be easy to}} use. In Computers by the Millions, he stated that expandable computers like the Apple II were too complex, and development was difficult due to the unknown nature of the machine the program ran on. The machine he envisioned <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Macintosh that was eventually released and had much more in common with PDAs than modern desktop-based machines.|$|E
