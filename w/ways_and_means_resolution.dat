State Secretary Otto Vierling delivered a keynote report to the gathering <b>and</b> committees on <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means,</b> Platform <b>and</b> <b>Resolutions,</b> and Constitution were elected. A state platform was passed, Presidential electors chosen, and resolutions passed, including a call for creation of a state Domestic Relations Commission patterned after a similar institution established in Chicago in 1911. This institution was to attempt to reconcile couples threatening divorce, and in the event this was unsuccessful, {{to report to the}} court factually on the situation so that a remedy could be achieved [...] "without the interference of a lawyer." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a study of Diaspora's {{engagement}} with the media, especially that of 'conflict-generated Diasporas' is imperative to understand {{the dynamics of the}} conflict in the homeland in order to devise <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> for conflict <b>resolution.</b> In the light of arguments that Diasporas often contribute to the prolonging and sustenance of a conflict, the paper takes up the example of the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora in Australia and makes a case for exploring the members' engagement with media, particularly online media, to understand the dynamics and the trajectory of the conflict. This is significant, firstly, {{in the context of the}} Sri Lankan Diaspora's role in the two-decade-long civil strife in Sri Lanka that is currently poised to enter another phase, 1 and secondly in the context of websites having been and continuing to be one of the most sought after sources of information on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue.

50|$|The Committee of <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> was {{abolished}} in 1967 and {{the responsibility}} for all fiscal matters, including taxation, now rests with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Traditionally, the title of Chairman of <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> is conferred on the Deputy Speaker of the House. It was formerly an appointed position resulting from a motion tabled {{at the beginning of each}} Parliament by the Leader of the House. Following the 6 May 2010 General Election, the Chairman of <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> <b>and</b> his two deputies were elected by ballot.
