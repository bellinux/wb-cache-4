The {{development}} of heat treatment modes of <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> for structure {{changes in their}} eutectic constituent, namely in disturbing the monolithic structure of ledeburite colonies cementite structure and eutectic net continuity. Also the mentioned heat treatment modes are targeted to the eutectic net shift for the most suitable position {{from the point of}} plastic deforming. Methodology. The hypoeutectic <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> with 2. 92 … 3. 35 % carbon content and additionally alloyed by 3. 18 % vanadium have been used as the research materials. The mentioned alloys have been pre-heat treated and hot twist tested. Findings. The research results showed that the carbide net breaking by plastic deforming leads to <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> mechanical properties increasing but has difficulties in implementation due to the <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> low plasticity. The influence of different pre-heat treatment modes on structure and plasticity of <b>white</b> hypoeutectic <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> have been investigated. They include the isotherm soaking under the different temperatures as well as multiply soakings and thermo-cycling. The influence of eutectic level, as well as pre heat treatment modes on different composition <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> hot plasticity have been investigated. Originality. It was determined that the heat treatment, which leads to double α→γ recrystallization under 860 – 950 °С and reperlitization under 720 - 680 °С results in significant increase of plasticity, as well as in un-alloyed and alloyed by vanadium <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> It takes place due to carbide matrix phase separation in ledeburite colonies by new phase boundaries forming especially due to carbide transformations under vanadium alloying. Practical value. The implementation of pre-heat treatment with phase recrystallization resulted in hypoeutectic <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> plasticity increasing. The obtained level of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> plasticity corresponds to the one of carbide class steels, which ensures the successful deformation by forging and rolling...|$|R

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to cool thick castings fast enough to solidify the melt as <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> all the way through. However, rapid cooling {{can be used to}} solidify a shell of <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> after which the remainder cools more slowly to form a core of grey cast iron. The resulting casting, called a chilled casting, has the benefits of a hard surface with a somewhat tougher interior.|$|E
50|$|Heating <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> above 727 C {{causes the}} {{formation}} of austenite in crystals of primary cementite. This austenisation of white iron occurs in primary cementite at the interphase boundary with ferrite. When the grains of austenite form in cementite, they occur as lamellar clusters oriented along the cementite crystal layer surface. Austenite is formed by diffusion of carbon atoms from cementite into ferrite.|$|E

40|$|As modern {{production}} {{moves towards}} higher efficiency and cost effectiveness, machining difficult-to-cut materials becomes an increasing challenge. Quickly and reliably characterizing {{the properties of}} materials could significantly improve the performance of machining processes {{in terms of their}} efficiency and production cost. This dissertation deals with the methodology for characterizing the micro-mechanical properties of high-chromium <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> – typical difficult-to-cut materials – and for experimentally assessing the machining performance of these materials. The hardness distribution and corresponding volume fractions were identified using grid nanoindentation techniques. The test results suggest that the hardness of high-chromium <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> can be broadly distributed depending on their composition and the heat treatment applied to them. The hardness distribution of as-cast materials can be highly skewed, and the Weibull mixture model has goodness-of-fit with lower fitting error than does the Gaussian model, although small {{differences were found between the}} Weibull and Gaussian models for the annealed and hardened sample materials. The variation in the indentation modulus between the materials can be adequately described by a Gaussian mixture model. The volume fractions of the individual phases before and after heat treatment can be successfully determined using statistical nanoindentation analysis. The results indicate good representation of the actual microstructure and phase distribution relative to the SEM images, as verified by the quite similar values obtained using empirical formula calculations. Statistical analysis of the grid nanoindentation measurements confirms that the bulk mechanical properties of the high-chromium <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> before and after heat treatment were determined by the phase mechanical properties and their corresponding volume fractions, especially in the case of phases in the matrix of the materials. The machinability of high-chromium <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is substantially influenced by both their micro-scale mechanical properties and abrasiveness. The abrasiveness of the materials is strongly correlated with the hardness differences between the phases of the materials, the volume fractions of the phases of the materials, and the morphology of the harder phases, such as carbides. The appearance of the cutting edge of the cBN tool after the machining tests suggests that abrasion wear and edge chipping are the main wear modes when machining high-chromium <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> Variations in the microhardness and microstructure of the test materials significantly influence the tool wear mechanism, although lower bulk hardness was measured in the test materials. The greater the variation in microhardness in the materials, the more the abrasion wear of the cutting tool is promoted. Severe chipping of the cutting edge could result from the presence of relatively large carbide grains in the work materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the impact toughness and stress-induced martensitic transformation, which occurs during the impact process, has been studied in <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and an Fe-Ni-C alloy at different temperatures. The experimental results have shown that in the brittle <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons,</b> the stress-induced martensitic transformation makes a positive contribution to the impact toughness, and lowering the stability of austenite increases the toughness. In contrast, the transformation makes a negative contribution to the toughness of high-carbon austenitic steels, and lowering the stability of austenite decreases the toughness. The present work supports the early theory([1]) that {{the magnitude of the}} toughness change depends on the fracture properties of the new phase and the energy being dissipated during the transformation process. Using the crystallographic model for the stress-induced martensitic transformation, which was originally developed in ceramics and was then refined and extended to irons and steels, the effect of the stress-induced martensitic transformation on the impact toughness can be predicted...|$|R

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{displays}} white fractured surfaces due to {{the presence}} of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|E
5000|$|Cast iron is a {{group of}} iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2%. Its {{usefulness}} derives from its relatively low melting temperature. The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured: <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through, grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks, and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite [...] "nodules" [...] which stop the crack from further progressing.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{materials}} {{have been evaluated}} to determine their erosion resistance for fossil energy applications. This {{is part of a}} larger program to study wear and corrosion at Albany Research Center. This paper will present the results for some of these materials, including FeAl, FeAl cermets, WC-Co cemented carbides, Si 3 N 4 -MoSi 2, Si 3 N 4, Stellite 6 B, <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and 440 C steel. Trends in erosion rates due to material properties and erosive conditions will be presented. FeAl cermets performed well compared to the WC-Co cemented carbides. The interparticle spacing of the WC-Co cemented carbides correlated with the erosion rate. The erosion rate of the WC-Co cemented carbides decreased as the interparticle spacing decreased. It is important to realize that erosion resistance is not an intrinsic material property, but is a system response. A change in the wear environment can significantly alter the relative rankings of materials with respect to their wear rate. For example, at relatively low velocities, the carbides in the <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> are more erosion resistant than the matrix, while at higher velocities the matrix is more erosion resistant...|$|R
40|$|Different {{abrasive}} wear tests {{have been applied}} to materials with hardnesses ranging from 80 HV (aluminium) to 1700 HV (tungsten carbide). The tests were: dry sand rubber wheel (DSRbrW); a similar test using a steel wheel (DSStlW); a new combined impact-abrasion test (FIA). The DSRbrW results were as expected, giving generally decreasing wear with increasing hardness. <b>White</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and tool steels containing coarse, hard carbide particles performed better than more homogeneous materials of comparable hardness. When normalized to load and distance, the DSStlW results for the homogeneous materials were similar to the DSRbrW results. The multi-phase materials performed poorly in the DSStIW test, with volume loss for high-speed steel (880 HV) {{higher than that of}} aluminium. Within this group, wear increased with increasing hardness. These unexpected results are explained in terms of (a) differential friction coefficients of wheel and specimen, (b) increased fracture of sand, and (c) introduction of microfracture wear mechanisms. The FIA combined impact-abrasion results lacked clear correlations with hardness. The span of relative wear rates was similar to that reported for materials in ball mills. <b>White</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> at maximum hardness performed fairly poorly and showed evidence of microfracture...|$|R
5000|$|In the iron-carbon system (i.e. plain-carbon steels {{and cast}} irons) it {{is a common}} {{constituent}} because ferrite can contain at most 0.02wt% of uncombined carbon.

Henry Cort's original puddling process only worked where the raw material was <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> rather than the grey pig iron that was the usual raw material for finery forges. To use grey pig iron, a preliminary refining process was necessary to remove silicon. The pig iron was melted in a running out furnace and then run out into a trough.

50|$|Either <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> or refined iron is {{then placed}} in hearth of the furnace, {{a process known}} as charging. For wet puddling, scrap iron and/or iron oxide is also charged. This mixture is then heated until the top melts, {{allowing}} for the oxides to begin mixing; this usually takes 30 minutes. This mixture is subjected to a strong current of air and stirred by long bars with hooks on one end, called puddling bars or rabbles, through doors in the furnace. This helps the oxygen from the oxides to react with impurities in the pig iron, notably silicon, manganese (to form slag) and to some degree sulfur and phosphorus, which form gases that escape with the exhaust of the furnace.|$|E
50|$|Cort's process (as patented) only {{worked for}} <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> not grey cast iron, {{which was the}} usual {{feedstock}} for forges of the period. This problem was resolved probably at Merthyr Tydfil by combining puddling with one element of a slightly earlier process. This involved another kind of hearth known as a 'refinery' or 'running out fire'. The pig iron was melted in this and run out into a trough. The slag separated, and floated on the molten iron, and was removed by lowering a dam {{at the end of}} the trough. The effect of this process was to desiliconise the metal, leaving a white brittle metal, known as 'finers metal'. This was the ideal material to charge to the puddling furnace. This version of the process was known as 'dry puddling' and continued in use in some places as late as 1890.|$|E
50|$|Malleable iron {{starts as}} a white iron casting that is then heat treated {{for a day or}} two at about 950 C and then cooled over a day or two. As a result, the carbon in iron carbide {{transforms}} into graphite and ferrite plus carbon (austenite). The slow process allows the surface tension to form the graphite into spheroidal particles rather than flakes. Due to their lower aspect ratio, the spheroids are relatively short and far from one another, and have a lower cross section vis-a-vis a propagating crack or phonon. They also have blunt boundaries, as opposed to flakes, which alleviates the stress concentration problems found in grey cast iron. In general, the properties of malleable cast iron are more like those of mild steel.

50|$|A typical {{chemical}} composition {{to obtain a}} graphitic microstructure is 2.5 to 4.0% carbon and 1 to 3% silicon by weight. Graphite may occupy 6 to 10% {{of the volume of}} grey iron. Silicon is important for making grey iron as opposed to <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> because silicon is a graphite stabilizing element in cast iron, which means it helps the alloy produce graphite instead of iron carbides; at 3% silicon almost no carbon is held in chemical form as iron carbide. Another factor affecting graphitization is the solidification rate; the slower the rate, the greater the time for the carbon to diffuse and accumulate into graphite. A moderate cooling rate forms a more pearlitic matrix, while a fast cooling rate forms a more ferritic matrix. To achieve a fully ferritic matrix the alloy must be annealed. Rapid cooling partly or completely suppresses graphitization and leads to the formation of cementite, which is called white iron.|$|E

50|$|Before the Bessemer process, Western Europe and the United States {{relied on}} the {{puddling}} process to reduce the carbon content of <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> (refined pig iron), converting it to wrought iron.

The manufacturing process, called the cementation process, consisted of heating bars of wrought iron together with charcoal for periods of up to a week in a long stone box. This produced blister steel. The blister steel was put in a crucible with wrought iron and melted, producing crucible steel. Up to 3 tons of expensive coke was burnt for each ton of steel produced. Such steel when rolled into bars was sold at £50 to £60 (approximately £3,390 to £4,070 in 2008) a long ton.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> perform {{much less}} favourably in {{industrial}} service environments such as ball mills {{than would be}} predicted by standard laboratory abrasion tests. Pin abrasive tests are widely thought to simulate high stress abrasion, but in reality they grossly over-estimate service lives of white iron mill liners compared to pearlitic steel liners. The 2 ̆ 7 impact-abrasion 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis {{has suggested that the}} key difference between laboratory and service conditions is impact. However, we have found no evidence of such a phenomenon in ball mills, and instead the observed behaviour is attributed to high stress abrasion in the service environment. The defining characteristics of high stress abrasion are re-stated in a way that emphasises the load able to be transmitted to the wearing surface through the abrasive particle. Data are presented which indicate that abrasive wear mode can be identified from quantitative performance comparisons between key classes of wear-resistant alloys. Three useful diagnostics are proposed. Using these diagnostics it is shown that pin abrasive tests do not represent high stress abrasion in any industrially-relevant sense. Appropriately modest performance of white irons can be reproduced in various laboratory apparatus having zero or negligible impact energy: RWAT-analogues using solid metal wheels (xWAT), the Abex block-on-track apparatus, and a simple laboratory ball mill abrasion test (BMAT). Of these, the BMAT most closely reproduces the contact and particle mechanics of service conditions, and can give quantitative alloy performance comparisons closely matching those in service.
