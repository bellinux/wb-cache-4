Aboriginal cultural knowledge is taught to new generations through song, dance and storytelling, and Oscar was concerned. “These kids may have speech delays and difficulty remembering.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes' intent {{was not to}} analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external <b>world,</b> <b>we</b> can only know our sensations. Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes' iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) helps to explain why there is no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, {{and how it was}} possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.|$|E

He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E

Obama's social media campaign was vast, with his campaign boasting 5 million 'friends' on over 15 social networking sites, with over 3 million friends just on Facebook.

It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.|$|E
25|$|If the Standard Model is correct, the {{particles}} and forces we observe in our universe exist {{as they do}} because of underlying quantum fields. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable', or 'metastable' (meaning very long-lived but not completely stable). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise {{as they do in}} the universe's present state. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The <b>world</b> <b>we</b> know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from subatomic particles to galaxies, and all fundamental forces, would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.|$|E
