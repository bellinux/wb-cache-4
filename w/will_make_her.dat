Though she has only one feather leftâ€”as beforeâ€”she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E
500|$|Lauren's role {{becomes more}} {{prominent}} in the second season.

500|$|Lisa {{occasionally}} {{worries that}} her family's dull habits will rub off on her, {{such as in}} [...] "Lisa the Simpson" [...] (season nine, 1998) she worries that the [...] "Simpson gene" [...] <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> a dimwit later finding out the gene only goes through the male side. She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family: of her father's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality; her mother's stereotypical image and social ineptitude; and her brother's delinquent and low-brow nature. She is also concerned that Maggie may {{grow up to be}} {{like the rest of the}} family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that [...] "Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit [...] but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment." [...] Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancÃ©. In the episode [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time. Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa's intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Another {{major theme}} of Austen {{scholarship}} has concerned {{the question of}} the Bildungsroman (novel of education). D.D Devlin in Jane Austen and Education (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways [...] Bildungsroman, where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book The Way of the World [...] called Pride and Prejudice a [...] "classic" [...] Bildungsroman, where Elizabeth Bennet's [...] "prejudice" [...] against Mr. Darcy is really [...] "distrust" [...] and that she [...] "shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an excess of criticism, as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust a priori. Moretti argued that in a typical Bildungsroman of the early 19th century was concerned with [...] "everyday life", which represented [...] "an unchallenged stability of social relationships" [...] in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book The Historicity of Romantic Discourse argued that all of Austen's books were Bildungsroman, where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly [...] "internal" [...] as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their [...] "self". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel Joseph Andrews, where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her [...] "prejudice" [...] against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an [...] "external" [...] to [...] "internal" [...] conflict.|$|E
