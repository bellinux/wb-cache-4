40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} three selected ways <b>of</b> expressing <b>futurity</b> {{in modern}} English: will/shall + infinitive; the {{to be going}} to construction; and the present progressive tense. The expression <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> is explored in fiction and non-fiction separately. However, this thesis concentrates only on written English. In Part One, several approaches to the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> are introduced. In Part Two, the selected expressions <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> are presented and analysed as to their meaning, distribution, syntactic and Contextual factors. Attention is paid to the proportion of occurrence of these expressions, their meanings, and how these are affected by context (situation, subject, negation, voice) and style. Analysis is made separately for fiction and non-fiction corpus; their comparison is included in the last chapter. The frequency of the occurrence of future expressions and their meanings in the two registers are summarised in tables {{at the end of the}} work and in graphs included in the text.

40|$|The cinema {{presents}} us {{with the}} perpetual “becoming” of the movement-image. But, according to Giorgio Agamben, our relationship to the image {{is characterized by a}} desire to “capture,” inhibiting our ability to see images this way. Understood as an act of framing, this capture (a drive toward the inside of image), manifests in our acts of looking. Engaging the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze on cinema, Form Faces Out considers the concept of the out-of-field– that which relates the “captured” part to the Open whole. Through reflections on the thesis project The Here To Gathered and other works of art shown recently in Vancouver, the out-of-field is seen to destabilize the frame, making possible a form <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> that has no known characteristics other than that it is “to come. ” This form <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> opens images up to the meaning of circulation– the sharing of being...|$|R

40|$|Context – This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the conceptualization and grammatical realization <b>of</b> <b>futurity.</b> Expressing future newness through grammar is a locus for creativity, {{in the sense that}} it allows for the reflection on what is likely (projected future reality) or possibly (potentiality) going to be a future state of affairs. In addition, when studied in the broader context of ongoing discourse, grammatical constructions <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> can be tied to various epistemic viewpoints with distinct perspectives on (future) reality. Cognitive linguistics (CL) may help us in grasping the complex interplay of grammar and discourse in the expression of future events through multiple time lenses. Three cognitive frameworks – In order to arrive at a model for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> in discourse, the present paper functionally integrates three notions from CL: (1) Langacker’s (1991) extended epistemic model offers a temporal and modal setting for represented time with a possible array of positions for future-oriented predications. This model contains two axes: the vertical axis of modality, reaching from (projected) reality, over potentialis to irrealis, and the horizontal axis of immediate, near and distant future mental spaces (Fauconnier 1997). (2) Langacker’s current discourse space (CDS, Langacker 2001, 2008) represents time as discourse unfolds. It allows for the conception of a grammatical structure as a constructional assembly of time positions (indicated in (1)), referring to anticipated or past usage events in the ongoing discourse. (3) We further pursue Verhagen’s (2005) notion of intersubjectivity: linguistic structures do not only profile the object of conceptualization but do so by aligning the (inter) subjective viewpoints of multiple conceptualizers involved in a current conceptualization. In our case, different viewpoints set up different time lenses, which refer to specific temporal positions. Specific research questions – The combination of the three frameworks is targeted at addressing the question how grammar manages the representation of multiple temporal and epistemic viewpoints in ongoing discourse. More specifically, we focus on the constructional realization of three connected dimensions: (1) modal shifts on the vertical axis (realis-potentialis-irrealis); (2) temporal shifts on the horizontal axis of future events; (3) intersubjective shifts between positions set up by heterogeneous enunciative stances. Methodology and sample data – Our empirical analysis explores the grammatical realization <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> in the specific genre of science popularization. Science popularization translates technological innovation and science into a format that is accessible to the general audience. Our analysis presents a close reading of a EU Cordis documentary film on nanotech, displaying an interaction between a journalist taking the enunciative stance of the lay public and interviewees in life sciences and industry. Results – We provide a unified CL framework for the representation <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> in discourse. More specifically, this conceptual analysis shows the creative and dynamic nature of meaning construction, which integrates multiple temporal representations. This complex setting entails two aspects: a polyphonic network of enunciative stances and futuric expressions that dynamically set up intricate relations with other temporal positions.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{determine}} the distribution of variants used by New York Puerto Ricans (NYPRs) to express futurity. We also identify the constraints affecting this linguistic variable and explain their impact. Additionally, we contrast our results against those from other speech communities. We used data extracted from sociolinguistic interviews with a socially stratified group of twenty Nuyoricans. The distribution reveals that, while the periphrastic future (PF) registers {{one of the highest}} usage rates in the Hispanic world, the morphological future (MF) registers one of the lowest. The results also revealed that the factors constraining the expression <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> include imminence <b>of</b> a future event, length of MF inflection, presence of a time marker, age and education. Most of the internal constraints conditioning the expression <b>of</b> <b>futurity</b> in this community also condition it among New York Colombians as well as in Barranquilla, Colombia (Orozco 2007, 2008). These findings support Guy’s (2000) theory that the linguistic factors constraining language change and variation are consistent within different segments of a speech community. That is, the similarity of constraint effects suggests that, despite some minor differences, all three communities are still members of a larger speech community. However, the effects of external constraints, mainly the lack of significance o...|$|R
