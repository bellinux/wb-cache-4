5|$|Devil May Cry {{begins with}} Dante being {{attacked}} {{in his office}} by a mysterious woman named Trish. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother. She says the attack <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>test,</b> and that the demon emperor Mundus, whom Dante holds {{responsible for the deaths}} of his family, is planning a return. The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense castle, whereupon Trish abruptly leaps and vanishes over a high wall.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, 15 {{conservative}} Episcopal churches {{voted to}} split from the Diocese of Virginia over {{the ordination of}} openly gay bishops and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim affiliation with the larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to determine their church's affiliation, the diocese claimed the secessionist churches' buildings and properties. The resulting property law case, ultimately decided {{in favor of the}} mainline diocese, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> for Episcopal churches nationwide.|$|E

40|$|The Italian {{elections}} of 24 - 25 February 2013, gave Italians their {{first chance to}} vote after the ill-fated experiment of Mario Monti’s “technocratic government”. These elections <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> in many senses: they <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> for the parties involved {{to show signs of}} actual change and detachment from a political system that urgently needed to be cleaned up. They <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of credibility for the country as a whole, to indicate to its European partners that it was able to achieve the political stability essential to Italy’s economic recovery.

5|$|Saratoga was {{surplus to}} postwar {{requirements}} {{with the large}} numbers of Essex-class carriers in service, and she was assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946.

Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny's radio show on 21 April, while Saratoga was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini. She departed from pier 33 and headed out the Golden Gate on 1 May 1946.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, but it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> match and {{we just had to}} win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
5|$|After the tournament, Yusuke returns home, but {{has little}} time to rest as he is {{challenged}} to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane in order to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced, when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui {{with the aid of}} the spirit of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.|$|E

5|$|He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> {{selector}} for the Australian {{team from}} 1970 to 1981, filling the vacancy {{left by the}} retirement of former Test captain Ryder. Loxton's tenure on the selection panel coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket, {{on and off the}} field. Up until 1965, Australia had never lost a Test series to any country other than England, and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship. However, in the next five years, Australia lost away to the West Indies 2–1, and to South Africa twice, 3–1 and 4–0 respectively. The former all-rounder became a selector after the whitewash in South Africa, joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel. During the 1970–71 home series against England, which Australia lost 2–1, the trio made a raft of changes, handing debuts to nine players, the largest number in a season since 1945–46 when competition resumed after World War II. One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee, who went on to become one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers and the world’s leading wicket-taker. However, the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate; he only learned of his omission second hand.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to {{the list}} of {{buildings}} to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E
5|$|To further {{understand}} {{the mysteries of}} the Foretellers and the future, the player, Chirithy, and Skuld re-enter the Foretellers' tower where they are caught by a Foreteller. They are also told that Ephemer is a traitor to his union and that he has disappeared. The player then challenges the Foreteller to a duel, assuming Ephemer has been captured, but is easily defeated. The Foreteller reveals that she is in fact Master Ava, and that the player's quest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of their character to see if they are worthy of leaving this world before the Great War between light and darkness. Keyblade wielders that can resist the darkness and fight for what they believe in, like their friends, are worthy of becoming elite Keyblade warriors known as Dandelions and going on to the Realm of Light and avoiding the coming universal war. All who stay will become a part of that war and must face an uncertain future. Skuld accepts the offer, but the player's character is uncertain if they should join Ephemer, who has gone on to the Realm of Light, or stay and fight to save the future. Later, they encounter two Keyblade warriors accusing each other of stealing Lux from their unions, and the player is forced to fight Master Aced, who defeats them. Ira arrives to stop the fighting. Aced claims that he is collecting more Keyblade warriors to prepare for the upcoming war before leaving. Ira informs the player, Skuld, and Chirithy that the war cannot be avoided and {{that there will be no}} victor. The only Foreteller who may have a solution is Gula so the trio go to look for him.|$|E
