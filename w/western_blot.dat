5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., <b>western</b> <b>blot</b> or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by <b>western</b> <b>blot</b> are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate <b>western</b> <b>blot</b> result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
5|$|Practically, several {{immunodiagnostic}} methods {{based on}} detection of complex antigen-antibody {{are used to}} diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, <b>Western</b> <b>blot,</b> immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic immunoassay.

5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate <b>western</b> <b>blot</b> results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
40|$|AbstractProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is {{involved}} {{in a wide range of}} functions in the nucleus. However, a substantial amount of PCNA is also present in the cytoplasm, although their function is unknown. Here we show, through Far-Western blotting and mass spectrometry, that PCNA is associated with several cytoplasmic oncoproteins, including elongation factor, malate dehydrogenase, and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Surprisingly, PCNA is also associated with six glycolytic enzymes that are involved in the regulation of steps 4 – 9 in the glycolysis pathway.

5|$|In research, {{purified}} antibodies {{are used}} in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine.

They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a cell lysate, in <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis, and in immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells {{with the assistance of}} a microscope.

40|$|<b>Western</b> <b>blotting</b> electrophoretic {{sequencing}} is {{an analytical}} technique {{widely used in}} Functional Proteomics to detect, recognize and quantify specific labelled proteins in biological samples. A commonly used label for <b>western</b> <b>blotting</b> is Enhanced ChemiLuminescence (ECL) reagents based on fluorescent light emission of Luminol at 425 nm. Film emulsion is the conventional detection medium, but is characterized by non-linear response and limited dynamic range. Several <b>western</b> <b>blotting</b> digital imaging systems have being developed, mainly based {{on the use of}} cooled Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) and single avalanche diodes that address these issues. Even so these systems present key drawbacks, such as a low frame rate and require operation at low temperature.

Multiplexing is commonly used for quantitation of one protein relative to a protein of known abundance (housekeeping protein). It can also be used for the detection and quantitation of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, provided that there are antibodies available. In this study, a two-dimensional <b>Western</b> <b>blotting</b> approach was evaluated in addition to the traditional 1 D workflow, using fluorescent secondary antibodies, namely the ECL Plex <b>Western</b> <b>Blotting</b> Detection System.

25|$|To {{create a}} <b>western</b> <b>blot,</b> gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in <b>western</b> <b>blot</b> analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
