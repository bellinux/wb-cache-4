Not only did the division dramatically increase the production of forest products for the war effort, but the transportation network that it built helped open up Pacific Northwest forests to greater use in the decades that followed. In addition, the division's <b>work</b> <b>rules</b> became the standard for logging and sawmill operations throughout the Pacific Northwest well into the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some <b>work</b> <b>rules</b> and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E

25|$|In most unions, the organiser's role is {{to recruit}} groups of workers under the {{organizing}} model.

25|$|Negotiations with attendants {{had been}} ongoing and {{contentious}} for several years.

25|$|The union did strike, however. On November 1, 1979, 35,000 UAW workers (36 {{percent of}} International Harvester's workforce) at 21 plants in eight states—Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas—struck International Harvester at noon rather than accept the new <b>work</b> <b>rules</b> and {{mandatory}} overtime provisions.

25|$|With {{the rapid}} growth and {{consolidation}} of large railroad systems after 1870, union organizations sprang up, covering the entire nation. By 1901, 17 major railway brotherhoods were in operation; they generally worked amicably with management, which recognized their usefulness. Key unions included the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. Their main goal was building insurance and medical packages for their members, and negotiating bureaucratic <b>work</b> <b>rules</b> that favored their membership, such as seniority and grievance procedures.|$|E

Deloitte representatives and District officials have pointed fingers at each other. Some of the problems have been software and hardware, some have been due to the complexity of labor agreements, salary scales, <b>work</b> <b>rules</b> and job assignments within the district.|$|E
25|$|Loosening load-in rules: The load-in period {{may last}} several weeks and cost $1 million or more. Current <b>work</b> <b>rules</b> require {{producers}} to determine ahead of time how many stagehands are needed on each given day. These numbers cannot change once load-in begins, requiring producers to pay salaries even if no work occurs. The rule ensures that workers will not be on call (and unpaid for it) during the load-in period. The producers proposed essentially eliminating the rule. The union agreed to loosen the rule, but sought to keep a minimum number of stagehands at work each day.|$|E

At the time, the Southern California carpenters' union had hundreds of mostly autonomous local unions which managed their own affairs (some well, some not), set their own <b>work</b> <b>rules,</b> competed with one another for jobs, and ran their own hiring halls.

25|$|The CIO {{was born}} out of a {{fundamental}} dispute within the United States labor movement over whether and how to organize industrial workers. Those who favored craft unionism believed that {{the most effective way to}} represent workers was to defend the advantages that they had secured through their skills. They focused on the hiring of skilled workers, such as carpenters, lithographers, and railroad engineers in an attempt to maintain as much control as possible over the work their members did by enforcement of <b>work</b> <b>rules,</b> zealous defense of their jurisdiction to certain types of work, control over apprenticeship programs, and exclusion of less-skilled workers from membership.|$|E
