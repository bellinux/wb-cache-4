40|$|This work is {{directed}} towards {{a study of}} full-slice or "wafer-scale integrated" - semiconductor memory. Previous approaches to full slice technology are studied and critically compared. It is shown that a fault-tolerant, fixed-interconnection approach offers many advantages; such a technique forms {{the basis of the}} experimental work. The disadvantages of the conventional technology are reviewed to illustrate the potential improvements in cost, packing density and reliability obtainable with <b>wafer-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (W. S. l). Iterative chip arrays are modelled by a pseudorandom fault distribution; algorithms to control the linking of adjacent good - chips into linear chains are proposed and investigated by computer simulation. It is demonstrated that long chains may be produced at practicable yield levels. The on-chip control circuitry and the external control electronics required to implement one particular algorithm are described in relation to a TTL simulation of an array of 4 X 4 integrated circuit chips. A layout of the on-chip control logic is shown to require (in 40 dynamic MOS circuitry) an area equivalent to 250 shift register stages -a reasonable overhead on large memories. Structures are proposed to extend the fixed-interconnection, fault-tolerant concept to parallel/serial organised memory - covering RAM, ROM and Associative Memory applications requiring up to 2 M bits of storage. Potential problem areas in implementing W. S. I are discussed and it is concluded that current technology is capable of manufacturing such devices.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high-performance}} chip-scale lasers has driven {{rapid growth in}} integrated photonics. The creation of such low-noise laser sources is critical for emerging on-chip applications, ranging from coherent optical communications, photonic microwave oscillators remote sensing and optical rotational sensors. While Brillouin lasers are a promising solution to these challenges, new strategies are needed to create robust, compact, low power and low cost Brillouin laser technologies through <b>wafer-scale</b> <b>integration.</b> To date, chip-scale Brillouin lasers have remained elusive due to the difficulties in realization of these lasers on a commercial integration platform. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, monolithically integrated Brillouin lasers using a wafer-scale process based on an ultra-low loss Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 waveguide platform. Cascading of stimulated Brillouin lasing to 10 Stokes orders was observed in an integrated bus-coupled resonator with a loaded Q factor exceeding 28 million. We experimentally quantify the laser performance, including threshold, slope efficiency and cascading dynamics, and compare the results with theory. The large mode volume integrated resonator and gain medium supports a TE-only resonance and unique 2. 72 GHz free spectral range, essential for high performance integrated Brillouin lasing. The laser {{is based on a}} non-acoustic guiding design that supplies a broad Brillouin gain bandwidth. Characteristics for high performance lasing are demonstrated due to large intra-cavity optical power and low lasing threshold power.
