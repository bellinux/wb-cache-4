5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{arose from}} the film when the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball teams of the late 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo {{claimed to be the}} originators of baggy shorts in basketball.

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.

5|$|As cancers do not {{immediately}} emerge after {{exposure to radiation}} instead radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years. An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality, {{could be due to}} radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study.|$|E
5|$|Civilians <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{evacuation}} {{suffered the}} consequences of the military action along Route 7. Most of the civilians who followed the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E

5|$|In the First World War, 320 {{soldiers}} {{came from}} Mersea Island, of which 50 lost their lives. They are commemorated at the War Memorial at the parish church. Troops were stationed at Mersea Island during the war. In 1916, a Zeppelin crash landed at nearby Great Wigborough {{to the northwest}} of the island. The survivors were stationed at Mersea before moving to prisoner-of-war camps.

5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when {{he stopped}} working as a journalist in 1996.

Masao Higashi, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> award's preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students killing each other being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E

Indulgences were to be granted to all those <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great enterprise.

To support the attack, a tank squadron from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars and five regiments of artillery {{were assigned to the}} division. The assault had to negotiate both the British and German artillery fire, which killed or wounded several men, including some senior officers. The attackers eventually reached and secured the village.
