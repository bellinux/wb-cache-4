25|$|In a {{demonstration}} at the Material Vision Fair in Frankfurt in November 2005, {{a team from}} TU Darmstadt in Germany showed several panels that were hit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> mallet, and the panel with the piezo element immediately stopped swinging.|$|E
25|$|The {{single seat}} {{aircraft}} {{was made from}} ash and spruce wood coated with aluminum powder. It used forward mounted finlets to stabilize the aircraft. It was powered by the last six cylinder engine built by the Wright Brothers <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> band drive on the flywheel. The 406 cubic inch engine ran at 1,400 to 1560rpm powering two counterrotating propellers via chains.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 14 {{production}} Hengist Mk I were {{delivered to the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) between February 1943 and March 1944. One of Frost's unique design touches was to fit the Hengist <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> bag as a landing device. A strengthened undercarriage was used on the production aircraft and was called the Mk III, but this name was not carried over to the RAF.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to actions against villages the British Army also conducted punitive {{actions in the}} cities. In Nablus in August 1938 almost 5,000 men were held in a cage for two days and interrogated one after another. During their detention the city was searched and then each of the detainees was marked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> stamp on his release. At one point a night curfew was imposed {{on most of the}} cities.|$|E
25|$|Rødovre Town Hall, {{built from}} 1952 to 1956, shows how well Jacobsen {{combined}} {{the use of}} different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and stainless steel. It is also noted for its central staircase, suspended from the roof on orange-red steel rods. The sides are cut from 5cm steel plate, painted a dark grey; the steps, only a few millimeters thick, are stainless steel <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> coating on the upper side for better grip.|$|E
25|$|When a ball rolls {{back to the}} ball-lift wheel, {{friction}} {{lifts the}} ball up to the side where it catches on two lift rods covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> material. Wedged in between, the ball is rolled upward. When {{it gets to the}} top, it is deposited onto a metal track that usually leads underground, and is pushed along by a long accelerator belt. Finally, the ball is pushed upward by two wheels located {{at the head of the}} ball return track, where it is deposited.|$|E

25|$|The iron lung, {{also known}} as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was {{developed}} in 1929 {{and was one of the}} first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> gasket so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance inspection: All {{types of}} {{extinguishers}} should be inspected {{at least once}} a year. The extinguisher is checked that it has the correct volume and pressure of extinguishing agent, that it is within the required hydrotest and internal maintenance intervals, that it is in good condition, and that all external parts are still serviceable. Dry chemical and dry powder types may also be hit on the bottom <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> mallet to make sure the powder is free-flowing. After inspection, the tech will attach a new tamper seal and yearly service tag around the pin.|$|E
25|$|If {{this image}} were {{transferred}} directly to paper, {{it would create}} a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> blanket, which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or offset to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as offset lithography or offset printing.|$|E

30|$|Batch {{tests were}} carried out in 1 -L glass bottles with 200  mL of minimal medium. Bottles were capped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cored <b>rubber</b> stopper {{containing}} <b>a</b> sectioned Balch tube <b>with</b> <b>a</b> butyl <b>rubber</b> stopper and aluminum crimp seal, allowing for sample collection. Bottles were successively vacuum-degassed to − 1.7  atm and pressurized with either N 2 or N 2 O at 1.3  atm, three times. The final headspace contained either N 2 or N 2 O at 1.3  atm. Batch tests {{were carried out}} at least in triplicate.|$|R

25|$|Front {{suspension}} uses {{a separate}} spring and damper <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> top mount. The rear {{suspension of the}} W124 features the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes 190 and which is now standard on many modern cars. Estate cars (and optionally, saloons and coupés) had Citroen-like rear self-leveling suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.|$|E
25|$|The JD-2 was {{a wooden}} {{construction}} low-wing braced monoplane, conventional in layout, with open cockpits. A fuselage was rectangular in cross-section, plywood-covered. In the JD-2bis, the fuselage was aluminium covered in an engine section. Wings were two-piece, rectangular with straight tips, two-spar, covered with canvas and plywood (in front section), supported with twin struts. Conventional empennage, covered with plywood (fins) and canvas (elevators and rudder). Two open cockpits in tandem, with individual windshields and twin controls. A safety cage of steel pipes {{was above the}} front cockpit (JD-2) or before the front cockpit (JD-2bis). It had a fixed conventional landing gear, sprung <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> rope, with a common axle and a rear skid.|$|E
25|$|The blade is {{connected}} to a long cylindrical cane handle, {{similar to that of}} a mid-20th-century tennis racquet, by means of a splice. The handle is usually covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> grip. Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a tapered splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson, a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel. Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break {{at the corner of the}} join. The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat's blade to the handle and avoids this problem.|$|E

25|$|Micro-contact {{printing}} or {{soft lithography}} {{is analogous to}} printing ink <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> stamp. The SAM molecules are inked onto a pre-shaped elastomeric stamp with a solvent and transferred to the substrate surface by stamping. The SAM solution {{is applied to the}} entire stamp but only areas that make contact with the surface allow transfer of the SAMs. The transfer of the SAMs is a complex diffusion process that depends on the type of molecule, concentration, duration of contact, and pressure applied. Typical stamps use PDMS because its elastomeric properties, E = 1.8 MPa, allow it to fit the countour of micro surfaces and its low surface energy, γ = 21.6 dyn/cm². This is a parallel process and can thus place nanoscale objects over a large area in a short time.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} process start with mother rolls. First, the etched, roughened and pre-formed anode foil {{on the mother}} roll {{as well as the}} spacer paper and the cathode foil are cut to the required width. The foils are fed to an automatic winder, which makes a wound section in a consecutive operation involving three sequential steps: terminal welding, winding, and length cutting. In the next production step the wound section fixed at the lead out terminals is soaked with electrolyte under vacuum impregnation. The impregnated winding is then built into an aluminum case, provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> sealing disc, and mechanically tightly sealed by curling. Thereafter, the capacitor is provided with an insulating shrink sleeve film. This optically ready capacitor is then contacted at rated voltage in a high temperature post-forming device for healing all the dielectric defects resulting from the cutting and winding procedure. After post-forming, a 100% final measurement of capacitance, leakage current, and impedance takes place. Taping closes the manufacturing process; the capacitors are ready for delivery.|$|E
25|$|The {{athletic}} facilities {{include an}} indoor pool and three gymnasiums, as well as, around the campus, the William P. Wilder sports complex (containing an NHL and an Olympic sized hockey rink, {{one of only}} four in Ontario), a sports activity bubble, tennis courts, a sports court, a running track, and nine regulation sized sports fields. The two major fields of the Upper School are called Commons and Lords, after, respectively, the British House of Commons and House of Lords, {{and one of the}} main central fields is known as the Oval (covered in winter by a bubble). In the summer of 2006, the latter, along with the encompassing running track, was renovated, with the grass replaced by a partially synthetic astroturf/grass hybrid and the track paved <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> turf. Several meters below the field, geothermal pipes were laid to provide alternative energy heating for both the Upper School and the adjacent sports complex. A number of these facilities are the result of a decade long, $90 million capital building campaign launched in the 1990s. Still planned are an Olympic-standard, 50-metre swimming pool; a new racquet centre for squash, badminton, and tennis; a rowing centre; the expansion of both the Prep and Upper School academic buildings; and an expansion of the archives.|$|E

25|$|Bathing and {{swimming}} are illegal at Marina beach since the undercurrent {{in the region}} is very strong, and there are no lifeguards stationed here. As many people throng the beach, quite often there are drowning mishaps. An estimated five sea-bathers are drowned every month at the beach, and most of the swimmers are dragged by the tides into the debris of a tramp ship SS Damatis that sank off the beach during a cyclone in 1966. Police personnel and lifeguards constantly patrol the whole area, which is divided into seventy-two sections, by means of horses and all-terrain vehicles (known as beach buggies). Five spots off the beach, including near the Anna Square, Kannagi Statue, Triumph of Labour Statue and behind Vivekananda House, have been identified by the police as extremely unsafe due to the presence of whirlpools and rock projections in the seabed. In 2010, 75 people drowned in the sea along the 5-km stretch of the beach. Of this, the 1-km stretch from Anna Square to the Anna swimming pool is considered the most dangerous with as many as 29 persons drowning in the sea in 2010. The deep sea in this stretch is considered to still hold parts of the smacked ship. In 2011, in addition to the tie-up with Coast Guard security personnel, the city police planned for a tie-up with the fire and rescue services department to provide a stand-by rescue team at the beach to save people from drowning. The rescue team, equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> boat and a motor-fitted boat, was planned to be stationed at the Anna Square police station or the Marina police station.|$|E

500|$|According to Sammon, [...] "one of the {{greatest}} special effects in the film [...] Thulsa Doom's onscreen transformation into a giant snake". It involved footage of fake body parts, live and dummy snakes, miniatures, and other camera tricks combined into a flowing sequence with lap dissolve. After Jones was filmed in position, he {{was replaced by a}} hollow framework <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> mask that was pushed from behind by a snake head-shaped puppet to give the illusion of Doom's facial bones changing. [...] The head was then replaced with a [...] mechanical snake; as it moved outwards, a crew member pressed a foot pedal to collapse the framework. For the final part of the sequence, a real snake was filmed on a miniature set.|$|E
