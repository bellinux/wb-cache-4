Three sampling locations were chosen along the shores of Long Island Sound and four were chosen in interior sections of Connecticut. Sampling sites were chosen to represent both rural and urban sectors. <b>Wet</b> deposition <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen species was calculated using wet concentrations, the volume of collected precipitation and the opening surface area <b>of</b> the Aerochemetrics <b>wet</b> deposition collector.

40|$|Mercury (Hg) {{concentrations}} and deposition fluxes in precipitation and litterfall {{were measured}} at multiple sites (six rural sites and an urban site) {{across a broad}} geographic area in China. The annual deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> Hg in precipitation at rural sites and an urban site were 2. 0 to 7. 2 and 12. 6  ±  6. 5  µg m − 2  yr − 1, respectively. <b>Wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> Hg at rural sites showed a clear regional difference with elevated deposition fluxes in the subtropical zone, followed by the temporal zone and arid/semi-arid zone.

This suggests that uptake of atmospheric Hg by foliage is the dominant pathway to remove atmospheric Hg in forest ecosystems in China. <b>Wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> Hg at rural sites of China were generally lower compared to those in North America and Europe, possibly due to a combination of lower precipitation depth, lower GOM concentrations in the troposphere and the generally lower cloud base heights at most sites that wash out a smaller amount of GOM and PBM during precipitation events...|$|R
40|$|Measuring <b>wet</b> {{deposition}} <b>of</b> {{organic carbon}} (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) aerosol {{is crucial for}} the understanding of their circulation and climate effect. To further understand the <b>wet</b> deposition <b>of</b> particulate carbon (OC and EC), precipitation samples were collected from April to August 2014 on Xiamen Island in China. EC and water insoluble organic carbon (WIOC) concentrations were analyzed using a thermal optical method to investigate temporal variations and wet deposition fluxes. The average EC and WIOC concentrations were 7. 3 μgC·L− 1 and 495. 3 μgC·L− 1, respectively, which are both comparable to the results reported in European areas. EC and WIOC concentrations were higher in spring than in summer. Higher EC concentrations were found in April, which were probably associated with the transport of air masses from northern continental areas. Higher WIOC concentrations were found in May and were mainly attributed to air masses from the South China Sea. Lower concentrations of EC and WIOC in the summer were primarily due to the clean air masses transported from the ocean. The wet deposition flux was calculated {{as the product of}} concentration and precipitation amount. Average <b>wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> EC and WIOC were estimated to be 0. 6 mgC·m− 2 ·month− 1 and 36. 7 mgC·m− 2 ·month− 1, respectively. <b>Wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> EC and WIOC exhibited similar concentration trends.

Additional features not treated in traditional studies are addressed such as contaminant adsorption onto raindrops and enhancement of dry gaseous diffusive fluxes due to rain-induced turbulence. Wet deposition estimates show a high spatial and seasonal variability, with maxima located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and in low-temperature regions.

A nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) hotspot is clearly visible from space over the South African Mpumalanga Highveld, while South Africa is also regarded as the 9 th largest anthropogenic sulphur (S) emitting country. Notwithstanding the importance of South Africa with regard to nitrogen (N) and S emissions, very limited data has been published on the chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> deposition for this region. This paper presents the concentrations of sodium (Na+), ammonium (NH 4 +), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca 2 +), magnesium (Mg 2 +), nitrate (NO 3 −), chloride (Cl−), sulphate (SO 42 −) and water-soluble organic acids (OA) in the wet deposition samples collected between 2009 and 2014  at four South African IDAF (IGAC DEBITS Africa) sites, which are regarded as regional representatives of the north-eastern interior. Also, <b>wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> the ten ions are calculated and presented in this paper. The {{results show that the}} total ionic concentrations and <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> deposition were much higher at the two sites closer to anthropogenic emissions, while the pH <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> deposition at these two sites were lower compared to that of the two sites that were less impacted by anthropogenic emissions.. The major sources of the ten ions included marine, terrigenous (crust), fossil fuel combustion, agriculture and biomass burning. Significant contributions from fossil fuel combustion were determined for the two sites in close proximity to anthropogenic source regions. The results of back trajectory analysis, however, did indicate that the two remote sites are also affected by air masses passing over the source region through anti-cyclonic recirculation. The largest contributions at the two sites distant from the anthropogenic source regions were marine sources, while the impact of biomass burning was also more significant at the remote sites. Comparison to previous wet deposition measurements at the South African IDAF sites indicated increases in the <b>wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> S and N, and more wet deposition events with lower pH.

A sensitivity study on cloud and rain droplet pH has been performed to investigate {{its impact on}} model sulphate production and gas wet scavenging. Air concentrations and <b>wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> the model sensitivity runs have been analysed and compared to observations. It was found that droplet pH variation within atmospheric ranges affects modelled air concentrations and wet deposition fluxes significantly. Applying a droplet pH of 5. 5 for July 2005, mean sulphate air concentrations increased by up to 10 % compared to using a droplet pH of 5 while SO 2 domain wet deposition sum increased by 110 %. Moreover, model results using modelled droplet pH for January and July 2005 have been compared to model results applying a constant pH of 5 and to observations. The comparison to observations has shown that using a variable droplet pH improves the model performance concerning air concentrations and <b>wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> the investigated sulphur and nitrogen compounds. For SO x wet deposition fluxes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreased by 16 % for July 2005 when using a variable droplet pH instead of a constant pH of 5. Concerning sulphate and SO 2 air concentrations the RMSE was reduced by 8 % and 16 % for July 2005, respectively. The results have revealed that applying a variable droplet pH is preferable to using a constant pH leading to better consistency concerning air concentrations and wet deposition fluxes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the source-receptor relationship (SRR) of sulfur over Northeast Asia was examined using a chemical transport model (RAQM) off-line coupled with a meteorological model (MM 5). The simulation was conducted for the entire year of 2002. The results were evaluated using monitoring data for six remote stations of the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET). The modeled SO 2 and O 3 concentrations agreed well with the observations quantitatively. The modeled aerosol and <b>wet</b> deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> SO 4 2 − were underestimated by 30 % and 50 %, respectively. The domain was divided into 5 source-receptor regions: (I) North China; (II) Central China; (III) South China; (IV) South Korea; and (V) Japan. The sulfur deposition in each receptor region amounted to about 50 – 75 % of the emissions from the same region. The largest contribution to the deposition in each region was originated from the same region, accounting for 53 – 84 %. The second largest contribution was due to Region II, supplying 14 – 43 %. The {{spatial distribution}}s of the SRRs revealed that subregional values varied by about {{two times more than}} regional averages due to nonuniformity across the deposition fields. Examining the spatial distributions of the deposition fields was important for identifying subregional areas where the deposition was highest within a receptor region. The horizontal distribution changed substantially according to season...|$|R
