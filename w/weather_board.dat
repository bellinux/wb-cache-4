It was funded by public subscription and built local builder Davis Brothers on donated land. It was built as a [...] <b>weather</b> <b>board</b> building set on stone foundations, with a corrugated iron roof. There was a near tragedy in the hall in late 1922 when a generator caught fire while the hall was being used by 300 people. The inwards opening doors and lack of a fire door were cited as significant problems. Chudleigh had a post office from 1865. Around 1899 it was {{moved to a new}} building though it has since been closed and the building sold as a private home. Chudleigh had a registered maternity hospital in the early 20th century.

500|$|Samuel Pratt Winter {{was sent}} to Tasmania by his father, at Bryan's request, {{to act as an}} {{overseer}} of the mill.

A post office opened in November 1841, and at the end of the year the village had also four dwellings, a blacksmith shop, a police station, the flour mill and an adobe hotel built by John Archer. While passing through the town Louisa Anne Meredith took note of the buildings. In her guidebook, published in 1843, she referred to the [...] "crazy <b>weather</b> <b>board</b> mill". At the time the mill's motive power came from an overshot water wheel supplied with water from the Liffey River via a long wooden trough. St Andrew's church was built in 1843 by Thomas Reibey as a school. The initial church grounds of [...] were donated by Thomas Reibey. [...] Winter was living at the mill cottage in 1846, when he arranged for the old wooden mill to be removed and, with John Kinder Archer, began building the blue-stone mill. The town greatly expanded in the late 1850s, fueled by the efforts of those returning from the Victorian gold fields. Over time many cottages in Carrick were built for workers on the Reibey's Entally House outside nearby Hadspen.|$|E
