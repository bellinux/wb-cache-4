500|$|The Daily Mirror lauded Red Bull {{designer}} Adrian Newey {{for making}} the decision to change the engine mapping on Vettel's car after reviewing photos of the damage sustained in the first lap accident. Newey was quoted saying: [...] "So we photographed it going past, saw huge crease in exhaust, which usually means it will soon crack and the bodywork catch fire. [...] So <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> engine mapping to keep the exhaust as cool as we could, even though it meant lost performance".|$|E
500|$|Tala (meaning [...] "Stalking Wolf") (voiced by Rose McGowan): The game's second female protagonist. Tala is a Native American shaman and a power-hungry Darkwatch agent. When she was young, Tala {{lost her}} seer mother {{and became an}} outcast from her own tribe, fearful of her mediumship abilities. Her father was then killed by a band of fur traders and she herself was kidnapped and abused by them, until her captors were killed by vampires. Tala was then herself rescued by the Darkwatch troops, who turned her into one of their own. However, her {{experiences}} made her extremely bitter, and she began pursuing ever more power at any cost, secretly desiring to get revenge upon {{the world for the}} death of her parents. Despite her ruthlessness, Tala quickly rose through the Darkwatch ranks due to her fearless battle efficiency. The developers described her as not evil but [...] "just ambitious". Tala is the only character who uses kicks in the game, due to the artists deciding that [...] "some of the combat moves the actress performed fit the character so well that <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> combat system she's using." [...] If fought as the final boss, she turns into a demon. According to GameSpy, Tala is [...] "without question, the more difficult boss to battle." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Horton, {{expressed}} that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson's character, Miranda Bailey, was {{to focus on}} the similarities between her and the actress, noting that [...] "there's not a mean bone in her body, but she's solid and steady, like a rock." [...] Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character's personality, noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past, to a maternal outlook on her interns. She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character, describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers, rather than someone living inside her. Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character: [...] "She gets to be flawed, she gets to be tired, she can be cranky, she can be grumpy." [...] Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months. Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson's portrayal of her character [...] "sweet and wonderful", naming her a professional: [...] "She makes you be a better actor, just by being there." [...] She also described her performance during her character's labor as [...] "heart-breaking, tender, powerful and wonderful", noting how she managed to transform the strong character into [...] "a weak woman, struggling to fight the unusual situation". Fellow cast member James Pickens, Jr. described Wilson's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as [...] "a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively", also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater. Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc, which he stated to have been planning {{since the beginning of the}} series. He stated that the plot of the episodes had to [...] "fill the demands of the Super Bowl", which was scheduled to air in the same night: [...] "We really wanted something different and Shonda [...] came up with the idea of this bomb, that we found simply outstanding!" [...] Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how [...] "breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together". He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord, an element they had been trying to avoid, for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous, and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material. He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor: [...] "When we filmed it, there was a moment, a fraction of a second, when <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> body with the actor." ...|$|E

But import copies got in and, as you know, in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs {{and so we had}} a gay audience, {{a lot of people who}} were convinced the music was specifically for them.

2500|$|Eight retired {{generals and}} admirals called for Rumsfeld to resign in early 2006 {{in what was}} called the [...] "Generals Revolt", accusing him of [...] "abysmal" [...] {{military}} planning and lack of strategic competence. Commentator Pat Buchanan reported at the time that Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who traveled often to Iraq and supported the war, said the generals [...] "mirror the views of 75 percent of the officers in the field, and probably more". Rumsfeld rebuffed these criticisms, stating that [...] "out of thousands and thousands of admirals and generals, if every time two or three people disagreed <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> secretary of defense of the United States, it would be like a merry-go-round." [...] Bush defended his secretary throughout, and responded by stating that Rumsfeld is [...] "exactly what is needed".|$|E
2500|$|Pritzker {{asked the}} justices to {{consider}} {{other examples of}} situations where the ordinance's underlying theory would be problematic. The village, he recalled, had found support for part of its ordinance in the prohibition of alcohol sales to minors. One of the devices sold by the Flipside that it had complained about was a small mirror with [...] "Cocaine" [...] written on it. [...] " [...] be so clear that if a child cannot possess liquor, would it be unlawful for him to possess a Schlitz glass, a beer mug with the word Schlitz on it? And since he can't drink, would it be unlawful {{for him to have}} a Johnny Walker Red mirror?" [...] Many tobacconists' shops had sold books and magazines as well, often related to tobacco use. [...] "Suppose we take Dunhill, and their pipe shop, and their pipe array, and we add to that the posters," [...] he asked. [...] "Does that change the marketing aspect? Do we have NORML posters, and Liberate Marijuana, and those kind of posters on the wall? Now we are displaying the same merchandise, but have <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> manner of display?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Norma Jean entered Glow in the Dark {{studios in}} Atlanta with record {{producer}} Jeremy Griffith (Saosin, Forever Changed, Cool Hand Luke) and Pro Tools audio engineer Justin Chapman to record Meridional February 1, 2010. They {{spent the first}} three days in pre-production creating live recordings of all the songs for the record. Griffith suggested that the band track guitars before bass guitars, which is backwards from conventional recording methods. Vocalist Cory Brandan stated that this switch was, [...] "a great idea because <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> chords and progressions on a lot of songs throughout recording, so we were able to have the bass follow the guitars and {{be a part of the}} rhythm section more accurately." [...] Norma Jean welcomed Griffith's input on the album. During recording, he would occasionally record his own vocal tracks for songs to see how the band liked his ideas. Griffith contributed backing vocals to a number of songs, and also played piano. [...] The group used a wide array of instruments in addition to the piano from Glow in the Dark studios, including acoustic guitars, organs, random percussion, and a lap steel guitar. Norma Jean also used a variety of guitar tunings from [...] "drop C#, to C and occasionally to super low B" [...] in order to prevent [...] "songs from blending in together" [...] and help make [...] "writing and recording more interesting." [...] Recording and production was finished before the end of February. Meridional resulted in the largest number of tracks Norma Jean had recorded in one session to date, with 13 songs and three short interludes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} debate is a long-running {{controversy}} {{about the risks}} and benefits of using nuclear reactors to generate electricity for civilian purposes. [...] The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, as more and more reactors were built and came online, and [...] "reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies" [...] in some countries. [...] Thereafter, the nuclear industry created jobs, focused on safety and public concerns [...] mostly waned. In the last decade, however, with growing public awareness about climate change and the critical role that carbon dioxide and methane emissions plays in causing the heating of the earth's atmosphere, there's been a resurgence in the intensity nuclear power debate once again. [...] Nuclear power advocates and those who are most concerned about climate change point to nuclear power's reliable, emission-free, high-density energy and a generation of young physicists and engineers working to bring a new generation of nuclear technology into existence to replace fossil fuels. On the other hand, skeptics can point to two frightening nuclear accidents, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and subsequently the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, combined with escalating acts of global terrorism, to argue against continuing use of the technology. The debate continues today between those who fear the power of nuclear and those who fear {{what will happen to the}} earth if we don't use nuclear power. At the 1963 ground-breaking for what would become the world's largest nuclear power plant, President John F. Kennedy declared that nuclear power was a [...] "step on the long road to peace," [...] and that by using [...] "science and technology to achieve significant breakthroughs" [...] that we could [...] "conserve the resources" [...] to leave the world in better shape. Yet he also acknowledged that the Atomic Age was a [...] "dreadful age" [...] and [...] "when we broke the atom apart, <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> history of the world." ...|$|E
