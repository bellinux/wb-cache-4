40|$|Wireless {{communication}} collision coding devices, systems, {{and methods}} are provided. According to some embodiments, wireless communication systems can generally comprise {{a plurality of}} <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> and <b>wireless</b> clients. The <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> can be controlled by a network controller. The <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> can be configured to enable a plurality of wireless clients to wirelessly connect to the <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> The <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> can be configured to encode data packets destined for the wireless clients with a collision coding scheme so that wireless data packets concurrently transmitted from at least two <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> colliding in air can be decoded at the wireless clients with the collision coding scheme so that data packets are not affected by collisions with another data packet.

The school spent its first five decades relatively unchanged in terms of architecture. In 2006, an extra gym was added. Most recently, the new science wing was opened as well as a new entrance building. This school {{is one of the first}} locally to provide every student with a laptop, which can be taken home, and be used in school everyday. Every classroom is fitted with a <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> (IEEE 802.11 a/g/n), which provides the students with internet. For the 2007-08 school year, the school upgraded all the laptop computers to Apple MacBooks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose the}} {{creation}} of a wireless storage area network (SAN) and analyze its benefits. The proposed wireless SAN (WSAN) consists of a SAN switch that is connected to multiple <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> (APs) that communicate with the storage devices. This network would save space and reduce overall costs by not requiring wired connections. Wireless SANS would also provide more freedom in the placement of storage devices. However, because the number of <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> is less than the number of storage devices, it is possible for user data requests to be blocked if all <b>access</b> <b>points</b> are busy. An important design goal is therefore to minimize the probability that a network access request will be blocked.
