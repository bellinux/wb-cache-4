5|$|This <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> resented by Mírzá Yahyá, {{who began}} trying to {{discredit}} Bahá'u'lláh, thus driving many people away from the religion. Tensions in the community mounted, and in 1854 Bahá'u'lláh {{decided to leave the}} city to pursue a solitary life.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of low floor trams and buses <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> required by law, whereas {{the use of}} inaccessible features such as paternosters in public buildings without any alternative methods of wheelchair access <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> deprecated.

5|$|Although still young, Henry <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{gaining a}} {{reputation}} as an energetic and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII of France, and the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge swathe of territory across France.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Cristaldi joined her in the United States. While the two were staying in Atlanta, he surprised her by taking her to their wedding ceremony which he had arranged without her knowledge. She went ahead with the ceremony, but was concerned about sacrificing the rights she had to her child Patrick. She also realized she <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> unable {{to make decisions about}} her own life. The marriage was never made official in Italy.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E

5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, but new technology <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E
5|$|Godoy's {{attempt to}} subdue the Maya around Champoton was {{unsuccessful}} {{and the local}} Kowoj Maya resisted his attempts to assert Spanish dominance of the region. This resistance was sufficiently tenacious that Montejo the Younger sent his cousin from Tabasco to Champoton to take command. His diplomatic overtures to the Champoton Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule. Champoton was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucatán Peninsula; it <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> isolated and the situation there became difficult.|$|E
5|$|Idris' {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> unpopular by {{the latter}} 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system {{in order to take}} advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the Western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, slave labor <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Mary's mother Molly {{initially}} ran {{the fossil}} business after Richard's death, {{but it is}} unclear how much actual fossil collecting she did herself. As late as 1821, she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> taken up by his apprenticeship to an upholsterer, but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary had assumed the leading role in the family business.|$|E
5|$|Murray's work <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> criticised {{following}} {{her death in}} 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. During these decades, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America– such as Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo– published in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.|$|E

5|$|Piccadilly <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{developed}} {{and by the}} middle of the 18th century it was continuously built on as far as Hyde Park Corner. The development of St James's and Mayfair in particular made Piccadilly into one of the busiest roads in London. Hugh Mason and William Fortnum started the Fortnum & Mason partnership on Piccadilly in 1705, selling recycled candles from Buckingham Palace. By 1788, the store sold poultry, potted meats, lobsters and prawns, savoury patties, Scotch eggs, and fresh and dried fruits.|$|E
5|$|Poe <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{unstable}} {{after his}} wife's death. He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman {{who lived in}} Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. There is also strong evidence that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship. Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Hollywood and Graham; Zelda {{returned to}} the hospital. She nonetheless made progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after admittance, she was released. She was nearing forty now, her friends were long gone, and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Scottish art in {{the eighteenth}} century is the body of visual art made in Scotland, by Scots, or about Scottish subjects, {{in the eighteenth century}}. This period saw {{development}} of professionalisation, with art academies were established in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Art <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> influenced by Neoclassicism, the Enlightenment and {{towards the end of the}} century by Romanticism, with Italy becoming a major centre of Scottish art.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the decade, both Shaws {{began to}} suffer ill health. Charlotte <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{incapacitated}} by Paget's disease of bone, and he developed pernicious anaemia. His treatment, involving injections of concentrated animal liver, was successful, but this breach of his vegetarian creed distressed him and brought down condemnation from militant vegetarians.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
