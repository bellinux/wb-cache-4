500|$|Opening the 2011–12 season, Cammalleri {{scored the}} first NHL regular season goal at the MTS Centre as Montreal spoiled {{the debut of}} the new Winnipeg Jets {{franchise}} with a 5–1 victory. He {{had to leave the}} game, however, after suffering a cut on his leg from the skate blade of teammate Yannick Weber. He struggled throughout {{the first part of the}} season, and with the team also losing, was booed by the fans in Montreal during a 3–0 defeat against the St. Louis Blues. Following the game, he expressed his frustration, quoted as saying: [...] "I can't accept that we will display a losing attitude as we're doing this year. We prepare for our games like losers. We play like losers. So it's no <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> lose." [...] The commentary sparked controversy, while the Montreal Gazette suggested later that the comments, originally spoken in English, were misrepresented after they were translated to French by Réseau des sports then translated back to English.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] is 1 {{minute and}} 59 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of A major. The {{instruments}} used on the track are tuned slightly sharper than standard. The song begins with an intro featuring a lead guitar and keyboard melody, which plays twice, accompanied by a rhythm guitar riff alternating between A and D chords, drums and bass. The track breaks down to just rhythm guitar, drums and bass for the first verse which begins after 13 seconds. The first chorus begins after 23 seconds with a distorted guitar playing the chord sequence D5, C5, B5 and A5 twice while Rhys sings [...] "If we do or die we should try, if we don't try I say bye-bye, and if I say bye-bye, I'll <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> didn't try to do or die" [...] backed by high harmony backing vocals and occasional keyboard noises. The song breaks down again for a second verse before the second chorus enters at 46 seconds. An instrumental passage follows with the lead guitar and keyboard reprising the melody which plays during the intro. The instrumental leads into a double chorus. At the end of the final chorus the track crescendos, with Rhys singing [...] "yeah, yeah, yeah" [...] and all instruments {{with the exception of the}} keyboard coming to an abrupt silence after 1 minute and 43 seconds. Keyboard noises continue and gradually fade out until the track ends.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Terry Rakolta, from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, led {{a boycott}} of the show after viewing the episode [...] "Her Cups Runneth Over". Offended by the images {{of an old man}} wearing a woman's garter and stockings, the scene where Steve touches the pasties of a {{mannequin}} dressed in S gear, a homosexual man wearing a tiara on his head (and Al's line [...] "...and they <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> call them 'queens'"), and a half-nude woman who takes off her bra in front of Al (and is shown with her arms covering her bare chest in the next shot), Rakolta began a letter-writing campaign to advertisers, demanding they boycott the show.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the truly}} pivotal event, Crafton {{points to the}} {{national}} release of the film's sound version in early 1928—he dates it to January, Block and Wilson to February 4. In March, Warners announced that The Jazz Singer was playing at a record 235 theaters (though many could still show it only silently). In May, a consortium including the leading Hollywood studios signed up with Western Electric's licensing division, ERPI, for sound conversion. In July, Warner Bros. released the first all-talking feature, Lights of New York, a musical crime melodrama. On September 27, The Jazz Singer became the first feature-length talking picture to be shown in Europe when it premiered at London's Piccadilly Theatre. The movie [...] "created a sensation", according to British film historian Rachael Low. [...] "The Jazz Singer {{was a turning point}} [...] The Bioscope greeted it with, 'We are inclined to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> ever called them Living Pictures.'" [...] The Paris sound premiere followed in January 1929.|$|E

60|$|Alas! our {{ignorance of}} these things is {{manifest}} by our unwillingness to abide affliction, by our secret murmuring under the hand of God; by our <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are so chastised as we are, by our thinking long that the affliction is no sooner removed.|$|R

6000|$|Leslie {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} as he lit a cigar. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it can't be helped. We must face the thing! And now I don't want to set the others <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> have slipped away; we had better go in again." [...] They walked back info the house.|$|R
5000|$|Of the project, star Bette Davis recalled, [...] "We {{had nothing}} but script trouble. Gary Merrill and I often <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> agreed to make this film after we got started working on it. Emlyn Williams rewrote many scenes for us, which gave it some plausibility, but we never cured the basic ills of the story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They can't see {{us against}} the land, but I've an idea they'll be in soon enough {{to learn the}} steamer didn't pick one of us up," [...] he said.

6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> all torture {{ourselves}} so unnecessarily. It really {{seems as}} if the chief use we made of our reason was to inflict as much pain upon ourselves and upon one another as we possibly could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he observed, [...] "we're here, and I guess any {{man with}} sense enough to prefer whole bones to broken ones would <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are. It's most twelve years since I used {{to head off}} into the Bush this way in Washington." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{said he had}} met a {{good many}} Americans, and liked them, but he couldn't see {{for the life of}} him why they do some things English people don't do, and don't do things English people do do. For instance, he <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> don't drink tea for breakfast. Miss Pondar had made it for him, knowing he'd want it, and he <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> Americans drink coffee when such good tea as that was comes in their reach.|$|R
5000|$|Dominion was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1998 [...] "Coaster of the Year" [...] award, which {{ultimately}} went to Jurassic Park: Trespasser. The editors wrote, [...] "Ion Storm's initial release sailed like a lead balloon, complete with overhyped and ineffectual AI, 1995-era graphics, and a back story {{so bad that}} it had us <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> even briefly stopped playing StarCraft for this." ...|$|R
40|$|Have {{you ever}} <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> eat wheat, rice, {{potatoes}} and cassava? <b>Why</b> <b>we</b> routinely domesticate foodstuffs {{with the power}} to kill us, or <b>why</b> <b>we</b> chose almonds over acorns? Answering all these questions and more in a readable and friendly style, this book takes you on a journey through our history with crop plants.

6000|$|O' course, {{we see it}} all then, and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> hadn't {{thought of}} it afore; and we stood quiet {{listening}} {{to the things that}} Henery Walker said about a man that would go and steal another man's great-uncle from 'im. Three times Smith, the landlord, said, [...] "Hush!" [...] and the fourth time he put Henery Walker outside and told 'im to stay there till he 'ad lost his voice.|$|R
5000|$|Cotton {{supported}} President Donald Trump's 2017 {{executive order}} to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. He stated that “It’s simply wrong {{to call the}} president’s executive order concerning immigration and refugees ‘a religious test’ of any kind. I doubt many Arkansans or Americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terror networks; I think they’re <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> don’t do that already.” ...|$|R
60|$|The fat man {{then took}} his {{seat on the}} Bench, {{of which he was}} chairman, and I {{gathered}} from a bystander that his name was Sir Thomas Ingell, Bart., M.P., of Ingell Park, Huckley. He began with an allocution pitched in a tone that would have justified revolt throughout empires. Evidence, when the crowded little court did not drown it with applause, was given in the pauses of the address. They were all very proud of their Sir Thomas, and looked from him to us, <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> did not applaud too.|$|R
6000|$|Once more Peter nodded. [...] "That's right," [...] said he. [...] "Everybody does love Little Friend. It {{makes me}} feel sort of all glad inside just to hear him sing.

6000|$|... "Forrest," [...] he said abruptly, [...] "it is {{a mistake}} to clear out all the {{servants}} like this.

Don't you think afterwards that they may <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> did it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{depressing}} night and an enervating country," [...] Kenwardine remarked. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> stay here as we do, since we're apt {{to leave it}} as poor as when we came. The people are an unstable lot, and when you've spent your time and energy developing what you hope is a profitable scheme, some change of policy or leaders suddenly cuts it short." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{appeared}} {{that all the}} people in the inn had been watching us from the windows also, <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> stood there looking miserable. If it had not been for this nice old gentleman the fools would have remained watching us, I suppose, for the rest of the afternoon. The landlord excused himself by saying he thought we looked like English. It is no figure of speech. On the Continent they do sincerely believe that every Englishman is mad. They are as convinced of it as is every English peasant that Frenchmen live on frogs. Even when one makes a direct personal effort to disabuse them of the impression one is not always successful.|$|R
5000|$|Gnecco's first {{recording}} titled Sour (1994) was a demo compilation {{which he}} feels {{is not a}} real Ours record, being that he was dissatisfied with much of it. In 2005 he said, [...] "In 1994, I was only 20 years old, and labels with offering record deals to me, but I knew I was too young, that's not where I was going yet. So, I made one demo record with that Ours line-up and then left it; I didn't {{want to be known}} as the ex-singer from those Sour recordings. The band on Sour is not Ours- we were just a bunch of young kids, just messing around. I wasn't allowed to be insane, like I wanted, and I had no patience, and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> felt we had to put it out." [...] A song from this recording entitled [...] "OURS" [...] eventually evolved into the title track of their latest album Mercy.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems in economic policy-making is learning to read the content of current policy. Each of us has probably looked at the sharp peaks or troughs in a time series ot interest rates, the growth rate of money, the index of industrial production or some other measure and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> had so much difficulty interpreting the changes at the time they occurred. Errors of judgment that become apparent with hindsight result frequently from a failure to interpret correctly changes that have already occurred or that are likely to occur because of policy actions already taken. Unaware of the future effect of current or previous actions, policy makers delay action too long, change too abruptly or too much...|$|R
