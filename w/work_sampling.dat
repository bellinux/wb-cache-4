25|$|Productivity is a {{standard}} efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through manufacturing engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: time and motion study, predetermined motion time systems and <b>work</b> <b>sampling.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1883, Frederick Winslow Taylor {{introduced}} the stopwatch method for accurately measuring {{the time to}} perform each single task of a complicated job. He developed {{the scientific study of}} productivity and identifying how to coordinate different tasks to eliminate wasting of time and increase the quality of work. [...] The next generation of scientific study occurred with the development of <b>work</b> <b>sampling</b> and predetermined motion time systems (PMTS). [...] <b>Work</b> <b>sampling</b> is used to measure the random variable associated with the time of each task. [...] PMTS allows the use of standard predetermined tables of the smallest body movements (e.g. turning the left wrist by 90°), and integrating them to predict the time needed to perform a simple task. [...] PMTS has gained substantial importance {{due to the fact that}} it can predict work measurements without observing the actual work. [...] The foundation of PMTS was laid out by the research and development of Frank B. and Lillian M. Gilbreth around 1912. [...] The Gilbreths took advantage of taking motion pictures at known time intervals while operators were performing the given task.|$|E

40|$|The <b>work</b> <b>sample</b> {{method of}} datacollection {{involves}} the system-atic collection and review ofproducts created during the nor-mal course of <b>work.</b> <b>Work</b> <b>samples</b> {{can be written}} documents, such as reports, memos, letters, or journal articles; or tan-gible products, such as a bowl created by a potter, a poster created by a graphic designer, or an educational videotape developed by an instructional designer. <b>Work</b> <b>samples</b> may also include routine recordings of work, such as daily audio-tapes of a customer service representa-tive’s conversations with clients or computer records of a data entry clerk’s output for the day. <b>Work</b> <b>samples</b> are similar to performance tests and observations because all three methods of data collection focus on work products or the directly observable results of work. In performance tests, which are commonly administered in selection, training, or certification situa-tions, people are given tasks to perform that closely simulate tasks performed on the job (Binder, 2004). In observations, data are collected by systematically observing employees as they perform their jobs and documenting their behav-iors (Marrelli, 2005). <b>Work</b> <b>samples</b> are different from perfor-mance tests in that <b>work</b> <b>samples</b> are actual specimens of routine on-the-job work, while performance tests are spe-cially administered for a specific purpose outside the usual job context. Work sam-ples are different from observations in that observations are specifically sched-uled for a set period and are typically of relatively short duration. In contrast, <b>work</b> <b>samples</b> are collected from routine work performed over an extended period. While performance tests and observations both require {{the presence of the}} worker, <b>work</b> <b>samples</b> examine the tangible results of work performance, but the worker is not present during the review of the work...|$|R

40|$|<b>Work</b> <b>sample</b> {{tests have}} been used in applied {{psychology}} for decades as important predictors of job performance, and they have been suggested to be among the most valid predictors of job performance. As we ex-amined classic <b>work</b> <b>sample</b> literature, we found the narrative review by Asher and Sciarrino (1974) to be plagued by many methodological problems. Further, it is possible that data used in this study may have influenced the results (e. g., r =. 54) reported by Hunter and Hunter in their seminal work in 1984. After integrating all of the relevant data, we found an observed mean correlation between <b>work</b> <b>sample</b> tests and measures of job performance of. 26. This value increased to. 33 when measures of job performance (e. g., supervisory ratings) were corrected for attenuation. Our results suggest that the level of the validity for <b>work</b> <b>sample</b> tests may not be as large as previously thought (i. e., approxi-mately one third less than previously thought). Further, our work also summarizes the relationship of <b>work</b> <b>sample</b> exams to measures of gen-eral cognitive ability. We found that <b>work</b> <b>sample</b> tests were associated with an observed correlation of. 32 with tests of general cognitive ability. <b>Work</b> <b>sample</b> tests are generally thought to have a number of very desirable attributes. They are believed to be among the most valid predic-tors of job performance by researchers (Hunter & Hunter, 1984; Reilly & Warech, 1993) and managers (see Terpstra, Kethley, & Foley, 2000). They are also believed by many researchers to have lower levels of standardized ethnic group differences (Cascio, 2003; Schmitt & Mills, 2001) and We thank many researchers for their help in this work.

40|$|Successfully {{implementing}} {{the practice of}} inclusion by differentiating instruction is dependent upon both the skills and attitudes of general education teachers. New general education teachers who are entering the field are particularly vulnerable to the demands and stress of the profession, and exemplary preservice teacher education programs must prepare pre service teachers {{to meet the needs}} of all students by giving them the skills to make appropriate lesson adaptations, accommodations and modifications.

Second, accommodations written into the <b>work</b> <b>sample</b> lessons center around partner or group work. Third, preservice teachers have an undeveloped or inaccurate understanding about special education and its terminology. Fourth, preservice teachers tend to use multiple intelligences and the use ofmanipulatives for differentiation.
