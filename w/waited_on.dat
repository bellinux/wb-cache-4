He served as a page in the household of Charles Paulet (later the Marquess of Winchester and the Duke of Bolton), under whose patronage his career would be advanced. He <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> Paulet's daughter Jane, who married John Egerton, Earl of Bridgewater, another patron who promoted his career.|$|E

5|$|The British had {{witnessed}} the Polish drop but {{were unable to}} make contact by radio so a swimmer was sent south of the Rhine. The British planned to supply rafts for a river crossing that night as the Poles were desperately needed on the northern bank. The Poles <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> the southern bank, but by 03:00 no rafts were evident and they withdrew to Driel to take up defensive positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} purpose {{of much of}} Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era {{before the advent of}} the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> by the house's communal servants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} after the storm, the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{operated}} search and rescue missions, while families <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> the beach. The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims. Due to storm fatalities, 24adults became widows, and 83children lost a father. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter who was {{on a tour of the}} country at the time.|$|E

5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E
5|$|By {{shortly after}} the passage of the storm, the {{government}} of Veracruz opened 6,000emergency storm shelters for impacted citizens. Floodwaters from the rainfall inundated scores of houses and cars, with a total of 7,500families in Veracruz directly affected by the storm. The Mexican Army, combined with the efforts of police officers and state officials, worked with amphibious vehicles to rescue families in flooded houses, of whom many <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> rooftops; according to reports from the Civil Defense of the government of Veracruz, a person drowned in the city of Cerro Azul. Several people were reported missing, as well. Landslides from the flooding cut communications and left 66villages temporarily isolated. Across Veracruz, the most affected localities were Naranjos, Chinampa de Gorostiza, Tamalín, Tantima, Benito Juárez, Tamiahua, and Tempoal de Sánchez. The government of Veracruz {{declared a state of emergency}} for 14 municipalities. Damage in the state totaled over 100million pesos (2005MXN, $9.3million 2005USD, $10.3million 2008USD); the state government requested reconstruction aid amounting to the equivalent of the damage total.|$|E
5|$|Most {{buildings}} in Bath {{are made from}} the local, golden-coloured Bath Stone, and many date from the 18th and 19th century. The dominant style of architecture in Central Bath is Georgian; this style evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. Many of the prominent architects of the day were employed {{in the development of}} the city. The original purpose of much of Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era before the advent of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> by the house's communal servants. The masons Reeves of Bath were prominent in the city from the 1770s to 1860s.|$|E

25|$|From Egypt, a {{contingent}} of about 1,000 people were sent to Medina, with instructions to assassinate Uthman and overthrow the government. Similar contingents marched from Kufa and Basra to Medina. They sent their representatives to Medina to contact the leaders of public opinion. The representatives of the contingent from Egypt <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> Ali, and offered him the Caliphate in succession to Uthman, which Ali turned down. The representatives of the contingent from Kufa <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> Al-Zubayr, while {{the representatives of the}} contingent from Basra <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> Talhah, and offered them their allegiance as the next Caliph, which were both turned down. In proposing alternatives to Uthman as Caliph, the rebels neutralized the bulk of public opinion in Medina and Uthman's faction could no longer offer a united front. Uthman had the active support of the Umayyads, and a few other people in Medina.|$|E

25|$|Casting {{about for}} a good {{position}} to defend, Craig offered to hold the fortress of Gaeta. However, its governor, Prince Louis of Hesse-Philippsthal stubbornly refused to admit his men to the citadel.

Ignoring this slight, Craig got his corps aboard ships on 19 January 1806 and sailed to Messina. The British soldiers <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> their naval transports in harbor until the king and queen finally allowed them to land on 13 February.|$|E

President Lincoln remained near the city, staying with his family at the Soldier's Home in present-day Northeast Washington, yet a steamer <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> the Potomac to evacuate the president if the situation became too dire. Meanwhile, refugees from surrounding counties began to enter the relative safety of the city.|$|E
