Data elements (DEs) in particular {{play an important role}} in data integration. We combine schema- and instance-based approaches to mapping DEs to terminological resources in order to facilitate data sources integration. Methods <b>We</b> extracted <b>DEs</b> from eleven disparate biomedical sources. <b>We</b> compared these <b>DEs</b> to concepts and/or terms in biomedical controlled vocabularies and to reference <b>DEs.</b> <b>We</b> also exploited <b>DE</b> values to disambiguate underspecified DEs and to identify additional mappings. Results 82. 5 % of the 474 DEs studied are mapped to entries of a terminological resource and 74. 7 % of the whole set can be associated with reference DEs. Only 6. 6 % of the DEs had values that could be semantically typed. Conclusion Our study suggests that the integration of biomedical sources can be achieved automatically with limited precision and largely facilitated by mapping DEs to terminological resources. </p...|$|R
