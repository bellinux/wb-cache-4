5|$|The 2nd Virginia Cavalry <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> {{be back at}} winter {{quarters}} in Camp Piatt, Virginia, and believed they had completed their work for the year. On November 22, Colonel Paxton received a surprising order from the new division commander, recently promoted Brigadier General George Crook.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, {{who owned}} a Yiddish theater there, <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden {{completed}} the play he'd started in Paris, Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas ("Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based {{on the life of}} Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an operetta Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E
5|$|A specimen-collecting {{expedition}} {{along the}} Pacific Coast {{and down into}} Mexico provided them {{with a chance to}} relax, and, for Steinbeck, a chance for a brief escape from the controversy mounting around The Grapes of Wrath. Ricketts, suffering {{as a result of the}} breakup of his long-term relationship with a married woman in Monterey, <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> get away too. They planned to collect specimens from the rock and tide pools and the shore line uncovered between tides which would allow them build up a picture of the macro level ecosystem in the Gulf. The preserved specimens of the fauna they collected could be identified and catalogued or sold on their return.|$|E

5|$|Grace {{comments}} {{in his memoirs}} that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> make his hundredth century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Although having reached legal {{retirement}} age in 1927, and thus unable {{to be offered}} another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed {{on an annual basis}} each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.|$|E

60|$|But two {{or three}} hours' ride in the hot sun, on a mule's back, indisposes one to make much of the grandest scenes, insomuch that we <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> go to sleep; and on awaking we <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> get some dinner, such as it was.|$|R

5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which meant he was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E
5|$|With {{the aid of}} a small sum {{of money}} from his distant {{relative}} the Chief Rabbi, Adler got together the money to travel by steerage to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the charms of both Dinah and Jennya.|$|E
5|$|Marley and Neville Livingston (later {{known as}} Bunny Wailer) had been {{childhood}} friends in Nine Mile. They {{had started to}} play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. Marley left Nine Mile with his mother when he was 12 and moved to Trenchtown, Kingston. Cedella Booker and Thadeus Livingston (Bunny Wailer's father) had a daughter together whom they named Claudette Pearl, who was a younger sister to both Bob and Bunny. Now that Marley and Livingston were living {{together in the same}} house in Trenchtown, their musical explorations deepened to include the latest R from American radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica, and the new Ska music. The move to Trenchtown was proving to be fortuitous, and Marley soon found himself in a vocal group with Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Beverley Kelso and Junior Braithwaite. Joe Higgs, who was part of the successful vocal act Higgs and Wilson, resided on 3rd St., and his singing partner Roy Wilson had been raised by the grandmother of Junior Braithwaite. Higgs and Wilson would rehearse {{at the back of the}} houses between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and it wasn't long before Marley (now residing on 2nd St), Junior Braithwaite and the others were congregating around this successful duo. Marley and the others didn't play any instruments at this time, and were more interested in being a vocal harmony group. Higgs <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> help them develop their vocal harmonies, although more importantly, he had started to teach Marley how to play guitar—thereby creating the bedrock that would later allow Marley to construct some of the biggest-selling reggae songs in the history of the genre.|$|E

5|$|On 12November 1945, at {{the first}} general meeting of army leadership, General Sudirman– {{the leader of the}} Fifth Division in Purwokerto, who had two years {{military}} experience and was 23 years younger than Oerip– was elected leader of the army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional commanders from Sumatra, who had voted unanimously, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour; Oerip had lost votes because some of the division leaders distrusted his history with the KNIL and the oath he had taken to the Dutch motherland upon graduation. Although Sudirman was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, the meeting did not allow it; Oerip himself <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> no longer {{be in charge of the}} army. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to serve as chief of staff under him. While Sudirman remained unconfirmed, Oerip remained de jure leader; however, the Indonesian journalist Salim Said writes that Oerip's orders were at times unintelligible owing to the leader's poor command of Indonesian and often ignored unless approved by Sudirman.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Rumford invited Governor Earl Warren {{to address}} the {{national}} convention of Alpha Phi Alpha, held in Berkeley. Despite illness and torrential rain, Warren <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> make the speech and meet those convened.|$|E
25|$|However, not {{all members}} of the royal family were {{dissatisfied}} with Peter's mesalliance and subsequent loss of dynastic rights. His aunt, Princess Andrew, <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see him excluded from the line of succession because it brought her own son, Prince Philip (later Duke of Edinburgh), closer to the throne.|$|E

25|$|In late 2010 {{although}} there were doubts of a new contract between Najwa and Rotana Production Company, after several meetings with Salem El Hendi, Najwa agreed to return to Rotana.

25|$|With {{the help}} of Bathory, however, the scales soon turned in the {{opposite}} direction. Six months after his humiliating peace with the Polish monarch, Ivan IV <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> conclude a truce with Sweden also on a uti possidetis basis at Plussa, on August 5, 1582. The war was resumed by Russians {{as soon as the}} truce expired, leading to the Treaty of Tyavzino, far less advantageous for Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Ewbank {{moved back}} to Oxford in {{retirement}} and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, many blacks {{migrated}} to St. Louis from the Deep South for its industrial jobs. Delaney met with new arrivals to try to track down her father.

Their father <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see them, but, with his wife Polly dead by then, he returned to Mississippi and his friends of 45 years.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be back as {{he put on his}} old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} {{presented}} to Maurice of Nassau, who <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> give its approval and then ordered the operation the go ahead but in maximum secrecy. On the 25th of February Charles de Heraugiere was to lead the covert assault in charge of sixty eight hand picked Dutch and English soldiers. They waited next {{to the mouth of}} the Mark river for the arrival of the boat of Adriaen van Bergen and accompanied captains Logier, Fervet and Lieutenant Matthew Held. That same day Maurice of Nassau, Francis Vere and Count Hohenlohe with 800 Dutch and 600 English soldiers with 300 of cavalry arrived at Willemstad, thirty kilometers from Breda. There they would {{have to wait for the}} warning of Heraugiere if all had gone well.|$|E
