40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} analysis of contact patch length-rolling resistance, contact patch width-rolling resistance and tire deflection-rolling resistance at different <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> and inflation pressure levels is presented. The experiments were planned in a randomized block design and {{were conducted in}} the controlled conditions provided by a soil bin environment utilizing a well-equipped single wheel-tester of Urmia University, Iran. The image processing technique was used for determination of the contact patch length and contact patch width. Analysis of covariance {{was used to evaluate}} the correlations. The highest values of contact length and width and tire deflection occurred at the highest <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> and lowest tire inflation pressure. Contact patch width is a polynomial (order 2) function of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> while there is a linear relationship between tire contact length and <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> as well as between tire deflection and <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> Correlations were developed for the evaluation of contact patch length-rolling resistance, contact patch width-rolling resistance and tire deflection-rolling resistance.

To this end, the current study focuses on <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> management with the aim to establish <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> monitoring and mitigation actions (in terms of limits on allowable wheel defects) that minimize traffic disruptions. As a first step, the relation between <b>wheel</b> impact <b>load</b> magnitudes (resulting from the out-of-round wheels) and critical rail crack sizes {{that would result in}} rail breaks is established. Variations in parameters such as track stiffness, rail temperature, impact load characteristics and hanging sleepers etc. are investigated and a “bad case scenario” that implies severe, but realistic operational conditions is established. In this manner allowable <b>wheel</b> impact <b>load</b> magnitudes can be linked to pertinent critical crack sizes that must be identified during inspections. An interesting finding is that thermal stresses have such a major effect that a seasonal variation in allowable <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> limit seems justified. Predicted critical crack sizes (presuming allowed <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> magnitudes) are then contrasted to critical crack sizes at operational rail breaks. A large scatter in operational critical crack sizes is found and reasons for this fact are discussed. Finally operational aspects of implementing the suggested limit values are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractVehicle imposed soil {{compaction}} {{is one of}} the serious concerns in agriculture and environmental problems that requires accurate studies. We were inspired to launch an investigation for {{soil compaction}} determination at three levels of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> (1, 2 and 3 kN), three levels of velocity (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 m/s) and at 1, 2 and 3 passages of wheel with three replications on clay-loam soil. Experiments were conducted utilizing a single wheel-tester inside a soil bin. Penetration resistance and soil sinkage were determined as soil compaction indices. Data were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at. % 1 significance level. Results indicated that the highest penetration resistance of 260 kPa occurred at a depth of 210 mm, third pass, <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> of 3 kN and velocity of 0. 5 m/s.

Findings disclosed that augmentation of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> and multiple pass increased soil compaction while the increase of velocity had a reverse effect.

40|$|A {{pavement}} strength {{rating system}} is internationally adopted {{in order to}} protect aircraft pavements from inadvertent overload. The system has two elements. The primary element is designed to protect the pavement against subgrade rutting and the second is intended to protect asphalt pavement surfaces. The surface-protection element is arbitrary and empirical, placing category-based limits on aircraft tyre pressures. In 2008, increases in the tyre pressure limits were proposed by aircraft manufacturers and these were approved in 2013. The research reported in this paper assesses the impact of tyre pressure and individual <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> increases on calculated flexible pavement stress indicators, as well as identifying an improved surface layer protection element. Stresses were calculated near the surface, at the surface layer interface and at the subgrade. Tyre pressure and <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> combinations included current (18 t and 1. 35 MPa), imminent (33 t and 1. 75 MPa) and future (40 t and 2. 15 MPa) aircraft. Surface layer stress increased significantly (20 – 30 %) with increases in both tyre pressure and <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> The subgrade stress increased near-equally (97 %) with <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> but was insensitive (< 1 %) to tyre pressure changes. The ability of the current aircraft pavement strength rating system to protect pavements from the increasing demands of aircraft was demonstrated to be limited to the subgrade. It is recommended that the tyre pressure rating be amended to reflect the combined impact of both tyre pressure rating and individual <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> It is also recommended that ongoing efforts to incorporate additional asphalt surface failure modes into routine pavement design be given high priority. The importance of these issues is reinforced by the limited availability of remedies to counter any negative impacts of increased surface layer stresses, especially in hot climates. © 2016 Taylor & Franci...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s in the Soviet Union curve {{resistance}} {{was found by}} experiment [...] to be highly dependent on both the velocity and the banking of the curve, also known as superelevation or cant, as can bee seen in the graph above. If a train car rounds a curve at balancing speed such that the component of centrifugal force in the lateral direction (towards {{the outside of the}} curve and parallel with the plane of the track) is equal to the component of gravitational force in the opposite direction there is very little curve resistance. At such balancing speed there is zero cant deficiency and results in a frictionless banked turn. But deviate from this speed (either higher or lower) and the curve resistance increases due to the unbalance in forces which tends to pull the vehicle sideways (and would be felt by a passenger in a passenger train). Note that for empty rail cars (low <b>wheel</b> <b>loads)</b> the specific curve resistance is higher, similar to the phenomena of higher rolling resistance for empty cars on a straight track.|$|E
