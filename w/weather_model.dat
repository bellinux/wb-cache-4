500|$|The {{output of}} {{forecast}} models based on atmospheric dynamics {{is unable to}} resolve some details of the weather near the Earth's surface. As such, a statistical relationship between the output of a numerical <b>weather</b> <b>model</b> and the ensuing conditions at the ground {{was developed in the}} 1970s and 1980s, known as model output statistics (MOS). [...] Starting in the 1990s, model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible.|$|E
500|$|Because {{forecast}} models {{based upon}} the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near the ground, statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem. Statistical models were created {{based upon the}} three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations, and the climatological conditions for specific locations. [...] These statistical models are collectively referred to as model output statistics (MOS), and were developed by the National Weather Service for their suite of weather forecasting models by 1976. [...] The United States Air Force developed {{its own set of}} MOS based upon their dynamical <b>weather</b> <b>model</b> by 1983.|$|E

[...] Physics includes wave field refraction, nonlinear resonant interactions, sub-grid representations of unresolved islands, and dynamically updated ice coverage.

40|$|The {{field of}} project {{management}} has originated from {{the domain of}} operational research, which focuses on the mathematical optimization of operational problems. However, in recent decades an increasingly broad perspective {{has been applied to}} the field of project management. As such, project management has spawned a number of very active sub- domains, which focus not solely on the scheduling of the project’s baseline, but also on the analysis of risk, as well as the controlling of project execution. This dissertation focuses on two areas where existing literature is still lacking. The first area is the use of incentivised contractual agreements between the owner of a project, and the contractor who is hired to execute the project. Whereas this area has received growing attention in recent years, the majority of studies remained strongly descriptive. Hence, the aim of {{the first part of this}} dissertation is to develop a more prescriptive approach from both the owner’s and the contractor’s perspective. The second part of this dissertation investigates the use of dedicated <b>weather</b> <b>models</b> to improve operational performance of weather-sensitive projects. During recent decades, significant effort has been made to improve the quality of <b>weather</b> simulation <b>models.</b> Moreover, the amount of available weather data has been steadily increasing. This opens up a lot of new possibilities for using more precise <b>weather</b> <b>models</b> in order to support operational decision making. In spite of this, the number of applications of these <b>weather</b> <b>models</b> in operational research has remained rather limited. As such, the aim of the second part of this dissertation is to leverage these <b>weather</b> <b>models</b> to improve the scheduling of offshore construction projects, as well as preventive maintenance of offshore wind turbines...|$|R

5000|$|After 2 {{years as}} a postdoc in Denmark, Daley took a {{position}} at the numerical weather prediction research center in Montreal where he {{was instrumental in the}} development of the first operational <b>weather</b> <b>model</b> (implemented in 1976) based on the spectral transform method for the globe.

50|$|Ironically, earlier {{forecasts}} as {{far back}} as the preceding weekend had correctly identified that gale force winds would affect Southern England. However, later runs of the model had indicated a more southerly track for the low pressure system, incorrectly indicating that the strongest winds would be confined to Northern and Central France. The French meteorological office used a different computer <b>weather</b> <b>model</b> to the British, and the French model proved more accurate in predicting the severity of the storm in the Channel.|$|E

50|$|Lorenz built a {{mathematical}} model of the way air moves around in the atmosphere.

Minute variations in the initial values of variables in his twelve-variable computer <b>weather</b> <b>model</b> (c. 1960, running on an LGP-30 desk computer) would result in grossly divergent weather patterns. This sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which {{came to be known as}} the butterfly effect, meant that weather predictions from more than about a week out are generally fairly inaccurate.|$|E
