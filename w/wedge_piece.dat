Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Modern uses of rotating shafts depend upon bearing speeds and temperatures that exceed normal operating parameters. In order to accommodate these excessive parameters, magnetic bearings have replaced ball or thrust bearings. However, eddy currents cause a loss of power and instability in magnetic bearings. The eddy current magnitude is responsible for the power loss, while the phase lag between the magnetic field and the input or control current causes the instability. This study incorporated finite element studies of magnetic thrust bearings using static bench testing procedures to investigate configurations that promote eddy current reduction. Several rotor/stator configurations, including solid metal, laminated washers, tapewound lam-inates. and solid <b>wedge</b> <b>pieces</b> are used to determine the smallest phase lag configuration. Finite element analysis will compare a solid configuration bench test with an axisymmetric finite element model and illustrate the fringing effect that occurs with magnetic bearings. A fringe factor accounting for the effect caused by extending the rotor past the stator is developed using finite element analysis...|$|R

Now, it is recognized {{how important it is}} to get to know the characteristic of the wood produced by this vegetation. Thus, this study aims to provide information on the physicochemical and energetic characteristics of wood, carbonization yields and characterization of the charcoal from wood of Poincianella pyramidalis Tul. L. P. Queiroz and Handroanthus impertiginosus (Mart. ex DC.) Mattos. To meet the goal five trees from each species were cut down and randomly sample at Santa Barbara Farm, located in the municipality of São Mamede-PB. The trees were properly identified and transported to the Department of Forest Products Technology (STPF) at the Federal University of Campina Grande. Thirty centimeters sections were removed from each tree at 0 (base), 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the commercial height (trunk diameter > 5 cm). A 2. 5 cm thick disc was removed from the median part of each 30 cm section, and each disc was subdivided in four <b>wedge</b> <b>pieces,</b> passing through the trunk pith. Two opposite <b>wedge</b> <b>pieces</b> were used to determine the basic density of wood, ant the other two pieces were put aside in order to carry out physical, chemical and energetic analyses, carbonization yields andcharacterization of the charcoal produced by the studied species. Basic density was determined according to the method of hydrostatic balance and to determine the average basic density of eachtree, the volume between sections of each disc was used as a weighting factor. After the air drying, thesamples intended for chemical analysis were transformed into sawdust and quantitative determinations of total extractiveswere performed, lignin, ashes, and the holocellulose content was estimated by difference. The samples intended for carbonization were processed into chips, and carbonized in an electric oven (furnace) for 5 h 30 mim. Determinations of the yield of products of carbonization were carried out as well as physical and chemical properties of wood charcoal. In general, the studied wood showed similar physical characteristics. Regarding to chemical properties, Pau-d¿arco wood showed a higher lignin content (28. 40 %), and there were not any significant differences among species for the holocellulose content The superior calorific power of Catingueira wood (4413. 50 kcal. kg- 1) showed the lowest values for wood (4413. 50 kcal. kg- 1) and charcoal (6247. 80 kcal. kg- 1) respectively. The catingueira wood showed a higher charcoal yield (43. 03 %), but lower quality. The Pau-d¿arco charcoal had the highest fixed carbon content (67. 68 %). These species showed similar charcoal true density and fixed carbon production. It is concluded that the two species which occurs in the Northeastern semiarid, have good properties for charcoal production. The Pau-d'arco showed the best properties for energy use...|$|R

There are three archaeological horizons evident of human occupation located within a one-meter thick alluvial, colluvial, and lacustrine sediments overlying a pedestal of bedrock. These are dated within 14,510, and 13,500-13,000 RCYBP. The oldest horizon is dated to 14,510 + 80 RCYBP (Beta-117541) {{by the presence of}} a tibia bone tool from a musk ox that was AMS radiocarbon dated. [...] Evidence for the butchering/cooking of a mastodon was found in this level. It is believed that one individual was represented. Seven complete or partial ribs, two fragments of limb bones, one tooth, and nine pieces of tusk, all of these display alike surface characteristics lacking signs of fluvial abrasion or extensive subaerial weathering. Evidence that this mastodon was processed and cooked includes the presence of two sandstone knives with worked edges that were used to cut meat and/ or remove hide. A concretion representing a congealed mass of viscous fluid replaced by minerals, may represent fat drippings produced by cooking with fire. Fire cracked rocks and a burned mastodon tooth were also found. Also associated were a triangular stone used as a hand held ax or <b>wedge,</b> a <b>piece</b> of exotic chert used as wedge chert flake, and two pieces of bone modified by human agency. The first of these is an incised basicranial complex of a midsized herbivore, and possible tibia bone tool AMS dated back to 14, 510 RCYBP which suggests a Pre Clovis occupation. It was from the shaft of a right tibia of what was assumed to be a midsized adult musk-ox since it was too gracile to belong to a bison with identification also based on surface details, absolute size, elongative nature, and the presence of other musk-oxen bone and teeth. It measured 195.2 mm in length, 48.9mm in maximum width across the proximal end of the medial surface, 36 mm in peak width in transverse (medial-lateral) section. The tibia bone exhibits three pairs of parallel fractures, two percussion fracture cone in the medullary cavity, and extensive non-random patterned wear. The fractures could have either occurred with one or numerous blow with the goal of obtaining marrow. The wear pattern indicates that the bone tool was used as a scraper or flesher, and might have been used as meat or hide splitter.|$|R

Azim also does well {{for the first half of}} the course, but becomes flustered and gives up after being unable to effectively make a reverse turn at the bottom of the track. Diane and Dallas are the final pair, and Diane's run is good for the most part, but she goes too fast near the end and takes out a significant number of styrofoam obstacles. Dallas is another driver who insists on only using her wing mirrors, and while she does eventually complete the course, she demolishes a significant portion of it.|$|R
