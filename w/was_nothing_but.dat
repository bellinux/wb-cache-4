5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children {{had a crush on}} Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the school}} {{concerned}} with ideological differences, another theory seeks clarification in externalization of the Spanish case; instead of pointing to unique Spanish character of Carlism, it highlights general European patterns of change. With ultramontanism gaining upper hand over more conciliatory political incarnations of Catholicism after the First Vatican Council, {{and with the}} new approach made popular in the neighboring France by Louis Veuillot, the 1888 schism <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a local Spanish manifestation of the trend. Defining the nascent Integrism as religious particularism striving for hegemony, this theory enjoys rather limited popularity.|$|E

25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{caused the}} sand under Port Royal to liquefy and flow out into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two feet down before the impact, {{and the town}} was built on a layer of some 65 feet of water-saturated sand. This type of area did not provide a solid foundation {{on which to build}} an entire town. Unlike the Spanish before them, the English had decided to settle and develop the small area of land, even while acknowledging that the area <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> “hot loose sand”.|$|E

The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues {{that if he could}} get the patent for $25million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted {{to sell the}} patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.|$|E
25|$|Flight of the Migrator {{continues}} {{the story of}} the final living human being, the colonist on Mars, and his decision to go even further back in time. Using the Dream Sequencer machine, he travels {{all the way back to}} just before the Universe was formed, theoretically before the Big Bang, when there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> chaos. The colonist observes the creation of the very first soul, known as the Universal Migrator. It is from this soul that all others are formed, through a division of the original soul. Each resulting soul then travels off into the Universe to bring life in some form to the planet they inhabit.|$|E

25|$|The {{time came}} when {{she chose to}} do a self-{{portrait}}. Again, she took her time working on every detail but the face. Just before the time arrived for her to begin working {{on the face of}} her self-portrait, she fell ill. She was rushed to the infirmary, but they could find nothing wrong with her. She mysteriously died with her portrait unfinished. Not long after her death, the sightings began. Another Sister heard sobbing coming from the room that held the unfinished painting. Curious, the Sister entered the room and saw the back of a nun crying in front of the portrait. When the Sister went to comfort the sobbing nun, she turned and saw there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> darkness where the woman's face should have been. Sightings persisted time and again from a number of different sources.|$|E
25|$|In {{this short}} story, {{a man named}} Gunnar was {{suspected}} of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar {{if he had not}} promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008, Chessman {{made a move}} to {{seemingly}} unite {{with his}} former stable the Black Family, but double-crossed them instead. Chessman turned to the Psycho Circus and together they won the National Atómicos Titles from the Black Family. Chessman's third run with the Atómicos titles ended after just 16 days when AAA Commissioner Vampiro stripped Chessman and the Psycho Circus of the titles after they had attacked him the previous night. The feud with the Black Family continued into 2009 until Chessman segued into a feud with the new AAA World Champion El Mesias. The Feud with El Mesias started during a television taping where Chessman and El Mesias faced off in a match, the match got so out of hand that Chessman ended up being thrown {{over the side of}} the balcony and through a stack of tables. The show went to commercial with Chessman looking seriously injured as he received medical treatment. The following week another singles match between the two was scheduled but Chessman came out on crutches wearing a neck brace. Just as El Mesias thought Chessman was going to announce that he was too injured to wrestle Chessman attacked him with a crutch revealing that the injury <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a ruse to give Chessman an advantage. At Rey de Reyes (2009) Chessman challenged El Mesias for the AAA Mega title inside a Steel Cage but lost.|$|E

25|$|Iranians {{immediately}} {{sought to}} strengthen their position and finally subject the rebellious Kingdoms of Eastern Georgia and making them integral parts of the empire. During the next 150 years as Persian subjects, various Georgian kings and nobles rose into rebellion, while at many other times political activity <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> dormant, and many kings and aristocrats fully accepted Persian overlordship and converted to Islam as well, for greater boons from their Iranian Shahs. On the maternal side of the Safavid (also Qajar) and the Ottoman Turkish dynasty, many members were from Georgian aristocratic or different lines. In the early 17th century Shah Abbas I made a punitive campaign into his Georgian territories after being informed that Teimuraz I of Kakheti {{with a couple of}} Christian citizens assaulted the Karabakh governor and killed him. Shah Abbas decided to confront him but Teimuraz I fled to Georgia towards Ahmed I, in order to shelter from Safavid forces. This event brought an end to the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha signed between the Ottomans and the Safavids. In 1616, Abbas I dispatched his troops to Georgia. He aimed to suppress the Georgian revolt in Tbilisi, however the Safavid soldiers met heavy resistance by the citizens of Tbilisi. Enraged, Shah Abbas ordered a massacre of the public. A large number of Georgian soldiers and people were killed and as many as between 130,000 and 200,000 Georgians from Kakheti were deported to Persia. During the same conflict, Teimuraz sent the Queen mother, Ketevan, as a negotiator to Abbas, but in an act of revenge for the recalcitrance of Teimuraz, he ordered the queen to renounce Christianity, and upon her refusal, had her tortured to death. By the 17th century, both eastern and western Georgia had sunk into poverty {{as the result of the}} constant warfare. The economy was so bad that barter replaced the use of money and the populations of the cities declined markedly. The French traveller Jean Chardin, who visited the region of Mingrelia in 1671, noted the wretchedness of the peasants, the arrogance of the nobles and the ignorance of the clergy. The various rulers in Georgia were thus often split between acknowledging Ottoman or Iranian overlordship (which often entailed nominal conversion to Islam) or making a bid for independence. The emergence of a third imperial power to the north, Christian Russia, made the latter an increasingly tempting choice.|$|E
500|$|Generally, fans {{reacted with}} {{confusion}} {{as to why}} the short existed. Bill Oakley and several other writers loved the short so much that they wanted to do more, but time limitations prevented them. As a result, Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to produce an entire episode that <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> loosely associated shorts, which became the season seven episode [...] "22 Short Films about Springfield". The Flanders/Lovejoy segment of that episode was written by David X. Cohen. [...] "22 Short Films about Springfield" [...] in turn inspired the Futurama episode [...] "Three Hundred Big Boys".|$|E

He described the glass cylinder addition as a [...] "beacon", and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics.

500|$|About Amalric's son Baldwin IV, however, [...] "there was no ambiguity". Baldwin <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> heroic in {{the face}} of his {{debilitating}} leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to gloss over campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders. William's history can be seen as an apologia, a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin's rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.|$|E
