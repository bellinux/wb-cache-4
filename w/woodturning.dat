2500|$|Banksia wood is reddish {{in color}} with an {{attractive}} grain {{but it is}} rarely used as it warps badly on drying. [...] It is occasionally used for ornamental purposes in wood turning and cabinet paneling. It has also been used to make keels for small boats. Historically, the wood of certain species such as B. serrata was used for yokes and boat parts. The large [...] "cones" [...] or seed pods of B.grandis are used for <b>woodturning</b> projects. They are also sliced up and sold as drink coasters; these are generally marketed as souvenirs for international tourists. [...] Woodturners throughout the world value Banksia pods for making ornamental objects.|$|E

Among his notable early achievements was {{the introduction of the}} aesthetic of Asian ceramics into American <b>woodturning.</b> Along with his father, wood turning pioneer Mel Lindquist, he also developed new tools and techniques that expanded the vocabulary of <b>woodturning,</b> and pioneered the use of spalted wood. In the early 1980s, he applied techniques he had developed for large-scale <b>woodturning</b> to create his massive, textured [...] "Totemic Series Sculptures," [...] in the Modernist tradition of Brâncuși.|$|E

The first symposium was held in Lexington, Kentucky in 1987. The symposium will be in Kansas City in 2017 and Portland in 2018. The gathering typically includes live presentations, an auction of selected woodturnings, an instant gallery that showcases current <b>woodturning</b> craft, a rotation of how-to and hands-on demonstrations, the world's largest trade show of commercial <b>woodturning</b> vendors, and a youth training center.|$|E

50|$|<b>Woodturning</b> {{and metal}} {{spinning}} lathes {{do not have}} cross-slides, but rather have banjos, which are flat pieces that sit crosswise on the bed. The position of a banjo can be adjusted by hand; no gearing is involved. Ascending vertically from the banjo is a tool-post, {{at the top of}} which is a horizontal tool-rest. In <b>woodturning,</b> hand tools are braced against the tool rest and levered into the workpiece. In metal spinning, the further pin ascends vertically from the tool rest and serves as a fulcrum against which tools may be levered into the workpiece.|$|E

5000|$|Mel Lindquist (born Melvin Benjamin Lindquist, July 5, 1911 - November 24, 2000) was an {{engineer}} and renowned pioneer of the American Studio Wood Turning movement. Foundational to the studio <b>woodturning</b> movement, Mel Lindquist applied his master machinist techniques and background in engineering, pioneering hollowing techniques called [...] "blind boring", or [...] "blind turning", widely used today. Mel Lindquist discovered spalted wood on his land in the upstate New York Adirondacks in the 1950s and together with his son Mark Lindquist, popularized its use as a material for <b>woodturning</b> and woodworking. Mel Lindquist is widely credited as being the first to seriously explore the use of spalted wood for wood turning, and his son Mark wrote groundbreaking essays in journals of the 1970s. The effect was widespread according to Fine Woodworking: [...] "...Melvin and Mark Lindquist unleashed spalted wood upon the world...." [...] In addition to his numerous technical innovations, Mel Lindquist is also widely credited for developing an aesthetic foundation for the studio <b>woodturning</b> movement based on translating ancient ceramic ideals into the medium of wood, incorporating bark inclusions and imperfections as decorative elements within the turning integral to design. In 1981, Mel and his son Mark initiated the wood turning program at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts,TN, and in October 1985, Mel won the first award honoring the pillars of the studio <b>woodturning</b> movement at the national conference: Woodturning: Vision and Concept at Arrowmont School, TN.|$|E
50|$|This {{evergreen}} {{grows up}} to 4 to 5 meters tall and has thick, leathery oval leaves. The flowers {{have not been}} described in the literature. The heartwood is red in color and is suitable for <b>woodturning.</b>|$|E
50|$|The wood {{is popular}} in {{segmented}} <b>woodturning</b> {{because of its}} dimensional stability and color contrast when mixed with lighter woods such as maple. This makes it especially sought after {{in the manufacture of}} high-end wood canes.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, woodturners in England worked in Turning Shops, usually within the master-apprentice system. In Germany and Russia, <b>woodturning</b> was {{concentrated}} in villages {{which had a}} specialty, such as turning toys. Bow lathes and pole lathes continued in use for decentralized, one-man production of architectural elements and bowls {{in many parts of}} the world. In the US, <b>woodturning</b> was part of the curriculum of industrial arts taught in public schools—often a prerequisite for classes in building furniture. The 'problems' from textbooks included both tool management skills, and assignments to turn objects such as gavels, darning eggs, boxes, trays, candlesticks, lamps, and legs for furniture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Woodturning</b> is {{the craft}} of using the wood lathe with {{hand-held}} tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation. Like the potter's wheel, the wood lathe is a simple mechanism which can generate a variety of forms. The operator {{is known as a}} turner, and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery. In pre-industrial England, these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie' of the turners guild. The skills to use the tools by hand, without a fixed point of contact with the wood, distinguish <b>woodturning</b> and the wood lathe from the machinists lathe, or metal-working lathe.|$|E
50|$|The timber from false {{sandalwood}} is {{suited for}} <b>woodturning,</b> {{although it is}} very hard, and it retains a pleasant scent for a long time, even after sealing. Its oil content allows it to be polished to a high gloss.|$|E
50|$|<b>Woodturning</b> {{skills were}} used by patternmakers {{in the making of}} prototypes and shapes for casting molds used in {{foundries}} during the 19th and 20th century. They worked very slowly to achieve precision, using enormous patternmaker lathes and slow-cutting scraping tools.|$|E
5000|$|Baphia nitida (camwood, also barwood), {{also known}} as African sandalwood, is a shrubby, leguminous., hard-wooded tree from central west Africa. This wood is of a very fine colour, and is used in <b>woodturning</b> for making knife handles and similar articles.|$|E
50|$|High {{speed steel}} tools {{are the most}} popular for use in <b>woodturning,</b> as the speed of {{movement}} of the work past the edge is relatively high for handheld tools, and HSS holds its edge far longer than high carbon steel tools can.|$|E
50|$|The hard, reddish-brown wood (cherry wood) {{is valued}} as a {{hardwood}} for <b>woodturning,</b> and making cabinets and musical instruments. Cherry wood {{is also used}} for smoking foods, particularly meats, in North America, as it lends a distinct and pleasant flavor to the product.|$|E
