5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E

The idol and Grabhgriya in the Brahma-pada (the {{center of}} the temple), under the main spire, serves as a focal point (darsana, a sight) in a Hindu temple. In larger temples, the central space {{typically}} is surrounded by an ambulatory for the devotee to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> ritually circumambulate the Purusa (Brahman), the universal essence.|$|E

500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's room just so they can say that they saw me pee." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{was voted}} the National Football League Players Association NFC Offensive Lineman {{of the year}} four times—1983, 1986, 1987, and 1989 and was the Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award winner after the 1995 season. Slater played in 259 games from 1976 to 1995, a then-record for {{offensive}} lineman (broken by Bruce Matthews in the 1999 season). He was {{the first player to}} play 20 seasons for one team, later matched by Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell Green and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson and third all-time. He played for 24 quarterbacks and 37 running backs in his lengthy career, during which seven running backs reached for over 1,000 yards in a season and played in seven Pro Bowls. Former teammate Jim Everett stated [...] "Jackie Slater is proof they were playing football in the prehistoric days". [...] He was Dickerson's Hall of Fame presenter in 1999. In 2001, Slater was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon hearing his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, fellow inductee and teammate Jack Youngblood said [...] "Jackie Slater didn't want to just beat you, he wanted to dominate you. That's what made him the player that he was." [...] On being honored, Slater stated [...] "As you <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> shake hands with some of the greatest players in history, it finally hits you, that you belong. You're a part of the greatest roster ever assembled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dancers {{continually}} {{interact with}} the customers in the club. [...] They <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the club floor {{to find the most}} lucrative customer to greet. [...] The dancer qualifies a customer by sizing up their appearance and personal characteristics. [...] Once the dancer identifies a suitable customer, she approaches, and attempts to establish a social relationship. [...] Interaction can also be initiated by customers. [...] Clubs generate revenue by cover charges, selling drinks, and other means. [...] Dancers make most of their income from giving lap dances or VIP dances, where regulations allow. [...] Otherwise, customer tips, at the stage, are a dancer's primary form of income. Dancers are entertaining the customers in exchange for money and employing all of the resources at their disposal to do so. [...] They sell the fantasy of sex, but do not typically follow through with the act.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians <b>walk</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{initially}} hesitant, Abrams {{warmed to}} the idea {{on the condition that}} the series would have a supernatural angle to it and if he had a writing partner. ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias. Together, Abrams and Lindelof created the series' style and characters and also wrote a series bible that conceived and detailed the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal four-to-five-season run for the show. The novel idea of a story arc spanning several years was inspired by Babylon 5. Because ABC felt that Alias was too serialized, Lindelof and Abrams assured the network in the bible that the show would be self-contained: [...] "We promise ... that [...] requires NO knowledge of the episode(s) that preceded it ... there is no 'Ultimate Mystery' which requires solving." [...] While such statements contradicted their true plans, the ruse succeeded in persuading ABC to purchase the show. The game Myst, also set in a tropical island, was noted as an influence by Lindelof, as in its narrative, [...] "No one told you what the rules were. You just had to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> explore these environments and gradually a story was told." ...|$|E
2500|$|Assuming this {{hypothetical}} planet had a low {{orbital inclination}} {{with respect to}} the mutual orbit of Alpha CentauriA and B, then the secondary star would start beside the primary at [...] "stellar" [...] conjunction. Half the period later, at [...] "stellar" [...] opposition, both stars would be opposite each other in the sky. As a net result, both the local sun and the other star would each be in the sky for half a day, like Sun and Moon are both above the horizon for half a day. But during stellar conjunction, the other star being [...] "new" [...] would be in the sky during daytime, while during the opposition, the other star being [...] "full" [...] would be in the sky for the whole night. In an Earth-like atmosphere, the light of the other star would be appreciably scattered, causing the sky to be perceptibly blue though darker than during daytime, like during twilight or total solar eclipse. Humans could easily <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> clearly see the surrounding terrain, and reading a book would be quite possible without any artificial light. Over the following half period, the secondary star would be in the sky for a progressively decreasing part of the night (and an increasing part of the day) until at the next conjunction the secondary star would only be in the sky during daytime near the primary star.|$|E

But they were so thin that I found that any breeze would blow them over and scatter them dreadfully; so Glinda found this lonely place for me, where few people ever come. She built the wall to keep any wind from blowing away my people, and told me I could build a paper village here and be its Queen. That is why I came here and settled down to work and started the village you now see.

They made my Fort Worth clothes {{carpenter}} look like a dealer in horse blankets and gee strings. And then the table was all pompous with flowers, and there was a whole kit of tools laid out beside everybody's plate. You'd have thought you was fixed out to burglarize a restaurant before you could get your grub. But I'd been in New York over a week then, and I was getting on to stylish ways. I kind of trailed behind and watched the others use the hardware supplies, and then I tackled the chuck with the same weapons. It ain't much trouble to travel with the high-flyers after you find out their gait. I got along fine.
