5|$|After {{years of}} {{planning}} and a year of construction, WhiteWater World {{opened to the public}} on 8 December 2006. The ten Australian beach culture themed attractions cost approximately A$56million. These included The Green Room, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The Rip, The BRO, Temple of Huey, Cave of Waves, <b>Wiggle</b> Bay, and Pipeline Plunge. Since then, four additional water slides: two called Little Rippers, one called The Wedgie and one called the Triple Vortex, have been added.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the episode, {{a unique}} type of {{flashback}} is shown: one on the island. In the aftermath of Oceanic Flight 815 crash's, Locke wakes up on the beach, and notices that his toes <b>wiggle,</b> making him realize that he is no longer paralyzed. He stands up and is called over by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to help with an injured person.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and <b>wiggle</b> its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|WhiteWater World opened {{three weeks}} ahead of {{schedule}} on 8 December 2006 {{after a week of}} previews. The park opened with ten attractions, including The Green Room, The Rip, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The BRO, The Temple of Huey (3 individual slides), Pipeline Plunge, <b>Wiggle</b> Bay and the Cave of Waves. At this time, the park featured many Australian and world firsts: The Rip and Super Tubes Hydrocoaster were both Australian firsts; The BRO was a world first; and The Green Room was Australia's biggest Tornado slide. After six months of operation Macquarie Leisure announced that WhiteWater World attracted 247,360 visitors, producing a revenue of $8.7million and a profit of $4million.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, The <b>Wiggles</b> {{included}} {{this song}} on their albums The <b>Wiggles</b> and Pop Go the <b>Wiggles.</b> There are {{two versions of}} this song. One is sung by Greg Page {{and the other is}} sung by Sam Moran.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, Elton {{wrote the}} script for The Wiggles' feature film: Pandamonium!, {{although}} he didn't direct it. He also wrote a Wiggles song for the <b>Wiggle</b> Town DVD and CD: The Wonder of <b>Wiggle</b> Town.|$|E
25|$|Geckos, skinks, {{and other}} lizards that are {{captured}} by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to <b>wiggle,</b> creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The detached tails of leopard geckos can <b>wiggle</b> for up to 20 minutes. In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color {{than the rest of}} the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first. In the shingleback skink and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the head, so that the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} neglect {{may also be}} very mild—for example, in a {{condition}} called extinction where competition from the ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception of the contralesional stimulus. These patients, when asked to fixate on the examiner's nose, can detect fingers being wiggled on the affected side. If the examiner were to <b>wiggle</b> his or her fingers on both the affected and unaffected sides of the patient, the patient will report seeing movement only on the ipsilesional side.|$|E

25|$|Barrie became {{acquainted with}} the family in 1897, meeting George and Jack (and baby Peter) with their nurse (nanny) Mary Hodgson in London's Kensington Gardens. He lived nearby and often walked his Saint Bernard dog Porthos in the park. He entertained the boys {{regularly}} with his ability to <b>wiggle</b> his ears and eyebrows, and with his stories. He did not meet Sylvia until a chance encounter {{at a dinner party}} in December. She told Barrie that Peter had been named after the title character in her father's novel, Peter Ibbetson.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2008, an eel-pass was {{installed}} at Greylake Sluice, consisting of an open-topped metal channel, fitted with bristles on its base, which allows glass eels {{returning from the}} Sargasso Sea to <b>wiggle</b> their way past the sluice. The channel is equipped with an infra-red camera, to allow the movement of eels to be monitored during the night. The installation, together with a similar one at Oath lock on the River Parrett, has provided valuable information on the migration and decline of eels. The Drain is well stocked with fish, and was used, together with the Huntspill River, as the location for the Division 1 National Fishing Championships in 2008.|$|E
25|$|At {{the north}} end, there were {{problems}} {{with the construction of}} Blisworth Tunnel: quicksand was encountered, and errors made in alignment which meant that the tunnel had a pronounced <b>wiggle.</b> With the opening of Braunston Tunnel, the line was open from the Oxford Canal through to Weedon Bec in June 1796. However, Blisworth Tunnel continued to cause problems, collapsing in January 1796. The canal was opened from Braunston to Blisworth in 1797. The canal from the Thames reached Two Waters near Hemel Hempstead in 1798, Bulbourne {{at the north end of}} the Tring summit in 1799, and Stoke Bruerne at the south end of Blisworth Tunnel the following year.|$|E

25|$|In March 1909, Roose {{travelled}} with Wales to play Ireland in a British Home Championship match. He {{appeared at}} Liverpool station {{with one hand}} heavily bandaged, telling the waiting press that he had broken two fingers but would nevertheless play in the match. Roose's Welsh team-mate Billy Meredith, suspecting trickery, peered through the keyhole of the goalkeeper's hotel room soon after their arrival in Belfast and saw his friend remove the bandage and <b>wiggle</b> his fingers {{with no sign of}} discomfort. News of Roose's disability having spread through the city, a huge and expectant crowd turned out next day in the hope of witnessing an Irish victory. Instead Wales won the game 3–2, Roose himself playing superbly.|$|E
25|$|In early 1942, {{prisoners at}} Dachau {{concentration}} camp {{were used by}} Sigmund Rascher in experiments to aid German pilots who had to eject at high altitudes. A low-pressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20,000m (66,000ft). It was rumored that Rascher performed vivisections on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment. Of the 200 subjects, 80 died outright, {{and the others were}} executed. In a letter from April 5, 1942 between Dr. Sigmund Rascher and Heinrich Himmler, Rascher explains the results of a low-pressure experiment that was performed on people at Dachau Concentration camp in which the victims were suffocated while Rascher and another unnamed doctor took note of his reactions. The person was described as 37 years old and in good health before being murdered. Rascher described the victim’s actions as he began to lose oxygen and times the changes in behavior. The 37 year old began to <b>wiggle</b> his head at 4 minutes, a minute later Rascher observed that he was suffering from cramps before falling unconscious. He describes how the victim then laid unconscious breathing only 3 times per minute until he stopped breathing 30 minutes after being deprived of oxygen. The victim then turned blue and began foaming at the mouth. An autopsy followed an hour later.|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) causes damage to nerve roots and fibers that carry {{messages}} {{to and from}} the brain. Spinal cord injuries can result from physical trauma, tumors, developmental disorders or a number of different diseases. In 1995, Christopher Reeve, known for his role in all three Superman movies, was thrown from his horse and landed headfirst into a fence shattering his first and second vertebrae. Reeve’s cervical spinal injury paralyzed him from the neck down. Reeve sought the aid of Dr. John McDonald, who was working at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. After extensive activity-based therapies, Reeve was able to <b>wiggle</b> his toes and move a couple of fingers. Christopher Reeve died in 2004, however his achievements shined light on everyone affected by spinal cord injuries. Dr. McDonald left St. Louis and officially opened the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury (ICSCI) at Kennedy Krieger Institute on June 14, 2005. ICSCI {{is one of the first}} centers to have a focus specifically on children with chronic spinal cord injuries and paralysis. The center utilizes innovative activity-based therapies such as FES cycling, aquatic therapy, and partial weight supported walking to help patients regain sensation and feeling in their bodies. The center combines clinical research with a focus on restoration and rehabilitation for children and adults with chronic paralysis.|$|E

50|$|On 12 December 2006, American-based {{amusement}} park operator Six Flags released plans to partner up with The <b>Wiggles</b> to add <b>Wiggles</b> Worlds {{to some of}} their parks. In 2007, Six Flags Great Adventure, Six Flags Great America, and Six Flags New England all opened a <b>Wiggles</b> World at their park. This was followed by Great Escape in 2008 and Six Flags Fiesta Texas in 2009. In late 2010, Six Flags terminated licenses with various brands including The <b>Wiggles.</b> This saw the areas changed to more generic themes such as KIDZOPOLIS and Safari Kids.|$|R
500|$|Each <b>Wiggle</b> {{developed}} a [...] "schtick" [...] {{based on their}} actual behaviours, which evolved into caricatures, and served the same purpose as the uniforms in differentiating their characters and making them memorable to young children; Field's was eating. Field created and played the original Captain Feathersword; the role {{was taken over by}} Paul Paddick in 1996. Field also played Wags the Dog.|$|E
500|$|Juvenile and subadult {{specimens}} {{generally have}} a more contrasting color pattern, with dark crossbands on a lighter ground color. The ground color is then tan, brown, or reddish brown. The tip of the tail is usually yellowish, becoming greenish yellow or greenish in subadults, and then black in adults. On some juveniles, the banding pattern {{can also be seen}} on the tail. [...] Young snakes <b>wiggle</b> the tips of their tails to lure prey animals.|$|E
500|$|Ed, Edd n Eddy {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Cornelius of DVD Talk considered the Eds to be child equivalents of The Three Stooges, believing that [...] "the series revels {{in the sort}} of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily." [...] Cornelius also wrote that the [...] "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds <b>wiggle</b> and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated." ...|$|E
