5|$|In 561, {{the king}} {{now known as}} Sky <b>Witness</b> {{installed}} a ruler {{at the site of}} Los Alacranes. Sky <b>Witness</b> played a major part in the political events of the Maya region. He became the overlord of the city of Caracol, to the south of Naranjo, which had previously been a vassal of Tikal. In 562, according to a damaged text at Caracol, Sky <b>Witness</b> defeated Tikal itself and sacrificed its king Wak Chan K'awiil, thus ending his branch of the royal dynasty at Tikal. This catastrophic defeat began a 130-year hiatus for Tikal, reflecting an extended period of dominance by Calakmul. This event is used as a marker to divide the Early Classic from the Late Classic. Sky <b>Witness</b> is also mentioned at Okop, a site much further north in Quintana Roo. The last reference to Sky <b>Witness</b> occurs at Caracol and is dated to AD 572. The text is damaged but probably records the death of this powerful king.|$|E

5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} a <b>witness</b> to Puiset's charters, {{and was named}} as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194, probably from about 1189. He was a frequent <b>witness</b> to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III.

Emma, who had retired to Winchester after regaining Edward's favour, may also have influenced the appointment, either alone or in concert with Godwin.

40|$|<b>Witnessing</b> {{domestic}} violence during childhood {{has been associated}} with various negative health outcomes. In this work, we conducted a series of analyses to further explore the effects of <b>witnessing</b> that persist into adolescence, adulthood, and, taking a novel approach, to the next generation of children. ^ First, we compared <b>witnessing</b> status and subsequent experiences with different types (physical, sexual, emotional, or multiple types) of adolescent relationship violence by comparing standardized marginal effects from multiply-imputed data. <b>Witnessing</b> was associated with all forms of violence, and additive effect modification indicated that female <b>witnesses</b> were more likely than male <b>witnesses</b> to experience victimization-related outcomes. In contrast, male <b>witnesses</b> were more likely than female <b>witnesses</b> to experience perpetration-related outcomes, except for physical perpetration. ^ Second, using standardized multinomial regression, we compared whether <b>witnessing</b> same-gender, opposite-gender, or bidirectional {{domestic violence}} perpetration was associated with different adolescent relationship violence outcomes for boys and girls. Compared to non-witnesses, boys who <b>witnessed</b> adult males perpetrate had increased adolescent perpetration. In contrast, girls had increased adolescent victimization if they <b>witnessed</b> males and females perpetrating together and had a tendency toward higher victimization when <b>witnessing</b> males perpetrate alone. Notably, boys and girls who <b>witnessed</b> females perpetrate, alone or together with a male, had increased risk for combined victimization/perpetration compared to non-witnesses. ^ Finally, perhaps the greatest challenge in this field is having to rely on observational studies, particularly because <b>witnessing</b> co-occurs with many confounding experiences. To overcome this limitation, we used propensity score weighting and applied a new approach to understand the impact that intergenerational violence has on health. Comparing the effects of <b>witnessing</b> domestic violence on first- and second-generation health outcomes using parent-child pairs from a population-based study, we found no effect of <b>witnessing</b> on general health of adults who <b>witnessed</b> violence during childhood. However, children whose parents <b>witnessed</b> domestic violence had worse health compared to children with non-witnessing parents. ^ This work further supports the theory of intergenerational violence transmission and provides a springboard for future studies by offering a novel approach to studying multi-generational effects of <b>witnessing</b> and promoting more rigorous methods to remove the effects of commonly confounding exposures. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examined}} United Kingdom police officers' perceptions about older <b>witnesses</b> (> 60 years) and their thoughts about employing the cognitive interview (CI) with this group. Method. A questionnaire {{was used to}} assess officers' opinions about current interviewing protocols for older <b>witnesses,</b> including the CI, and to explore the challenges involved with interviewing older <b>witnesses.</b> Results. Over half of the officers surveyed perceived older <b>witnesses</b> to be less reliable and less thorough than younger <b>witnesses.</b> Many officers lacked confidence in dealing with the emotional distress and memory loss often displayed by older <b>witnesses</b> and victims. Several officers stated they were inadequately trained and had insufficient time to devote to interviewing in general. Moreover, the number of officers who considered the CI to be helpful with older <b>witnesses</b> was roughly equivalent to the number of officers who believed it was not. Conclusions: These results suggest that police officers, like mock jurors, consider older adult <b>witnesses</b> and victims to be less reliable and thorough than younger adult <b>witnesses.</b> Furthermore, the results indicate that many officers are not always satisfied with their interviews of older <b>witnesses</b> and victims. Implications for officer training are discussed. ...|$|R
