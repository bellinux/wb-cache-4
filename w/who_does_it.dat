5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Work teams (also {{referred}} to as production and service teams) are continuing work units responsible for producing goods or providing services for the organization. Their membership is typically stable, usually full-time, and well-defined. These teams are traditionally directed by a supervisor who mandates what work is done, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it,</b> and in what manner is it executed. Work teams are effectively used in manufacturing sectors such as mining and apparel and service based sectors such as accounting which utilize audit teams.|$|E

500|$|A {{highlight}} {{derived from}} Ephron's book {{and that was}} consistently praised was the O'Donnell portrayal {{of the role of}} the purse in the scene [...] "I Hate My Purse!". While Reiner says, [...] "There's an amusing 'I hate my purse' segment", Isherwood notes [...] "The smartest and shapeliest piece of writing in the show is that acerbic essay by Nora Ephron about her troublesome relationship with purses...Entrusted to Ms. O'Donnell, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> proud, the essay is a defiant denunciation of the tyranny of the pocketbook, a 'j'accuse' for the era of the 'it' bag." [...] Shaw described O'Donnell's purse performance as an aria, and Jerry Tallmer of The Villager called it [...] "one of the pillars of the show". This scene is sometimes performed alone outside of the theatre.|$|E
500|$|Yet {{another option}} is to create the UNPA as a nongovernmental {{organization}} of democratically elected legislators. This would have the advantage of not requiring the cooperation of (sometimes dictatorial) national governments or world parliamentary organizations with dictatorial members, so only democratic legislators, parliaments and countries would be represented. The World Constitution and Parliament Association and other NGOs have attempted to set up workable parliaments. Dieter Heinrich critiqued this approach by saying, [...] "If it did succeed on any scale, it would divert resources from pressuring governments on thousands of specific issues, which citizens are good at, into the operation of a pan-global institutional structure, which citizens' groups are ill equipped to do...And the resulting assembly would always be of doubtful legitimacy (<b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> really represent?) and of unlikely value as an evolutionary starting point for a real world parliament." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Commander" [...] is an electro-house-R song, set in {{a common}} time {{signature}} of 125beats per minute. It was written by Kelly Rowland, Rico Love, David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as [...] "there's no other who do it like I do it" [...] and [...] "you won't find no lady <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> like I does it". The lyrics have themes around hair, fashion and competing with other women. Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats, {{which is similar to}} his other production, [...] "Sexy Bitch". The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip-hop producer Timbaland. Rowland explained that the hook of the song, [...] "Commander", should be associated with dance instead of the military. [...] "When I command you to dance ... I want you moving, you know? It felt good to have a song that I could express that in." ...|$|E
500|$|Chappuis drew {{considerable}} {{attention in the}} national press for his abilities as a passer, one of the game's first passing [...] "specialists." [...] In November 1947, Time magazine ran a feature article about Chappuis and the 1947 Wolverines (with Chappuis' photograph on the cover) called [...] "The Specialist." [...] The Time article focused on the new era of specialization marked by coach Fritz Crisler's decision to field separate offensive and defensive units in 1947. The article focused on Chappuis as Michigan's [...] "prize specialist," [...] who was described as [...] "Crisler's triggerman." [...] "His job is to throw forward passes {{and there is no}} one in 1947 collegiate football <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> better. … In Michigan's first five games, Specialist Chappuis was on the field less than one-third of the time, but of the 27passes he threw, 19 were complete – five of them for touchdowns... When Chappuis fades back to pass, he is a slow-motion study in coolness and concentration." ...|$|E
500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

Well the problem is that <b>it</b> isn't about <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> It's a mystery about a relationship, two people, and how finding that out affects their relationship...

2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> all belong to and why is it all going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E
2500|$|Staughton Lynd, {{chairman}} of the 1965 [...] "March on Washington", was asked by Russell {{to participate in the}} tribunal and rejected the invitation. Lynd's objections and criticism of the Tribunal were {{based on the fact that}} Russell planned to investigate only non-North Vietnamese and National Liberation Front conduct, sheltering Hanoi from any criticism for their behaviour. Lynd wrote that [...] "in conversation with the emissary who proffered the invitation, I urged that the alleged war crimes of any party to the conflict should come before the Tribunal. After all, I argued, a [...] "crime" [...] is an action that is wrong no matter <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> Pressing my case, I asked, [...] "What if it were shown that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam tortures unarmed prisoners?" [...] The answer, as I understood it, was, [...] "Anything is justified that drives the imperialist aggressor into the sea." [...] I declined the invitation to be a member of the Tribunal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Surah 27:54-58 {{refers to}} the {{punishment}} that befell the people of Lut: [...] "And (remember) Lut when {{he said to his}} people, 'Do you commit al-Fahishah (evil, great sin, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, sodomy) while you see (one another doing evil without any screen) Do you practice your lusts on men instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly.' There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: 'Drive out the family of Loot from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!' So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind. And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned." [...] Muhammad has also thus said: [...] "Whoever of you finds (someone) doing the deed of the people of Lot, kill the one <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> and the one to whom it is done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uri Misgav, {{writing for}} Haaretz, {{claims that the}} Iron Dome {{developers}} have created a technological marvel and saved many lives, but at the strategic level the invention also causes damage by [...] "allowing Israelis to inflate their sense of victimhood". In his view, the Iron Dome allows the various Israeli governments to undertake a [...] "limited (military) operation" [...] and therefore shift discussion away from other topics such as the economic recession and corruption concerns. According to Misgav, the Iron Dome does not only shoot down missiles, it also [...] "shoots {{down some of the}} capacity of Israelis for free thought, [...] it reduces their motivation to ask themselves how and why the present 'round of escalation' has started, who escalated it? <b>Who</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> serve? And why is it that suddenly rockets are falling from the sky?" [...] Misgav further writes that the Iron Dome will not return peace to the residents of southern Israel nor the residents of the Gaza Strip who he claims live [...] "under siege".|$|E
