5|$|Google has {{questioned}} the proposal, saying the prohibitions {{would be too}} broad. It is strongly opposed by free speech groups. A poll conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research for the Hungry Beast television program found that 80% of their 1,000 respondents were in favour {{of the concept of}} the plan.

5|$|That {{following}} offseason, Kelly, Sam Bohne {{and other}} Major League Baseball (MLB) players agreed to play professional basketball with O'Connell. National League (NL) president John Heydler insisted {{that anyone who}} played with O'Connell could be suspended. The Giants were also displeased with Kelly's arrangement, as they <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> chance he could injure himself in non-baseball activity. However, Kelly had not played in any games at that point. He {{was removed from the}} roster and thus avoided suspension by MLB.|$|E

5|$|About 200 free {{wireless}} access points {{were set up}} around the city to aid with the city's goal of increasing access to the internet. US Internet paid $500,000 up front and agreed to pay five percent of its yearly revenues for seven years to maintain them, totaling about $10 million. By 2010, 44 such points {{had been set up}} at community centers around Minneapolis, {{out of a total of}} 117 which had also gone up in parks and on street corners around the city.

5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the pig bristles from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E
5|$|As the {{paperback}} book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote {{that she was}} told to make the relationship end badly in Spring Fire because the publishers <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, friends <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Marquess's {{addiction}} to drugs, particularly since multiple prison sentences {{had done nothing}} to alleviate it. He was deported from Australia in April 1990 and charged with drug possession in November 1991 and March 1992. That October, his estate company was liquidated with debts over £650,000. In June 1993, he avoided a jail sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead {{and was sentenced to}} 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five. He was arrested again in September 1994 for possession.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun {{died at the}} Old Brick Capitol {{boarding}} house in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1850, of tuberculosis, {{at the age of}} 68. He was interred at the St. Philip's Churchyard in Charleston, South Carolina. During the Civil War, a group of Calhoun's friends <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possible desecration of his grave by Federal troops and, during the night, removed his coffin to a hiding place under the stairs of the church. The next night, his coffin was buried in an unmarked grave near the church, where it remained until 1871, when it was again exhumed and returned to its original place.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{temporarily}} {{returned to}} England to shoot scenes at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, which stood {{in for a}} location in Rome, {{before moving on to}} the city itself for a five-week shoot across the city, with locations including the Ponte Sisto bridge and the Roman Forum. The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E

5|$|Screenwriter Andrew Davies {{said he was}} {{attracted}} to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica; he compared it to Pride and Prejudice—for which he wrote the BBC screenplay—"with dirty bits". Both Waters and Davies <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of dildos in scenes with Diana, but the BBC allowed it. When news releases told of the BBC featuring swearing and sex toys, the Daily Mail reported that viewers began to protest. BBC representatives downplayed the gratuitousness of the story, comparing it to Moll Flanders.|$|E
5|$|The British Government and Royal Navy <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> threat Tirpitz posed {{once she}} re-entered service. Allied {{intelligence}} tracked {{the progress of}} work on the battleship using decrypted German radio signals, photo reconnaissance flights and eyewitness reports from agents in Norway. It was feared the battleship could sortie and attack convoys in the Norwegian Sea or Atlantic Ocean after the repairs were completed. The need to guard against this possibility would also occupy warships needed to support the planned invasion of France. As a result, it was decided in late 1943 to make further attempts to sink the battleship.|$|E
5|$|When the Welsh {{family moved}} to Los Angeles, the Earps {{accepted}} an invitation to stay {{with them for a}} while in their top-floor apartment until the Earps found a place to rent. After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, she still did not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.|$|E

5|$|Both Democrats and Republicans <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of S. Brewer Erwin, nominee {{of the newly}} formed Populist Party, in the race; he enjoyed strong support for a third-party candidate, {{despite the fact that}} many believed his party's platform was too radical. Democrats, who were used to carrying the agrarian vote by a wide margin, were especially concerned that the Farmers' Alliance, consisting of over 125,000 members in Kentucky, would endorse Erwin. This did not occur, however, and in the general election, Brown defeated Wood by a vote of 144,168 to 116,087. Though he won the election, Brown had not won a majority of the votes; Populist Erwin captured 25,631 votes – 9 percent of the total cast – and a Prohibition candidate received 3,292 votes.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly {{began with the}} issue of ordination, as many of the divines <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 popular uprisings {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots, and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by General Joan Prim), who <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. However, the intellectuals behind the Republic were powerless to prevent a descent into chaos. Uprisings were crushed by the military. The old monarchy returned with {{the restoration of the}} Bourbons in December 1874, as reform was deemed less important than peace and stability. Despite the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1890, elections were controlled by local political bosses (caciques).|$|E
