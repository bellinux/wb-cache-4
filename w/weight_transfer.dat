5|$|The {{load borne}} by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass {{location}}, which in turn varies with the amount and location of passengers and luggage, but also with acceleration and deceleration. This phenomenon is known as load transfer or <b>weight</b> <b>transfer,</b> depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers. For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the British Grand Prix, the FIA announced a total {{ban on the}} Front-and-Rear Interconnected suspension system (commonly abbreviated as FRIC) starting with immediate effect {{on the grounds that}} it was a movable aerodynamic device under Article 3.15 of the technical regulations. The FRIC system linked the front and rear suspension arrays together, using inertia to transfer hydraulic fluid across the car to offset the effects of <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> on the car under braking, acceleration and cornering, thereby creating a static ride height and improving stability.|$|E
25|$|The Rs were {{pressed into}} {{secondary}} passenger and goods service, roles {{for which a}} Hudson with large diameter driving wheels was sometimes a less than ideal choice. There was little opportunity to exploit their high speed capability. Furthermore, their relatively low factor of adhesion (4.08) and lack of fully compensated springing, coupled with the tendency of locomotives to transfer weight to the rearmost wheels under high drawbar pull conditions (which {{in the case of}} the R meant a <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> from the driving wheels to the unpowered trailing truck) caused them to slip when starting heavy goods trains.|$|E

25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E
500|$|Like the E-series HSV GTS, the {{suspension}} is fitted with switchable Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide") offering Luxury or Performance modes. It does this by electrically adjusting the viscosity of the ferrofluid inside the shock absorbers, producing different damping levels. Magnetic Ride Control also enhances braking by preventing forward <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> {{when the car}} is under heavy braking. The MRC system development took three years and cost HSV more than $4.5 million.|$|E

2500|$|Weight is also {{transferred}} from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight.

2500|$|Unlike car {{disc brakes}} that are buried within the wheel, bike disc brakes {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior braking performance, such discs rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|E
2500|$|For decades, Marines {{learned a}} variety of martial arts and other methods of hand-to-hand combat, but these were {{irregular}} processes that varied greatly from unit to unit {{and from time to}} time. Eventually, the Corps solidified its various teachings into the LINE combat system, but its inherent inflexibility was evident. In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated a new program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Due to an expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals. It is also a stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the [...] "Warrior Ethos" [...] within Marines. The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts melded together and consists of boxing movements, joint locking techniques, opponent <b>weight</b> <b>transfer</b> (Jujitsu), ground grappling (mostly wrestling), bayonet, knife and baton fighting, non-compliance joint manipulations, and blood restriction chokes.
