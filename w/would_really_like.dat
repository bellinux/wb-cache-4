Ironically, the award show {{was sponsored by}} Pepsi that year, and when Madonna came onstage to receive the award she added, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> to thank Pepsi for causing so much controversy." [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] also topped video countdowns and critic lists. It was number one on MTV's countdown of [...] "100 Videos That Broke The Rules" [...] in 2005, and for the 25th anniversary of MTV, viewers voted it as the [...] "Most Groundbreaking Music Video of All Time". In addition, the clip was ranked at number20 on Rolling Stones [...] "The 100 Top Music Videos" [...] and at number two on VH1's 100 Greatest Videos. Fuse TV named [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] one of its 10 [...] "Videos That Rocked The World".

2500|$|In April 2006 {{and again}} in December 2007, Binoche {{travelled}} to Tehran {{at the invitation of}} Abbas Kiarostami. While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film Shirin (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche's visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to [...] "cultural destruction". In June 2009 Binoche began work on Certified Copy directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European [...] "best actress triple crown": Best Actress at Venice for Three Colors: Blue, Best Actress at Berlin for The English Patient and Best Actress at Cannes for Certified Copy. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine Profil, [...] "Please can you explain to me what the mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?" [...] he said. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing". In response, while promoting Certified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazine Empire saying, [...] "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence ... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem." [...] Certified Copy proved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, [...] "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire {{there will not be a}} general screening." ...|$|E

5000|$|Robin Wood {{graduated}} from Michigan State University in 1976 {{with a degree}} in Special Education for the Visually Impaired. Her interest in fantasy and science fiction art stemmed from a visit to Detroit Triple Fanfair in 1972. After being a [...] "convention artist" [...] for a number of years, she got her first professional commission in 1983 from Mayfair Games to design the character cards for their Dragonriders of Pern board game. In 1984, Robin Wood met Anne McCaffrey at a convention and in the following years, artist and author frequently exchanged their ideas about what the Pern characters <b>would</b> <b>really</b> look <b>like</b> which subsequently {{led to the development of}} the book People of Pern published in 1988.|$|R
5000|$|... "My List" [...] is a {{song about}} a man who has a list of things to do each day.

50|$|Snow White or Snow is a shy {{girl whose}} {{stepmother}} {{does not seem}} to like her. She is described as a girl with pale skin and short ebony hair. When Snow was less than a year old, her mother died and her father married her stepmother, Ms. Wicked. Then, when Snow was six, her father died, leaving Snow with her mean stepmom. They were booted out of the castle by a distant heir and Ms. Wicked got a teaching job at Grimm Academy to get by. The third book is written from Snow's point of view. Snow is allergic to all kinds of fruit and she believes in lucky charms. She wears a clover charm around her neck at all times. Like her mother, Snow is good at sewing and <b>would</b> have <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> to have learned from her mother. Snow has a crush on Prince Prince. Her lucky charm is a silver tiara that can make her invisible.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if you were the one being wooed. I wanted to like it more than I did. Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs <b>would</b> have <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|R
60|$|Pierston reflected. His {{presence}} in London had been desired for some time; {{yet he had}} delayed going because of his new solicitudes here. But to go and take her with him would afford him opportunity of watching over her, tending her mind, and developing it; while it might remove her from some looming danger. It was a somewhat awkward guardianship for him, as a lonely man, to carry out; still, it could be done. He asked her abruptly if she <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> to go away for a while.|$|E
60|$|Ellen thanked vehemently, and Alfred gave feeble thanks; but, unluckily, {{he had so}} set {{his mind}} upon raspberries, {{that he could not}} enjoy the thought of {{anything}} else. It was a sickly distaste for everything, and Miss Selby saw that he was not as much pleased as she meant him to be; she looked at him wistfully, and, half grieved, half impatient, she longed to know what he <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> or if he were positively ungrateful. She was very young, and did not know whether it was by his fault or her mistake that she had failed to satisfy him.|$|E
60|$|Ellen West was {{ten years}} older than Rosemary, and so {{different}} from her that {{it was hard to believe}} they were sisters. She was dark and massive, with black hair, thick, black eyebrows and eyes of the clear, slaty blue of the gulf water in a north wind. She had a rather stern, forbidding look, but she was in reality very jolly, with a hearty, gurgling laugh and a deep, mellow, pleasant voice with a suggestion of masculinity about it. She had once remarked to Rosemary that she <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> to have a talk with that Presbyterian minister at the Glen, to see if he could find a word to say to a woman when he was cornered. She had her chance now and she tackled him on world politics. Miss Ellen, who was a great reader, had been devouring a book on the Kaiser of Germany, and she demanded Mr. Meredith's opinion of him.|$|E
60|$|Once more I had {{an author}} for whom I {{could feel a}} {{personal}} devotion, whom I could dream of and dote upon, and whom I could offer my intimacy in many an impassioned revery. I do not think T. B. Macaulay <b>would</b> <b>really</b> have <b>liked</b> it; I dare say {{he would not have}} valued the friendship of the sort of a youth I was, but in the conditions he was helpless, and I poured out my love upon him without a rebuff. Of course I reformed my prose style, which had been carefully modelled upon that of Goldsmith and Irving, and began to write in the manner of Macaulay, in short, quick sentences, and with the prevalent use of brief Anglo-Saxon words, which he prescribed, but did not practise. As for his notions of literature, I simply accepted them with the feeling that any question of them would have been little better than blasphemy.|$|R
5000|$|The goal in {{relative}} colorimetry {{is to be}} truthful to the specified color, with only a correction for the media. Relative colorimetry is useful in proofing applications, since you are using it {{to get an idea}} of how a print on one device will appear on a different device. Media differences are the only thing you <b>really</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to adjust for. Obviously there has to be some gamut mapping going on also. Usually this is done in a way where hue and lightness are maintained at the cost of reduced saturation.|$|R
60|$|The {{odd thing}} was that this odd fish seemed {{from the very first}} to imagine she had {{accepted}} him as a follower. And he was quite prepared to follow.

If only she could have got into the right state of mind, she <b>would</b> <b>really</b> rather have <b>liked</b> him. He smiled at her, and said really interesting things between his big teeth. There was something rather nice about him. But, we must repeat, {{it was as if the}} glass wall of an aquarium divided them.|$|R
