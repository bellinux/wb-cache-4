5|$|In the 970s, Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade, {{became the}} most {{powerful}} man in Norway, at first supported by Harald Bluetooth of Denmark and paying tribute to him—though the two later fell out over religious matters. Harald had converted to Christianity and <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to Christianise Norway, while Haakon remained a staunch pagan. In 995 Haakon was deposed and the young Christian leader Olaf Tryggvason came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> {{to control}} the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To this end it emphasised various social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT's permission. Under Kenyatta, Kenya's first university—the University of Nairobi—was established, with several others following after.|$|E

He had suffered a heart attack, and despite being rushed to hospital in Putney he died soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} San Luis Potosí, Blancornelas {{began his career}} as a {{journalist}} for El Sol de San Luis in April 1955, working as a sportswriter. In 1960, he moved to Tijuana, Baja California, where he became active in reporting on corruption and the drug trade. He was promoted to news editor at the daily newspaper El Mexicano before moving to the daily La Voz de la Frontera, of which he became editor-in-chief. Unlike several other journalists during his time, Blancornelas <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to write about drug trafficking and corruption, leading to his firing from three newspapers before deciding to create his own.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Monroe and Fox {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP {{would not be able to}} finance films alone, and the studio <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{concluded}} the trial period at Blackburn {{by agreeing to}} a three-month pay-as-you-play deal. He stated that he <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> {{to return to the}} Premier League and that his pre-existing relationship with Ince would not earn him any preferential treatment. He made his first appearance against Everton in a 1–0 win in the League Cup on 24 September. With a month left on his contract at Blackburn, Fowler received interest from League Two side Grimsby Town. Fowler, a noted friend of then Grimsby manager Mike Newell had held talks at Blundell Park over a possible Player/Coach role with the club.|$|E
5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out}} on the Plain of Jars as the members of each political grouping chose sides. Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E
5|$|In 1335 Orleton {{collated}} Edington to {{the rectory}} of Cheriton, Hampshire, and from 1335 to 1346 he was {{master of the}} Hospital of St Cross in Winchester. Also the King <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to reward his capable servant; in 1341 {{he was given the}} prebend of Leighton Manor (Lincoln), by 1344 he also held that of Netheravon (Salisbury), and by 1345 that of Putston (Hereford). This level of pluralism was not unusual at the time. His greatest preferment, however, came with his papal appointment– on the King's request– to the see of Winchester in 1345. This was the richest see in England, considered second only to the archbishopric of Milan.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Hepburn {{returned}} to Broadway {{to appear in}} another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper of the Flame (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message {{on the dangers of}} fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement. It received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy–Hepburn pairing.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} months, Johnson flew as a night fighter pilot. Using day fighters {{to act as}} night fighters without radar was largely {{unsuccessful}} in intercepting German bombers during The Blitz; Johnson's only action occurred on 22 February 1941 when he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Spitfire R6611, QJ-F. A week later, Johnson's squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast. Johnson <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to see combat after just 10.40 operational hours and welcomed the prospect of meeting the enemy from Tangmere. If the Germans did not resume their assault the Wing {{was to take the}} fight to them.|$|E
5|$|Lombard <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> {{to win an}} Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kim Deal <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to {{continue}} recording and performing. At first, she envisioned her next album {{as a solo}} record, on which she would play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal {{decided not to go}} solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal began calling herself Tammy Ampersand, and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This later became simply the Amps.|$|E
