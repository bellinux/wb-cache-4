On the Campbell brothers Mount Cole run, settled in 1840, the Beeripmo balug and Utoul balug clans were allowed to stay on the run and were actively supplied with food and clothing establishing a relationship of care and protection.

The BR maintained a helper station at a siding between Dellwood and Lanes Mills, south of Brockwayville. The 700 series Mallets stationed here were required to assist coal trains up to McMinn Summit. When this was necessary, the dispatcher would call the crew to work by ringing a phone booth located next to the siding. A loud bell generally sufficed to wake up the engine crew. On those occasions when it did not, the dispatcher would call the McMinn farm nearby, {{and one of the}} McMinn children would run over to the siding to awaken the engineer and fireman.|$|E

By the time they were further down the hill, they would have been out of the infrasound's path and would have regained their composure, but in the darkness would be unable to return to their shelter.

25|$|Three game modes are {{included}} with the game, with two more available via downloadable content. The first game mode, Power Race, is a hybrid of both racing and combat. Players can collect powerups to give their planes different abilities. These abilities include such things as missiles, machine guns, mines, or an EMP blast. The goal is to use <b>whatever</b> <b>means</b> necessary to achieve the highest finishing rank {{at the end of}} a given race. The second mode is focused solely on racing. Entitled Speed Race, this mode omits all weapons and powerups. In their place are rings scattered throughout the course. Flying through these rings provides the plane with an extra burst of speed, and flying through multiple in succession will multiply that speed. As with Power Race the goal is to finish the race in as high a rank as possible.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of November 19, 1837, Coacoochee and {{nineteen}} other Seminoles, including two women, escaped from Fort Marion. Coacoochee, known for fabricating entertaining stories, later told the tale that only he and his friend Talmus Hadjo had escaped by squeezing through the eight-inch (203mm) opening of the embrasure located high in their cell and sliding down a makeshift rope into the dry moat. Talmus Hadjo, however, {{was not on the}} official list of prisoners. By <b>whatever</b> <b>means</b> the escape was actually effected, the escapees made their way to their band's encampment at the headwaters of the Tomoka River, about forty miles south of St. Augustine. Because of their ill treatment, they vowed to continue fighting, and the war was prolonged for four more years. The cell from which Coacoochee escaped was long part of the official lore of the fort.|$|E

Fekner's stencil Wheels Over Indian Trails greeted motorists and international travelers arriving in New York City at the Pulaski Bridge Queens Midtown Tunnel from 1979 to 1990. The message remained untouched for eleven years, until Earth Day 1990, when Mr. Fekner, feeling the piece had run its course, painted over it.|$|E
25|$|As on-air WCW President, Flair began abusing {{his power}} much like Bischoff had, favoring villains over fan {{favorites}} and even awarding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship (which was vacated by Scott Steiner due to injury) {{to his son}} David and resorting to <b>whatever</b> <b>means</b> necessary to keep him as United States Heavyweight Champion. Flair eventually formed a stable of followers which included Roddy Piper, Arn Anderson and the Jersey Triad to keep things in order. Flair's reign as president {{came to an end}} on the July 19 episode of Nitro, when he faced and lost to Sting for the position. During the course of the match, Sting had Flair in his Scorpion Death Lock, but with the referee knocked unconscious, no decision could be reached. A returning Eric Bischoff came to the ring and began ordering the timekeeper to ring the bell, which he eventually did, awarding the match and the presidency to Sting (who promptly gave it up upon receiving it).|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a ritual that provides one {{with the ability to}} turn into a wolf. Such a transformation may be related either to lycanthropy itself, a widespread phenomenon, but attested especially in the Balkans-Carpathian region, or a ritual imitation of the behavior and appearance of the wolf. Such a ritual was presumably a military initiation, potentially reserved to a secret brotherhood of warriors (or Männerbünde). To become formidable warriors they would assimilate behavior of the wolf, wearing wolf skins during the ritual. Traces related to wolves as a cult or as totems were found in this area since the Neolithic period, including the Vinča culture artifacts: wolf statues and fairly rudimentary figurines representing dancers with a wolf mask. The items could indicate warrior initiation rites, or ceremonies in which young people put on their seasonal wolf masks. The element of unity of beliefs about werewolves and lycanthropy exists in the magical-religious experience of mystical solidarity with the wolf by <b>whatever</b> <b>means</b> used to obtain it. But all have one original myth, a primary event.|$|E

25|$|The Númenóreans became great seafarers, {{and were}} learned and wise beyond all other men; {{and they were}} granted a {{lifespan}} three times that of other mortal men; and at first, they held to the Ban of the Valar, never sailing into the Undying Lands. And so they travelled east, and coming to Middle-earth they helped teach the lesser men valuable skills. After a time, they became jealous of the Elves for their immortality. Meanwhile, in Middle-earth {{it became apparent that}} Sauron, Morgoth's chief servant, was still active. He worked with Elven smiths, especially Celebrimbor, the grandson of Fëanor in Eregion on the craft of rings, and secretly forged the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom to dominate them all. But as soon as Sauron put on the One Ring, The Elves were aware of him and removed theirs. Sauron then made war on the elves, and nearly destroyed them utterly; but when it seemed defeat was imminent, the Númenóreans, led by Tar-Minastir, joined the battle and completely crushed the forces of Sauron, thus saving Gil-galad and the elves of Middle-earth from obliteration.

25|$|She {{was from}} the outset {{considered}} to have great promise, but it was nevertheless {{difficult for her to}} win the leading roles from more established actors such as Zelma Hedin, Charlotta Almlöf, and Fanny Westerdahl, the stars of the 1850s. She had a brief affair with the Crown Prince, the future Charles XV of Sweden, who advised her to marry Daniel Hwasser, the secretary of the royal theatres direction, which oversaw the royal theatre. She took the Crown Prince's advice and married Hwasser in 1858, after which he was made director of the theatre. The fact that Elise Hwasser was suddenly awarded leading roles did not go unnoticed in the press: during her husband's short period as director of the theatre, she played all the leading female parts. Although this may very well have been the result of nepotism, it is equally clear that she did have talent as an actress – a talent that she was now able to demonstrate. Proof of this is provided by the fact that, after her husband had been dismissed as a director and her royal lover had acquired a new mistress, she nevertheless continued to play the leading female parts. <b>Whatever</b> <b>means</b> she had employed, she had now proven herself and, for the next thirty years, she played the leading female role in well over one hundred and fifty performances.|$|E

500|$|Bowen has {{described}} Tippett as [...] "a composer of our time", one who [...] engaged with the social, {{political and cultural}} issues of his day. [...] Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of [...] "ultimately optimistic humanism". [...] Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works [...] to seek [...] "to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, {{while at the same}} time never losing sight of the contemporary reality". The key early work in this respect is A Child of Our Time, of which Clarke writes: [...] "he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know my shadow and my light, So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett... this [...] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works". Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett's craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the [...] task that he had set himself of [...] "transmut his personal and private agonies into... something universal and impersonal". Michael Kennedy has referred to Tippett's [...] "open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world", while accepting the technical sophistication of his music.
