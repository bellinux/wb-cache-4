25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E
500|$|On August 1, 1895, {{the first}} part of The Woman's Bible was published, {{covering}} the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The text went through seven printings in six months; it was a best-seller. In January 1898, the second part was published, covering the rest of the Old Testament as well as all of the New Testament. It included a Preface written by Stanton in which she acknowledged that [...] "Both friend and foe object to the title." [...] Nevertheless, she praised the Revising Committee for showing [...] "a more worshipful reverence for the great Spirit of All Good than does the Church." [...] Stanton wrote: [...] "We have made a fetich [...] of the Bible long enough. The time has come to read it as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> other books, accepting the good and rejecting the evil it teaches." ...|$|E
500|$|On 12 June 2012, Spearritt {{denied the}} reunion plans {{and stated that}} she will not return to S Club or {{continue}} her music career and will keep on pursuing her acting career. She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in my plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working {{and being able to}} do what I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as I can keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago and we talked about it and we still are talking about it. We are all in the same head space, talking about how special it was and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, poor James!" [...] she said. [...] "God knows <b>we</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> could, as poor as we are--we wouldn't see {{him want}} {{anything}} {{while he was}} in it." ...|$|R

500|$|Despite this assessment, {{the end of}} the show's {{fourth season}} saw Hahn grow closer to {{orthopedic}} surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. [...] We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Power Hungry" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Jason Cahill and playwright Julia Cho, each of which {{would go on to}} write other first season episodes. Christopher Misiano directed the installment. According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to [...] "justify it scientifically." [...] For [...] "Power Hungry", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, [...] "And through kneading that idea over and over again, we {{came up with the idea}} of a character, Joseph, who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices." [...] New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. [...] "It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads," [...] he said. [...] "And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'"? ...|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E

2500|$|March 24, 2004: In {{testimony}} to the 9/11 Commission, Clarke indicated that the request was not abnormal, [...] "The Saudi embassy, therefore, asked for these people to be evacuated; {{the same sort of}} thing that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the time in similar crises, evacuating Americans. The request came to me and I refused to approve it." [...] He goes on to explain that the FBI eventually approved the flights and he describes conversations in which the FBI has said that there was no one who left on those flights who the FBI now wants to interview.|$|E
2500|$|On April 24, Christie denied {{creating}} a [...] "culture of divisiveness" [...] or that perceptions about his attitude {{may have led}} others to plan and allow the lane closures to occur as retaliation. [...] "If in fact I created a culture where people were going after each other, then how did <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> these things together with Republicans and Democrats?" [...] Christie asked during a Brick, New Jersey town hall meeting. [...] The Star-Ledger editorial board answered that Richard Nixon had cut deals with Democrats, but had still abused power; and that despite Christie's early bipartisanship, he has thrown himself into several partisan standoffs; and that his personal style had always been [...] "vindictive and aggressive"; and concluded that Christie [...] "created the culture that inspired" [...] the lane closures.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aim of the}} {{organisation}} was to coordinate the activities of anti-communist movements in the Socialist bloc and in the Third World and challenge the legitimacy of Communist governments everywhere.

6000|$|What {{the world}} at large really needs, and will one day get, is not this, but due {{recognition}} of the true value of science in education. We don't all want to be made into first-class anatomists like Owen, still less into first-class practical surgeons, like Sir Henry Thompson. But what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> want is a competent general knowledge (amongst other things) of anatomy at large, and especially of human anatomy; of physiology at large, and especially of human physiology. We don't all want to be analytical chemists: but what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> want is to know as much about oxygen and carbon as will enable us to understand the commonest phenomena of combustion, of chemical combination, of animal or vegetable life. We don't all want to be zoologists, and botanists of the type who put their names after [...] "critical species:" [...] but what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> want to know is as much about plants and animals as will enable us to walk through life intelligently, and to understand the meaning of the things that surround us. We want, in one word, a general acquaintance with the results rather than with the methods of science.|$|E
60|$|But here I {{met with}} firmer opposition. No threats of mine could induce {{them to give}} up the Countess. We {{tightened}} the cord.
