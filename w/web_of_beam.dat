To investigate the strength and the behavior of the block shear <b>of</b> coped <b>beams</b> with welded end connections, ten full-scale coped beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the aspect ratio of the clip angles, the web shear and tension area around the clip angles, the web thickness, beam section depth, cope length, and connection position. The test results indicated that the specimens failed, developing either tension fractures <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> {{near the bottom of the}} clip angles or local web buckling near the end of the cope. Although the final failure mode of the six specimens was local web buckling, it was observed during the tests that these specimens exhibited a significant deformation of the block shear type prior to reaching their final failure mode.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the degree of influence of holes in the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>beams</b> with long spanson weakening of their bearing capacity. Making holes in the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beam</b> generally reduces the bearing capacity <b>of</b> the <b>beam.</b> However, it might be necessary seen from both an architectural perspective {{as well as from}} a building services perspective by creating an opportunity for building installations. The objective of this thesis is to examine how much an I-beam can be weakened without sacrificing safety and functionality. The investigation has been done by using Finite Element Method through commercial software. The regulation for structural design of building structures in Sweden used to be specified in the document known as BKR. But this was replaced by the European norm Eurocode back in May 2011. Starting from the transition between the norms, it is essential to investigate and define whether they differ and if so, what the consequences are of these possible differences. A secondary objective is therefore to define possible differences in structural design calculations between Eurocode 3 and BSK 07, which are the design rules for dimensioning of steel structures with Eurocode respectively BKR. The thesis work has been carried out in collaboration with Bjerking AB. The thesis has been divided into three sections: load calculations, structural design of single elements and finally the impact of the weakening by holes on bearing capacity. The following three structural elements have been studied:Â  Welded I-beam Welded I-beam with weakenings Truss beam The results from the structural design show that Eurocode demands more calculations than the BKR. However, Eurocode has in almost all cases indicated lower degree of utilization. This will most likely lead to lower material costs since less dimensions of structural elements is achieved. Eurocode has also showed lower limit for the effect of shear buckling during the structural design for shear resistance. The results from the analysis of the impact <b>of</b> <b>web</b> weakening on bearing capacity show that circular holes lead to higher bearing capacity than quadratic holes. Furthermore, the results show that the shear resistance <b>of</b> the <b>beam,</b> in principle, proportionally decreases with the area loss <b>of</b> the <b>beam</b> <b>web.</b> Regarding normal stresses, the analysis show that the most critical points to be considered in circular holes are at the very top and the very bottom of the edges of the hole where the largest compression stresses and tension stresses occur. Weakening <b>of</b> an I-beamâs <b>web</b> will also increase the vertical deformation <b>of</b> the <b>beam</b> in serviceability limit state but this increase of deformation is very small. The study has for example showed that a welded I-beam with span of 30 meters, height <b>of</b> 1300 mm, <b>web</b> thickness <b>of</b> 15 mm, flange width of 400 mm and flange thickness of 20 mm can accommodate 23 centered circular holes with diameter of 800 mm and center distance of 1200 mm without sacrificing safety and functionality.

30|$|The post-construction {{creation}} of {{an opening in the}} <b>web</b> <b>of</b> RC <b>beams</b> reduces the web cross-section and consequently reduces the flexural stiffness and shear capacity and increases the beam deflection at service load (Tan et al. 1996; Mansur 1998; Mansur et al. 1999).

The studies were performed using experiments (Mansur et al. 1999; Abdalla et al. 2003; El Maaddawy and Sherif 2009; Pimanmas 2010; Chin et al. 2011; Nie et al. 2018) and validated with nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis (Pimanmas 2010; Hawileh et al. 2012). Some of these studies are briefly described below.|$|R

A frequently used solution is to provide openings at the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beams</b> and girders to enable services to pass through. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to determine the angle of torsion of a flat-web (FW) profile steel section with openings of different shapes and sizes using LUSAS software. A model consisting of a FW profile <b>beam</b> steel section <b>of</b> five shapes and three sizes of openings has been developed. The shapes of opening are circle, square, regular octagon, C-hexagon, and regular hexagon. The sizes of the opening are 0. 5 D, 0. 6 D and 0. 8 D; D is the height <b>of</b> the <b>web.</b> Based on the results of the analytical investigations, the best shape of the opening is C-hexagon, and best size is 0. 5 D in resistance torsion compared with a FW profile section without opening. When the length <b>of</b> the <b>beam</b> section becomes longer, the value of the rotation angle increases. In general, the value of the angle of rotation for all shapes and sizes is close to the value of the angle of rotation for a FW profile without opening. Hence a flat-web section with opening is suitable in many cases to reduce cost and weight of steel...|$|R
40|$|The design <b>of</b> {{composite}} <b>beams</b> {{with large}} rectangular or circular openings {{is an important}} structural and practical problem which {{is caused by the}} need to pass service ducts through the structural zone of floor systems. Careful sizing and positioning of these openings in the beam webs can minimise their adverse effects on the shear and the bending resistances <b>of</b> composite <b>beams.</b> A design method [1][Lawson, RM. Design for openings in the <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> composite <b>beams.</b> The Steel Construction Institute/CIRIA joint publication SCI-P 068, 1987. ] for composite beams with large web openings was first formulated in accordance with BS 5950 and calibrated against full-scale tests in 1992 [2][Lawson RM, Chung KF, Price AM. Tests on composite beams with large web openings to justify existing design methods. Struct Eng 1992 : 70 (1). ]. With the release of the draft Eurocode 4 in 1994 [3][ENV 1994 - 1 - 1 : Eurocode 4 : design of composite steel and concrete structures. BSI, 1994. ], this paper re-presents the design method in the format of application rules to Eurocode 4 for detailed design <b>of</b> composite <b>beams</b> with large web openings. Moreover, the designer needs advice at the scheme design stage, and this paper also presents general information on sizing of openings {{as a function of the}} utilisation of the shear and the bending resistances <b>of</b> composite <b>beams.</b> Furthermore, the effect of these openings on deflections is estimated by a simple factor which is dependent on the size and the location of the openings. Typical design tables for composite beams with large rectangular openings are presented. Design rules for other forms of construction such as circular openings and notched beams are also presented with general detailing rules to assist designers.
