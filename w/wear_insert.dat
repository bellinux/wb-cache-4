40|$|AbstractImplant failure {{related to}} {{polyethylene}} wear remains {{an important issue}} in total knee arthroplasty. Polyethylene wear is usually assessed in vivo by measuring the remaining insert thickness on X-ray images of the knee. To reflect the amount of wear debris more accurately, a 3 -dimensional overlap measurement has been suggested, {{which is based on}} implant component models which are matched on calibrated stereo X-ray images using model-based roentgen stereophotogrammatic analysis. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of pose estimation, insert thickness deviation and variation in the femoral-tibial contact location on the accuracy and precision of the measurement using simulations and a phantom experiment. We found that the pose estimation was the largest source of variation. The 95 % prediction interval varied between 111 and 283 mm 3, which is approximately 100 – 200 % of the detected volumetric <b>wear.</b> <b>Insert</b> thickness variation resulted in prediction intervals of 74 – 174 mm 3. Variation of the femoral-tibial contact location in the phantom experiment gave a prediction interval of 40 mm 3. Large differences in the detected wear volume were found for different flexion angles. At most 56 % of the true wear volume was detected (129 of 230 mm 3, 30 ° of flexion). In summary, both the accuracy and precision of the volumetric wear measurement were low. The prediction interval of the volumetric wear measurement is at least as large as the measurement outcome itself.

The main goal in wearing earmolds is to attain better user comfort and efficiency. Earmolds (and their tubes) often turn yellow and stiff with age, and thus need replacement on a regular basis. The job of making earmoulds is very time-consuming and skilful; each one is made individually.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work was to design and {{evaluate}} a wear test method for cemented carbides inserts used in rotary drilling. An appropriate in-house wear test method would provide {{a better understanding of}} the wear mechanisms limiting tool life in real drilling. The test method should be easy to use and be able to distinguish between <b>wear</b> of <b>insert</b> materials with different microstructure and properties. The literature study showed few published articles about wear tests and mechanisms concerning rotary drill bit inserts. These methods included two standard wear tests; ASTM G 65 and ASTM B 611. Furthermore, a modified ASTM G 65 test was found as well as an impact-abrasion test. In this work the modified ASTM G 65 test, using a rock counter surface, was evaluated in order to understand if the method would mimic the wear of cemented carbides used in rotary drilling. The test method was further developed and showed high repeatability. Measured weight losses showed that the test could distinguish between two common rotary grade materials with a small difference in hardness but with different microstructures. The wear of the tested materials was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy and compared with rotary drill bit inserts collected from the field. The modified test method proved able to produce wear by mechanisms very similar to those found on field <b>worn</b> <b>inserts.</b> Identified <b>wear</b> mechanisms included cracking, fragmentation and spalling of WC grains as well as embedded fragments of WC grains on the surface.

40|$|AbstractThe wear of {{a cutting}} tool determines its life. Lesser the wear, more is the life of cutting tool and {{consequently}} the tool has to be replaced less frequently. This results {{in an increase in}} productivity of the machining operation, reduces manufacturing lead time and lowers the cost of production. Optimization of the process, use of cutting fluids for lubrication and hard coatings on the tool are the widely used methods to reduce tool wear. It has been recorded in previous studies that application of electric current to moving surfaces in contact, influences the wear of both the surfaces. The wear rate of the anodic surface was reduced and that of cathodic surface was increased.

The characteristics of the coating before and after the obligatory substrate heat treatment were first ascertained using various techniques including X-ray diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, fractography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, microhardness testing, profilometry, optical microscopy and scratch-adhesion testing. It was found that the characteristics of the TiN coating were not significantly affected by the substrate heat treatment and that they were comparable to those presented in the literature for similar C.

Comparison of the inserts with regard to tool life, tool wear, tool forces, apparent coefficient of friction, b. u. e. formation and workpiece surface finish, revealed that the TiN coated inserts had significantly improved cutting properties relative to the uncoated inserts.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A detailed study {{has been made of}} titanium carbide (TiC) coatings chemically vapour deposited on powder metallurgy (PM) BT 42 grade high speed steel (HSS) indexable cutting tool inserts, in collaboration with Edgar Allen Tools, Sheffield. Initially, the characteristics of a TiC coating deposited under the standard conditions employed by Edgar Allen Tools were determined, {{both before and after the}} obligatory HSS substrate heat treatment. This was done using various techniques including x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, micro-hardness testing, profilometry, optical microscopy and scratch-adhesion testing. Although the characteristics of the TiC coating were found not to be significantly affected by the HSS substrate heat treatment, some of them were different to those presented in the literature for TiC coatings chemically vapour deposited on cemented carbide substrates. A comprehensive survey of the literature revealed that the process parameters employed during the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of TiC coatings, particularly the CHy/TiCly mole ratio and deposition temperature, have a significant effect on coating characteristics. Consequently, it was decided to investigate the effect of these parameters on the characteristics of the TIC coatings chemically vapour deposited on the PM HSS inserts and, further, their effect on the tool lives exhibited by the coated inserts. The latter were determined from a series of turning tests on 817 M 40 workpiece material, carried out under conditions of builtup- edge (bue) formation, at cutting speeds in the range 37. 5 - 60 m min 1. Both process parameters were found to have a marked effect on the characteristics of the TiC coatings and on the tool lives exhibited by the coated inserts. The reasons for this are discussbd. The TiC coated inserts which displayed the most favourable combination of coating characteristics and tool life were used in two further series of turning tests carried out to investigate tool wear, bue size, tool forces, apparent coefficient of friction and workpiece surface finish. Uncoated inserts were also tested. The application of the TiC coating was found to have led to a marked improvement in the cutting properties of the PM HSS inserts.

40|$|Purpose: For years, {{numerous}} studies have been performed to determine whether mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (MB-TKA) or fixed-bearing total knee arthroplasty (FB-TKA) is the preferential design in total knee arthroplasty. Reviews and meta-analyses on this subject have focused on {{a relatively small number}} of randomised controlled trials, possibly missing important results of smaller studies. The goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of all literature comparing MB-TKA and FB-TKA in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Methods: An extensive literature search was performed in the PubMed database. All studies that compared MB-TKA with FB-TKA and looked at one of four theorised advantages (<b>insert</b> <b>wear,</b> signs of loosening, survival rate of the prosthesis and clinical outcome) were included. Results: The initial search yielded 258 articles, of which 127 were included after the first screening. The included studies consisted of 9 meta-analyses, 3 systematic reviews, 48 RCT’s, 44 comparative studies, 10 reviews and 13 studies that examined patients who received bilateral TKA (one MB-TKA and one FB-TKA). Combining the results of all studies showed that almost all studies found no difference between MB-TKA and FB-TKA. Conclusions: Even when examining all different types of studies on MB-TKA and FB-TKA, the results of this review showed no difference in <b>insert</b> <b>wear,</b> risk of loosening, survivorship or clinical outcome. In daily practice, the choice between MB-TKA and FB-TKA should be based on the experience and judgment of the surgeon, since no clear differences are observed in the scientific literature.
