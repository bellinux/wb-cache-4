5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

25|$|An easy {{exercise}} in linear algebra shows that any even dimensional vector space admits a linear complex structure. Therefore, an even dimensional manifold always admits a (1, 1) rank tensor pointwise (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> linear transformation on each tangent space) such that J'p2 = −1 at each point p. Only when this local tensor can be patched together {{to be defined}} globally does the pointwise linear complex structure yield an almost complex structure, which is then uniquely determined. The possibility of this patching, and therefore existence of an almost complex structure on a manifold M is equivalent to a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle from GL(2n,R) to GL(n,C). The existence question is then a purely algebraic topological one and is fairly well understood.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} {{years of the}} ULFA {{movement}} (when it used to enjoy widespread public support in both {{urban and rural areas}} of Assam), cadres were recruited from rural areas as well as from many towns in Lower Assam, Upper and middle Assam districts. One of the most popular ULFA leader of all time, the late Heerak Jyoti Mahanta hailed from a place <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few kilometres from the state capital Guwahati. However, with the Assamese urban middle class becoming increasingly sceptical of ULFA's method of functioning, the ULFA targeted the remote villages and the tribal areas for recruitment. According to intelligence sources, the Paresh Baruah faction of the Ulfa, which have been continuously raising its voice against the ongoing peace process being initiated by the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction, is engaged in a massive recruitment drive in the rural areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur and Nalbari districts of Assam.

25|$|Mary Lefkowitz has criticised this research. She {{suggests}} {{that some of the}} research was done not to determine the reliability of the dating method, as was suggested, but to back up an assumption of age and to make certain points about pyramids and Greek civilization. She notes that not only are the results not very precise, but that other structures mentioned in the research are not in fact pyramids, e.g. a tomb alleged to be the tomb of Amphion and Zethus near Thebes, a structure at Stylidha (Thessaly) <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> long wall, etc. She also notes the possibility that the stones that were dated might have been recycled from earlier constructions. She also notes that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia was ignored. She argues that they undertook their research using a novel and previously untested methodology in order to confirm a predetermined theory about the age of these structures.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{represent}} permutations of n is by an integer N with 0nbsp&≤nbsp&Nnbsp&<nbsp&n!, provided convenient methods {{are given to}} convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when n is small enough that N can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&12, and for 64-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers d'n, d'n−1, …, d2, d1, where d'i is a non-negative integer less than i (one may omit d1, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express N in the factorial number system, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> particular mixed radix representation, where for numbers up to n! the bases for successive digits are n, , …, 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a Lehmer code or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.|$|E
