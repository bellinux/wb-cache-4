A contest sponsored by Keep Walking Brazil project selected 30 proposed covers, and Sapienza was chosen by Madonna after being among the ten finalists.

On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> right. They do what they're told to do. They do it with a really good heart. They do the best they can. They don't ask for anything." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Social Darwinism" [...] {{was used}} {{infrequently}} {{from around the}} 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by Richard Hofstadter to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like William Graham Sumner who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, {{it has been used}} as a term of abuse by those opposed to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> the moral consequences of evolution.|$|R

[...] "They've made up their minds, or <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> minds, that we're guilty; but principally they're out for a sensation. They want to see {{something}} die, and we're it. I doubt if anything could stop them now; they'd think we'd cheated them if we suddenly proved beyond doubt that we were innocent." ...|$|R
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The God Delusion" [...] {{explores the}} {{unproven}} beliefs that {{are treated as}} factual by many religions and the extremes to which some followers have taken them. Dawkins opens the programme by describing the [...] "would-be murderers ... who want to kill you and me, and themselves, because they're motivated by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the highest ideal." [...] Dawkins argues that [...] "the process of non-thinking called faith" [...] is not a way of understanding the world, but instead stands in fundamental opposition to modern science and the scientific method, and is divisive and dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increased}} media exposure {{was difficult}} for Fox, who acknowledged being shy and insecure, to adjust to. It also positioned her as a potential role model, and later led to her being typecast. She stated that people sometimes avoided her to remain out of the media's spotlight, {{and that she was}} a different role model for girls that maybe America was not comfortable with. She rejected the notion of preaching to kids about appropriate behaviors, or about what women should be, but said that she could make young girls feel [...] "strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> right." [...] Fox viewed her constant references to sex as feminist commentary and not simply headline-seeking, and wanted women and young girls to believe that it was okay to feel sexy and find power in that. She did not view being typecast as attractive as bad and felt that it can enable her to surprise people when she gives a good performance in a film, and inspire her to be an overachiever, but said she is interested in portraying less sexualized characters. MTV's Craig Flaster said that although Fox has [...] "been typecast as the big-budget sex symbol", she has shown comedic range.|$|E

50|$|Cambodia is a source, transit, and {{destination}} country for human trafficking. The traffickers are reportedly organized crime syndicates, parents, relatives, friends, intimate partners, and neighbors. Despite human trafficking being {{a crime in}} Cambodia, the country has a significant child sex tourism problem; some children are sold by their parents, while others <b>are</b> lured by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> legitimate job offers like waitressing, but then are forced into prostitution. Children are often held captive, beaten, and starved to force them into prostitution.|$|R

50|$|The YBM/AVY was {{launched}} officially at a Breton Party Congress in Blain, in March 2007.

At their launch, the Young Bretons published the « Young Bretons Manifesto », in which <b>they</b> denounce <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> France’s failures on the political, economical and cultural fields. They criticized the French attitude towards Europe and the failure of decentralization and public reforms in general, and called out to « emancipation » and reunification of Brittany, within a federal Europe.|$|R
60|$|Let us {{add another}} consideration. One reason {{why so many}} persons are really shocked and pained by the avowal of heretical {{opinions}} is {{the very fact that}} such avowal is uncommon. If unbelievers and doubters were more courageous, believers would be less timorous. It is because they live in an enervating fool's paradise of seeming assent and conformity, that the breath of an honest and outspoken word strikes so eager and nipping on their sensibilities. If they were not encouraged to suppose that all the world is of their own mind, if they were forced out of that atmosphere of self-indulgent silences and hypocritical reserves, which is systematically poured round them, they would acquire a robuster mental habit. They would learn to take dissents for what they are worth. They would be led either to strengthen or to discard their own opinions, if the dissents happened to be weighty or instructive; either to refute or neglect such dissents as should be ill-founded or insignificant. They will remain valetudinarians, so long as a curtain of compromise shelters them from the real belief of those of their neighbours who have ventured to use their minds with some measure of independence. A very brief contact with people who, when the occasion comes, do not shrink from saying <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> enough to modify that excessive liability to be shocked at truth-speaking, which is only so common because truth-speaking itself is so unfamiliar.|$|E
