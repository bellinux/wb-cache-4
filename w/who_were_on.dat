Jochi, however, had become ill, which meant no reinforcements would be coming.|$|E
5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the side of the status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|A {{party of}} 40 senior German {{officers}} and civilians <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> {{a tour of}} Campbeltown were killed. In total, the explosion killed about 360 men.

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E
5|$|SAS Flight 347 was a scheduled, {{domestic}} flight from Bardufoss Airport via Bodø Airport to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Check-in and boarding ran as normal, without any security check. At Bardufoss, 122 people boarded the aircraft, including {{a large group}} of soldiers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> leave of absence and on their way home to Southern Norway. Representatives from the ground handlers stated that none of the passengers acted suspiciously.|$|E
5|$|Since the SBS {{joined the}} UKSF Group in the 1980s, {{it has been}} restructured. Instead of one {{squadron}} being tasked with a permanent role the unit adopted the same system of squadron rotation as the SAS.

For example, in December 2001 it was C squadron <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> MCT Role and were called in to intercept the MV Nisha while M and Z Squadron were deployed in Afghanistan.|$|E

Fuqua, the ship's damage control officer, earned the Medal of Honor for his cool-headedness while quelling fires and getting survivors off the wrecked battleship. Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor {{also went to}} two high-ranking officers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> board the battleship when it was destroyed, Rear Admiral Isaac C.

Arizona was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Bernese troops {{under the}} command of Sigmund von Erlach then {{advanced}} from Bern to the Aargau to meet the forces of Zürich. Under this double pressure, the peasants' resistance collapsed. Von Erlach's troops numbered about 6,000 men and 19 cannons. The operation was a veritable punitive expedition: the troops plundered the villages along their way and even razed the defenses of the small town of Wiedlisbach, which lost its town privileges and was declared a village again. On June 7, 1653, the Bernese army met with a troop of about 2,000 men of Leuenberger's army <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> their way back from Wohlenschwil. The peasants retreated to Herzogenbuchsee, where they were defeated by von Erlach's troops; the little town went up in flames {{in the course of the}} battle. Niklaus Leuenberger fled and went hiding, but he was betrayed by a neighbour and was apprehended by the Bernese district sheriff Samuel Tribolet on June 9, 1653.|$|E
5|$|By 1606 {{the missionaries}} had {{concentrated}} many Manche Ch'ols in nine new mission towns, and {{had started to}} penetrate {{the territory of the}} neighbouring Mopan Maya, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Petén. By 1628 the Dominicans were tending to 6,000 Maya in the part of Manche Ch'ol territory that they had gained access to. This figure included some apostate refugees from Spanish-controlled Cahabón. Estimates of the total Manche Ch'ol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to the high-end estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the Manche Ch'ol, driving them away from the mission towns.|$|E

5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1798 Sérurier {{temporarily}} {{commanded the}} divisions left in Italy {{where he had}} his hands full trying to calm unpaid soldiers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria {{because he was too}} old. Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he handed it over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the Tyrol Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rain and}} winds buffeted many parishes located {{east of the}} city of New Orleans. A small radius {{near the center of the}} storm had much of the extreme rainfall, and limited the flooding, which could have been {{disastrous}} if it were widespread. Grand Isle and portions of the lower Plaquemines Parish were the worst hit in Louisiana. Additionally, Grand Isle reported a wind gust of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a storm surge of 5.2 feet (1.6 m). At New Orleans International Airport, sustained winds of 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts of 33 mph (53 km/h) were reported on July 19. A gauge reported a water level of 4.85 feet (1.5 m) in Venice. Storm tides were 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) above normal on average. A Coast Guard helicopter had to evacuate 7 Texans <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> a yacht in the Gulf of Mexico forty miles offshore, since their radio was broken and they were therefore unaware they were sailing into the storm. After being rescued, they were treated for minor injuries at a suburban New Orleans hospital.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.|$|E

India were well beaten, losing 4–0, {{three of the}} four defeats by an innings. Miller was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries, while the batsmen ahead of him plundered the bowling. His bowling duties were also light; his 72overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. In both his fifties, Miller featured in century partnerships with his partners, respectively Bradman and Hassett in the First and Fourth test respectively. His 58 in the First Test at Brisbane featured many big hits.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> foot, and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May, the RUF {{blocked the}} road {{connecting}} Freetown to Lungi Airport, prompting UNAMSIL staff to evacuate to the Mamy Yoko Hotel {{in preparation for}} a total withdrawal from Sierra Leone if the RUF advance continued towards Freetown. In response to the deterioration Richards requested that British troops be sent to Dakar, Senegal, to decrease the time required to launch an operation in Sierra Leone. Richards also spoke to the 1 PARA command to update them on the situation. Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the Air Movements Centre in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated Joint Task Force Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment. At the same time, the authority to launch an evacuation operation was delegated to Richards and the British High Commissioner, Alan Jones.|$|E
