30|$|That {{does not}} mean that {{emergency}} services take measures only if the impacts reach a certain threshold of tolerance. In contrast, it seems that most kinds of actions take place almost all the time during the development of an event as they compare their different information sources. Severe weather events are a common hazard and there is a consciousness and knowledge about what might happen as the potential impact of such an event. In general, reactive behavior seems to be due to the self-understanding of the organization since it has to be lightly “proactive” when it is permanently on stand-by, ready for an alarm and ready to act. Likewise, Demeritt et al. (2013, p. 154) argued in the context of European flood forecasting that one reason “agencies have sometimes set quite high confidence thresholds for issuing flood warnings is that <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibility</b> is public safety.” Thus, they focus on short-term warnings to support response measures such as public evacuations, rather than on medium-term forecasting in supporting mitigation (Demeritt et al. 2013). It seems that in this context, the weather warning only serves as confirmation of what is already planned and decided on.|$|R
40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} is a problem which is increasingly drawing attention in society. The authority responsible for providing care and support to victims of intimate partner violence and their children is the social services. The {{purpose of this study}} was to show how social workers deal with intimate partner violence and to create a description of how this work is currently carried out in seven municipalities in the north-west of Stockholm. This was done through a quantitative survey including all investigating social workers in the municipalities concerned. The results were analysed with concepts from organizational theory. The findings showed that there is a need for further education related to intimate partner violence. The differences observed between the municipalities were derived mainly to the presence of a coordinator for issues concerning violence against women. Furthermore, results showed that social workers believe that the best possibilities to help victims of intimate partner violence lay outside the own organization. To better fulfil <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibility</b> regarding intimate partner violence the next step for the municipalities would be to make sure that social workers gain further knowledge about intimate partner violence...|$|R

The special susceptibility of children to certain environmental hazards as well as the changing nature of childhood illness have prompted the Clinton Administration to make children’s health a high priority. In September 1996, the EPA established a seven step National Agenda to Protect Children’s Health from Environmental Threats. In April 1997, President Clinton issued an Executive Order requiring all federal agencies to make the protection of children a high priority in implementing <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and fulfilling <b>their</b> overall missions.

It traces the development of federal water pollution control legislation before 1972, highlighting the deficiencies that contributed to the need for a new approach in 1972. It then examines the scientific and technical, political, and legal assumptions that helped shape the 1972 Clean Water Act in an effort to determine whether the failure to achieve fully the statute’s goals is inherent in the statute’s design or is more likely the result of the law’s incomplete implementation. The article concludes that a surprisingly large share of the assumptions upon which Congress built the Clean Water Act were valid and have helped to make the statute an environmental success story. The statute’s failure to perform even more admirably than it has is due largely to a lack of legislative clarity in addressing the role of wetlands in preserving the integrity of aquatic ecosystems and to Congress’ unwillingness to adopt, or force the states to adopt, measures to control nonpoint source pollution...|$|R

The powers of governing bodies included, amongst others, the appointment, promotion and even dismissal of an educator. Some governing bodies were {{of the opinion that}} they had total power, without taking the Act on Educational Affairs (70 / 1988) and the Act on Employment of Educators (138 / 1994) into consideration. Other governing bodies, however, proceeded cautiously not to transgress these Acts. In the literature study the essence, composition and powers of the governing body were described.

40|$|With burgeoning caseloads and {{persistent}} vacancies in many federal courts, senior judges {{play a vital}} role in the continued well-being of our federal judiciary. Despite the importance of their participation in the judicial process, however, senior judges raise a host of constitutional concerns that have escaped the notice of scholars and courts. Many of the problems originate with recent changes to the statute authorizing federal judges to elect senior status, including a 1989 law that permits senior judges to fulfill <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> by performing entirely nonjudicial work. Others arise from the ambiguity of the statutory scheme itself, which seems to suggest that senior status represents a separate constitutional office, requiring reappointment, even though senior judges nominally retain judicial office under federal law. In the first scholarly article addressing the constitutionality of senior judges, the authors examine two general constitutional objections: (1) whether the requirement that senior judges be designated and assigned by another federal judge before performing any judicial work violates the tenure protection of Article III; and (2) whether allowing judges to elect senior status, without a second intervening appointment, violates the Appointments Clause. They also examine whether two specific types of senior judges - the bureaucratic senior judge who performs only administrative duties and the itinerant senior judge who sits exclusively on courts outside his home district or circuit - violate the Constitution. The authors conclude that the current statute authorizing senior judges raises serious constitutional problems that should be addressed by Congress or the Judicial Conference of the United States. In that respect, they formulate a number of straightforward suggestions to repair senior status without having to sacrifice any of the considerable benefits that senior judges have conferred on the federal judiciary over the years...|$|R

The current regulatory body, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) will merge with the Healthcare Commission and the Mental Health Act Commission to create the Care Quality Commission. The Department of Health (DOH) is currently reviewing the future regulation of health and adult social care in England (DOH, 2005; DOH, 2006 a) and the way that CSCI carries out the regulation and inspection of a range of social care agencies including care homes for older people. Substantial reforms of the regulatory system of regulation and inspection were embodied in the Care Standards Act (CSA) 2000 that was part of the wider Government agenda to modernize health and social care services. The Act established new regulatory bodies for care services and workers and along with the regulations and mandatory National Minimum Standards (NMS) created a framework to ensure greater consistency of quality and to better protect vulnerable children and adults (Engelman and Spencer, 2003). The impact of these changes for both inspectors and providers of care services has been significant.

40|$|Since the {{political}} changes in Eastern Europe took place, banks {{in this region}} have experienced a significant reorganization in structure, core activities and business understanding. These changes {{have led to the}} development of banking entities which are flexible, open to the new banking perspectives and react promptly to market changes. However, extensively growing Central and Eastern European (“CEE”) markets require financial sources to meet the increasing demand for core banking intermediation. In order to maintain future growth banks will search for funding instruments which allow them to grow without having a balance sheet effect. In this respect structured finance (especially asset securitisation) may be a solution for these banks and also for other institutions looking for diversified funding sources or credit risk mitigants. It is expected that trend to use securitisation structures will gain on importance due to the decrease in the availability of core funding instrument which are currently deposits. CEE banks’ customers are becoming more aware of possibilities on how to allocate their capital efficiently therefore conventional banking and battle for traditional funding sources will become more expensive. Although, recent market turbulences have significantly reduced the demand for structured finance products in developed economies, the role of these instruments will not lose on importance in the future. The growing sophistication of CEE banking industry will force banks to create products which enable them to attract liquidity by more advanced means. Covered bonds, ECB repurchase agreements and privately placed securitisation transactions can give flexibility towards active balance sheet management in the times of significant liquidity problems. The development organisations like KfW, EBRD, IFC or FMO due to <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> can serve as intermediaries and “market maker” investors.

40|$|The role {{of social}} workers in intercountry {{adoption}} An analysis {{of the experience of}} adopters from Romania many agencies and professionals against intercountry adoption, based on a con-cern about transracial and transcultural placements. For some authorities the sudden influx of applications to adopt from Romania created a new level of demand, challenging existing practice and resulting in authorities having hastily to decide their response (BAAF, 1991). <b>Their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibility</b> in these cases was unclear. There was considerable regional variation among authorities, with some refusing to undertake any home studies and others responding positively. During 1990 the Secretary of State clarified the position and notified social services of their duty to complete home studies within a fixed time period. Intercountry adoption presents a different model of practice from that of domestic adoption. Principally, it is a closed model of adoption, generally of young children, and involves a complete change of a child’s environment to a different country. The local authority or agency has little involvement in the placement of children from overseas apart from the process of approval for entry clearance, and the welfare supervision before adoption in the UK. The Department of Health and the Home Office check the application for entry clearance to ensure that proper consent and approval have been obtained. At the time of the Romanian Revolution, the Romanian adoption laws were not recognised by the UK. Conse-quently the adoptive parents had to complete the adoption process in Romania and then apply to re-adopt the child in the UK, when she or he had been living with them for a year. The child was technically a private foster child until the application, then a protected child People who adopted children from Romania between 1990 and 1992 experienced considerable difficulties arranging the adoptions, both in Romania and the UK.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of environmental {{law and policy}} typically proceeds {{in the face of}} scientific uncertainty. Despite this pervasive uncertainty, Congress has directed environmental and resource management agencies to ground their policy decisions in science. Agencies sometimes cope with the paradox of making science-based decisions in the face of uncertainty by using scientific models or other surrogacy techniques to simulate reality. Such simulation enables agencies to conform to <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to base decisions on scientific considerations, even though a complete understanding of the relationships between their actions and the resulting environmental effects may be beyond their current capabilities. This article considers the lessons that may be drawn from one federal agency 2 ̆ 7 s shifting approach to the use of models and surrogates. It explores the efforts by the United States Forest Service to comply with the mandate in the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities in its planning processes. To minimize the uncertainty it faces in predicting what impact a particular action, such as a timber sale, will have on the biological diversity, the Forest Service has used models and surrogates. Initially, the agency used the impact of planned activities on management indicator species (MIS) as a surrogate for the impact of those activities on biodiversity in the affected area. More recently, it has relied on analysis of the impact of planned activities on the habitat of MIS as a surrogate for the affects of its activities on biodiversity. This article explores the Forest Service 2 ̆ 7 s shifting approach to {{implementation of}} the NFMA 2 ̆ 7 s diversity mandate to illustrate the benefits and disadvantages of using scientific models and surrogacy techniques to make science-based decisions in the face of uncertainty.

This allows us to reject the hypothesis that SSCs are incident on workers, at least locally around kinks. Additionally, we exploit the large variations in SSC rates across kinks and years to estimate the local incidence of both employer and employee SSCs around these thresholds.

Valid alternate bases for relief include award of an injunction when a compliance plan does not encompass the full range of an agency’s activities, or when an agency fails to demonstrate compliance with an existing plan.

Recent guidance exhorts professionals to coordinate and collaborate more consistently {{in this area of}} work. The present study aimed to identify the barriers to inter-professional collaboration through a survey of 500 health and social care professionals. The views of 11 mothers with severe mental health problems whose children had been subject to a child protection case conference were also interrogated through two sets of interviews. The study found that communication problems were identified more frequently between child care workers and adult psychiatrists than between other groups. Communication between general practitioners and child-care workers was also more likely to be described as problematic. While there was some support amongst practitioners for child-care workers to assume a coordinating or lead role in such cases, this support was not overwhelming, and reflected professional interests and alliances. The mothers themselves valued support from professionals whom they felt were ‘there for them’ and whom they could trust. There was evidence from the responses of child-care social workers that they lacked the capacity to fill this role in relation to parents and <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> child-care <b>responsibilities</b> may make it particularly difficult for them to do so.

The state-aided school has assumed a juristic personality with the governing body, as the representative of the state-aided school, being vested with the management, control and executive power of the school. The consequence has been that the govern 1 ng body, while being vested with greater powers, is also in a position of having to assume the legal responsibility for those powers. The governing body, therefore, in its management of the state-aided school, has to work within the framework of the law, as set out in the Education Affairs Act (House of Assembly) 70 of 1988, and according to the Regulations made in terms of the Act No. 70 of 1988. This study is directed at analysing the Act (70 / 1988) and the Regulations in order to identify those sections of the law which have a direct bearing on the responsibilities of the governing body. Thereafter data from an empirical study as used to determine if the governing bodies of secondary schools are aware of <b>their</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> if they understand those responsibilities, and in the practical management of the school, if they meet the requirements of the law. A questionnaire based on the analysis of the Act (70 / 1988) and the Regulation was compiled. Information received from the principals of the sample schools, in their capacity as members of the governing body, was used to tabulate the data, analyse the results and draw certain conclusions. The most important findings of the investigation are as follows: * Governing bodies appear to have a reasonable knowledge of how to handle certain limited, practical situations in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Act (70 / 1988) and the Regulations. * Governing bodies adhere by-and-large to the requirements regarding official and administrative documentation. * However, according to the assessment of Headmasters, as executive members of the governing body, in the case of a majority of governing bodies, their overall knowledge, understanding and interpretation of the provisions of the Act (70 / 1988) and the Regulations made in terms of the Act,. as well as of related legislation, seems to be lacking. This finding casts a doubt on the ability of some governing bodies to meet the <b>statutory</b> requirements of <b>their</b> management task. The conclusion was reached, that governing bodies in general will have to make a concerted effort to study the statutory provisions of the Act (70 / 1988) and the Regulations, as well as related legislation, which have a specific bearing on their managerial task in the state-aided school.
