METHODS: Two groups of women of normal <b>weight</b> before pregnancy (body mass index [BMI] 19. 6 - 25. 4 kg/m 2) {{took part in the}} study (n = 200). They gained either moderate <b>weight</b> (9 - 15 kg) or high <b>weight</b> (18 - 24 kg) during pregnancy. From maternity records and telephone interviews, information on age, height, prepregnancy and postpartum <b>weight,</b> gestational <b>weight</b> gain, babies' birth <b>weights,</b> lactation, parity, and smoking habits was collected. RESULTS: High maternal <b>weight</b> gain during pregnancy resulted in mean birth <b>weight</b> 286 g higher than that of babies of mothers who gained moderate <b>weight.</b> The correlation coefficient between birth <b>weight</b> and gestational <b>weight</b> gain was 0. 3 (P. 05). CONCLUSION: High gestational <b>weight</b> gain among women of normal <b>weight</b> before pregnancy increases birth <b>weight</b> and women's <b>weight</b> postpartum, compared with moderate <b>weight</b> gain. Prepregnant <b>weight</b> is more indicative of postpartum <b>weight,</b> and women reach normal <b>weight</b> again irrespective of gestational <b>weight</b> gain...|$|R

Although {{behavioural}} {{interventions are}} successful in achieving short-term <b>weight</b> loss, most individuals regain {{most or all of}} their <b>weight</b> within a few years. Our aim was to investigate factors that can help in long-term <b>weight</b> maintenance. Design.

Participants were 20 adult volunteers (aged 30 - 67) including lifelong <b>weight</b> maintainers, active <b>weight</b> maintainers who have maintained <b>weight</b> loss, and <b>weight</b> gainers. Thematic analysis was used to highlight differences between <b>weight</b> groups. Results. Successful <b>weight</b> maintainers adopt a staged approach to <b>weight</b> management, including monitoring <b>weight</b> fluctuations and having a clear alarm signal for <b>weight</b> gain that triggers immediate action. They have several behavioural strategies for <b>weight</b> control, comprising relatively small adjustments to diet and/or exercise behaviour and also have clear strategies for coping with lifestyle interruptions.

Further, their coping strategies for <b>weight</b> gain or failed actions are poor. Conclusions. The results suggest that successful <b>weight</b> maintainers, irrespective of current <b>weight</b> band, adopt a staged behavioural approach to <b>weight</b> management that allows them to maintain a fairly stable <b>weight.</b> Encouraging the use of such strategies in those who typically regain <b>weight</b> after dieting may aid them in maintaining <b>weight</b> loss...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} the dwarfing gene (dw) on egg <b>weight,</b> chick <b>weight,</b> and chick weight: egg <b>weight</b> ratio were studied. Egg <b>weights</b> prior to setting and {{subsequent}} chick <b>weights</b> were determined on 1842 chicks from standard-sized broiler breeder dams and 1694 chicks from closely related dwarf dams. Egg <b>weight</b> means were 67. 3 and 63. 0 g for standard and dwarf dams, respec-tively. Chick <b>weights</b> expressed as percentage of egg <b>weight</b> were 68. 4 and 67. 3 % for standard and dwarf dam chicks, respectively. Both egg <b>weight</b> and chick weight: egg <b>weight</b> ratio differences were highly significant (P<. 01). Percent hatch <b>weights</b> {{of male and female}} chicks, 68. 0 and 67. 7 %, respectively, were also significantly different (P<. 05). Regression analysis of egg <b>weight</b> on chick <b>weight</b> estimated the overall equation: chick <b>weight</b> = — 6. 13 g +. 78 X egg <b>weight.</b> A significant positive linear relationship between chick weight: egg <b>weight</b> ratio and egg <b>weight</b> was detected; males increased more than females and dwarf dam chicks more than standard dam chicks.
