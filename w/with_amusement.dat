5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated <b>with</b> <b>amusement,</b> so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|Baseball and Bloomers, {{also known}} as Baseball in Bloomers, is a 1911 American silent short sports film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film stars William Garwood and is the debut of Marguerite Snow. The film focuses on a female seminary which organizes a baseball club and challenges another school to a game. The boys accept to the game <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> and find that the women are not good at baseball. Two Harvard University baseball stars {{join the ranks of}} the girls in disguise and defeat the boys team. The script may have been written by Lloyd Lonergan and the film may have been directed by Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. The film was released on January 6, 1911 and it received positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral on a Sunday. Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March. The main {{business}} of the council was the debate {{on a number of}} canons, or rules, for the church that would be announced. Most of these were not new decrees, having been promulgated by Eugene's predecessor at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139. All of the proposed canons were approved, except for one on clerical attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics. This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur. Another canon condemning clerical marriage was greeted <b>with</b> <b>amusement,</b> as the council members felt that all clergy should already know that marriage was forbidden to them.|$|E

After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local Claire's to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part, Faith on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When she began her work on that series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive emancipation to work the production's long hours. She later recalled <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of that show, jokingly {{said that she would}} sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku.|$|E
25|$|Cold Food Festival; this solar-based holiday on April 5 (concurrent {{with the}} Qingming Festival) was named so because no fires {{were allowed to}} be lit for three days, hence no warmed or hot food. It was a time to respect one's {{ancestors}} by maintaining their tombs and offering sacrifices, while a picnic would be held later in the day. It was also a time for fun in outdoor activities, <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> on swing sets, playing cuju football, horse polo, and tug of war. In the year 710, Emperor Zhongzong of Tang had his chief ministers, sons-in-law, and military officers engage {{in a game of}} tug of war, and purportedly laughed when the oldest ministers fell over. The imperial throne also presented porridge to officials, and even dyed chicken and duck eggs, similar to the practice on Easter in the Western world.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, Bianu's stance {{changed over}} several years. In 1896, with Sturdza as Prime Minister, Bianu {{participated in the}} {{rapprochement}} with Austria-Hungary. During the state visit to Romania of Emperor Franz Joseph, Sturdza sent Bianu, Grigore Antipa, Ștefan Sihleanu and Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea to Vârciorova, where they were to meet Austrian delegates ahead of the Cultural League. The two Romanian delegations clashed which each other, an incident which was reported <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> in the Bucharest press. Bianu also continued {{to work for the}} Bucharest National Liberal club during the next decade, helping Sturdza win over Junimea from the Conservatives. During the elections of 1905, he backed the Junimist candidate Titu Maiorescu and, in return, obtained Junimeas support for the National Liberal Petru Poni. Bianu and Poni remained close friends {{for the rest of their}} lives. Bianu also used his influence for advancing many other scholarly goals, such as when, in 1909, he brought to Romania Ramiro Ortiz, who founded the Bucharest school of Italian studies.|$|E
25|$|In {{their work}} as {{cultural}} campaigners, Vinea and Janco even collaborated with 75 HP, a periodical edited by poet Ilarie Voronca, which was nominally anti-Contimporanul and pro-Dada. Janco was also an occasional presence {{in the pages of}} Punct, the Dadaist-Constructivist paper put out by the socialist Scarlat Callimachi. It was here that he notably published articles on architectural styles and a lampoon, in French and German, titled T.S.F. Dialogue entre le bourgeois mort et l'apôtre de la vie nouvelle ("Cablegram. The Dialogue between a Dead Bourgeois and the Apostle of New Living"). In addition, his graphic work was popularized by Voronca's other magazine, the Futurist tribune Integral. Janco was also called upon by authors Ion Pillat and Perpessicius to illustrate their Antologia poeților de azi ("The Anthology of Present-Day Poets"). His portraits of the writers included, drawn in sharply modernist style, were received <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> by the traditionalist public. In 1926, Janco further antagonized the traditionalists by publishing sensual drawings for Camil Baltazar's book of erotic poems, Strigări trupești lîngă glezne ("Bodily Exhortations around the Ankles").|$|E

500|$|The Era also lavishly praised Emma Howson as Josephine. The Entr'acte and Limelight {{commented that}} the opera was {{reminiscent}} of Trial by Jury and Sorcerer but found it diverting and called the music [...] "very charming. To hear so-called grand opera imitated {{through the medium of}} the most trifling lyrics, is funny". The paper praised Grossmith as Sir Joseph, noting <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> that he was made up to look like portraits of Horatio Nelson, [...] "and his good introductory song seems levelled at" [...] W. H. Smith. It opined, further, that [...] "He Is an Englishman" [...] is [...] "an excellent satire on the proposition that a man must necessarily be virtuous to be English".

500|$|When {{the first}} patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine {{recalled}} that the crowd—most {{of whom were}} homosexual—had grown to at least ten {{times the number of}} people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet. Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, [...] "Gay power!", someone began singing [...] "We Shall Overcome", and the crowd reacted <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> and general good humor mixed with [...] "growing and intensive hostility". An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author Edmund White, who had been passing by, recalled, [...] "Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing." [...] Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.|$|E

[...] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that proposed Republican relaxation of Wall Street regulations would [...] "put y'all back in chains" [...] led to a similar analysis of Biden's face-to-face campaigning abilities versus tendency to go off track. [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Most candidates give the same stump speech over and over, putting reporters if not the audience to sleep. But during any Biden speech, there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe, and prompt reporters to turn to each other <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> and confusion."

He was ordered back to London to explain the Madrid {{incident}} to his superiors but, after setting out on the ship Ariosto, the convoy was torpedoed by a U-boat on [...] The Ariosto {{was one of three}} ships sunk in the engagement, although he escaped harm and returned to Gibraltar. Rather than attempting another trip to London, Clarke was interviewed by the Governor of Gibraltar, Lord Gort, who judged Clarke's answers acceptable and concluded that [...] "we can reasonably expect that this escapade and its consequences will have given him sufficient shock to make him more prudent in the immediate future". It is unclear why Clarke was wearing a dress, but reports of the incident indicated he had been following a lead and gone a little too far in his spy-craft.

500|$|White Dog {{quickly became}} a bestseller in the United States after its English release. Phoebe Adams of The Atlantic felt the story was ironic, and noted that it was [...] "presumably" [...] true. She felt the {{depiction}} of Marlon Brando was [...] "tartly funny" [...] and that story as a whole served [...] "as an excuse for Mr. Gary's comments on racial affairs in this country, a matter on which is somewhat less pessimistic than the natives {{and a good deal}} more sensible." [...] The Globe and Mails H. J. Kirchhoff considered it a [...] "riveting, thoughtful work" [...] that serves as a metaphor for American racism. Julien Roumette felt Romain's depiction of the racial tensions in America at the time was [...] "meticulously reconstituted, with a realistic, even documentary, rather exceptional dimension." [...] Julia Weldon of Harper's Magazine remarked <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> that the events of the novel were ones that [...] "only a Frenchman" [...] could have found himself in. She felt the novel was a [...] "decathlon event" [...] in which Gary turned a [...] "household crisis into a full-scale allegory." [...] Overall, she praised the book as a [...] "memorable portrait of guilt and largess in black and white", noting she felt Gary had lived to [...] "witness his own maturity" [...] though she also wondered if he stretched the truth to [...] "make himself a legend in his own time." [...] It should be noted that all of these commentators are white and not in the least African-American nor have they lived the Black experience.|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, the Beatles had {{experienced}} popularity {{since the start}} of 1963. But in the United States, Capitol Records, owned by the band's record company EMI, had for most of the year declined to issue any of the singles. The phenomenon of Beatlemania in the UK was regarded <b>with</b> <b>amusement</b> by the U.S. press, once it made any comment. When newspaper and magazine articles did begin to appear towards the end of 1963, they cited the English stereotype of eccentricity, reporting that the UK had developed an interest in something that had come and gone a long time ago in the United States: rock and roll. Headlines included [...] "The New Madness" [...] and [...] "Beatle Bug Bites Britain", and writers employed word-play linking [...] "beetle" [...] with the [...] "infestation" [...] afflicting the UK. In late 1963, Capitol Records agreed to release the single [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] with a large accompanying promotional campaign, due to Ed Sullivan's agreement to headline the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Beatles' American television debut was on 18 November 1963 on The Huntley-Brinkley Report, with a four-minute long piece by Edwin Newman. On 22 November 1963, the CBS Morning News ran a five-minute feature on Beatlemania in the UK which heavily featured their then current UK hit [...] "She Loves You". The evening's scheduled repeat was cancelled following the assassination of JohnF. Kennedy the same day. On 10 December, Walter Cronkite decided to transmit the piece again on the CBS Evening News, and the resulting interest led to the rush-release of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] and—only weeks before the Beatles' arrival—a U.S. commercial breakthrough.|$|E
