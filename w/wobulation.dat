5000|$|... <b>wobulation</b> is {{used only}} {{to double the}} {{horizontal}} resolution of a display, unlike CRT interlacing that doubles the vertical resolution. However, <b>wobulation</b> is capable of doubling the vertical and horizontal resolution of an image (2× <b>wobulation).</b>|$|E
5000|$|While <b>wobulation</b> can {{in theory}} {{be used in}} many types of display devices, it is {{currently}} primarily used in displays using Digital Light Processing (DLP). DLP is a Texas Instruments (TI) technology which relies on a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) chip. TI calls its implementation of <b>wobulation</b> 'SmoothPicture'. Horizontal <b>wobulation</b> used in current TI products allows a DMD chip with a 960×1080 mirror array to produce a 1920×1080 pixel picture; most recent designs employed in 3D DLP sets use [...] "offset-diamond pixel layout", where the mirrors form a [...] "checkerboard pattern" [...] array. [...] Also, the image overlap inherent {{in the use of}} <b>wobulation</b> eliminates the 'screen door' effect common on other fixed pixel displays such as plasma and LCD, but may in some implementations also create some reduction in sharpness. <b>Wobulation</b> is used by a number of TV manufacturers, including Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi, RCA, Samsung, and Toshiba.|$|E
50|$|In large-screen {{television}} technology, <b>wobulation</b> is Hewlett-Packard's {{term for}} a form of interlacing designed for use with fixed pixel displays. The term is loosely derived from the word 'wobble' and was inspired by HP's work with the overlap of printing ink. <b>Wobulation</b> reduces the cost and complexity of components required {{for the creation of}} high resolution TVs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wobulation</b> {{technology}} used in TVs is becoming obsolete, as manufacturers {{shift away from}} producing rear projection TVs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wobulation</b> {{is a term}} {{which refers}} to the known {{variation}} (or wobble) in a characteristic. For example, the term is used to describe advanced radar waveform modulations - where the repetition rate or centre frequency of a signal is changed in a repetitive fashion to reduce the probability of detection.|$|E
50|$|DLP 3D {{technology}} {{uses the}} SmoothPicture <b>wobulation</b> algorithm and {{relies on the}} properties of modern 1080p60 DMD imagers. It effectively compacts two L/R views into a single frame by using a checkerboard pattern, only requiring a standard 1080p60 resolution for stereoscopic transmission to the TV. The claimed advantage of this solution is increased spatial resolution, unlike other methods which cut vertical or horizontal resolution in half.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wobulation</b> {{works by}} {{overlapping}} pixels. It does so by generating multiple sub-frames of data while an optical image shifting mechanism (e.g. {{the mirror of}} a digital micromirror device) then displaces the projected image of each sub-frame by {{a fraction of a}} pixel (e.g. one-half or one-third). The sub-frames are then projected in rapid succession, and appear to the human eye as if they are being projected simultaneously and superimposed. For example, a high-resolution HDTV video frame is divided into two sub-frames, A and B. Sub-frame A is projected, and then the miniature mirror on a digital micromirror device switches and displaces sub-frame B one half pixel length as it is projected. When projected in rapid succession, the sub-frames superimpose, and create to the human eye a complete and seamless image. If the video sub-frames are aligned so that the corners of the pixels in the second sub-frame are projected at the centers of the first, the illusion of double the resolution is achieved, like in an interlaced CRT display. Thus a lower resolution fixed pixel device using <b>wobulation</b> can emulate the picture of higher resolution fixed device, at a reduced cost.|$|E
50|$|In DLP projectors, {{the image}} is created by microscopically small mirrors {{laid out in a}} matrix on a {{semiconductor}} chip, known as a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). These mirrors are so small that DMD pixel pitch may be 5.4 µm or less. Each mirror represents one or more pixels in the projected image. The number of mirrors corresponds to the resolution of the projected image (often half as many mirrors as the advertised resolution due to <b>wobulation).</b> 800×600, 1024×768, 1280×720, and 1920×1080 (HDTV) matrices are some common DMD sizes. These mirrors can be repositioned rapidly to reflect light either through the lens or onto a heat sink (called a light dump in Barco terminology).|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{the diamond}} pixels {{used on the}} DLP {{projection}} system provide some unusual benefits/tradeoffs. In a nutshell, the diamond pixels make computer graphics at native resolution a more [...] "grainy" [...] (by a tiny amount) at native resolution but, at compressed resolutions, much better than compression on a square pixel grid. Movies displayed at native resolution have no noticeable difference, but movies at 1080p are exceptionally accurate (for not being [...] "true" [...] 1080p). When projecting a 1920x1080 sized computer graphical user interface (GUI), the text remains readable and is overall surprisingly faithful to what a full 1080p display would produce. The diamond pixel layout achieves this effect using a property of human vision and recognition similar in spirit, although not mathematically, to the psychoacoustics used to compress MP3s. No <b>wobulation</b> is used; this effect is purely enabled by {{the shape of the}} pixel.|$|E
5000|$|The micromirrors are {{organized}} in a so-called [...] "offset-diamond pixel layout" [...] of 960×1080 micromirrors, rotated 45 degrees, with their center points {{placed in the}} center of [...] "black" [...] squares on the checkerboard. The DMD employs full-pixel <b>wobulation</b> to display the complete 1080p image as two half-resolution images in a fast sequence. The DMD operates at twice the refresh rate, i.e. 120 Hz, and the complete 1080p picture is displayed in two steps. On the first cadence, only half of the original 1080p60 image is displayed - the pixels that correspond to the [...] "black" [...] squares of the checkerboard pattern. On the second cadence, the DMD array is mechanically shifted (wobulated) by one pixel, so the micromirrors are now in a position previously occupied by the gaps, and another half of the image is displayed - this time, the pixels that correspond to the [...] "white" [...] squares.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor {{optimizing}} {{sensitivity and}} RF excitation, high resolution NMR probes {{have to be}} tuned at the Larmor frequency and matched to 50 Ω-transmission lines {{to which they are}} connected. For achieving this setting, one usually resorts to the <b>wobulation</b> function which consists in sweeping the frequency of the power source while monitoring and minimizing the reflected power taken from a directional coupler through adjusting the tuning and matching capacitors. However, the presence of a transmission-reception switch between the directional coupler and the probe leads to the appearance of extra loss and reactance, and affects the determined values of the previous mentioned capacitors. Even if this situation is usually satisfactory, the true tuning-matching condition is required for optimal NMR sensitivity and for reliable spectra analyses when nonlinear effects are present (radiation damping, spin-noise experiments, etc.). To circumvent the need of network analyzer directly attached to the probe for finding this optimal tuning-matching condition, in the current work, we report a procedure which combines <b>wobulation</b> and choice of a transmission-line phase shift obtained by a variable phase shifter inserted between the probe and the switch. The technique was successfully validated with help of a network analyzer. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part B (Magn Reson Engineering) 45 B: 59 – 68, 201...|$|E
