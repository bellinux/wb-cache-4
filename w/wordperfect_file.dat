50|$|Pivotal {{conversion}} {{is similarly}} {{used in other}} areas. Office applications, when employed to convert between office file formats, use their internal, default file format as a pivot. For example, a word processor may convert an RTF file to a <b>WordPerfect</b> <b>file</b> by converting the RTF to OpenDocument and then that to WordPerfect format. An image conversion program does not convert a PCX image to PNG directly; instead, when loading the PCX image, it decodes it to a simple bitmap format for internal use in memory, and when commanded to convert to PNG, that memory image is converted to the target format. An audio converter that converts from FLAC to AAC decodes the source file to raw PCM data in memory first, and then performs the lossy AAC compression on that memory image to produce the target file.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} POL Report 56 {{was constructed}} in 1999 using Wordperfect for the text {{in the body of}} the report. Printouts of that and the separate figures were then combined and the whole report printed by a commercial printer (copies may still be available from the POL Library). Unfortunately, no pdf was made at the time. In order to make this pdf now, and because POL does not use Wordperfect any longer, I have had to read the old <b>Wordperfect</b> <b>file</b> with Word, with the result that sections and footnotes etc. are not always laid out as before (and look a little messy in places). Apologies for that but I think no information has been lost...|$|E

It could load and save <b>Wordperfect</b> <b>files</b> created on any platform, such as IBM, Macintosh and Apple II.

5000|$|Little is {{currently}} still {{heard about the}} Pekoteko. Nowadays the terminological work is accomplished quite differently, and the Pekoteko files are no longer directly usable. Some Esperantists, however, {{thought it was a}} great pity that the information contained therein was no longer readily available. It is possible that someone might now discuss correct terminology without knowing that the same discussion had already taken place 20 years earlier. In 2006, therefore, Bernhard Pabst converted the former <b>WordPerfect</b> <b>files</b> in his possession to a plain-text format, which he and André Weber then supplemented with additional entries. Pabst then converted the text file to PDF and made it available for download [...] "to quickly and easily provide the public with information, not to recreate a perfect Pekoteko but only to provide basic control of the content." ...|$|R
5000|$|By 1987 a {{magazine}} described WordPerfect as [...] "a {{standard in the}} MS-DOS world ... a powerhouse program that includes almost everything". On 6 November 1989, WordPerfect Corporation released the program's most successful version, WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS, {{which was the first}} version (aside from the short-lived WordPerfect 5.0) to include (text-based) Macintosh-style, CUA-style, pull-down menus to supplement the traditional function key combinations, support for tables, a spreadsheet-like feature, and full support for the typesetting options (italic, redline, strikeout, etc.) permitted by laser printers. This version of WordPerfect included, as a [...] "Print preview", a graphical representation of the final printed output. (This was the foundation for WordPerfect 6.0's graphic screen editing.) The data format used by WordPerfect 5.1 was, for years, the most common word processing file format. All word processors could read (and convert) that format, and many conferences and magazines insisted that people ship their documents in 5.1 format. To allow older DOS-based PCs to utilize the new <b>WordPerfect</b> 6 <b>file</b> format, <b>WordPerfect</b> 5.1+ for DOS was introduced. This version could read and write <b>WordPerfect</b> 6 <b>files,</b> included several 3rd party screen and printing applications (previously sold separately), and provided several minor improvements.|$|R
40|$|The {{proceedings}} {{for this}} conference will be prepared directly from electronic copy submitted by authors to an online submission Website. The manuscript submission deadline is September 4, 2007. NO EXTENSIONS WILL BE GIVEN. Unlike in years past, papers not {{submitted by the}} deadline will {{not appear in the}} official conference proceedings. Information on the electronic submission process will be provided under separate cover. The new process requires authors to upload an MSWord, <b>WordPerfect</b> or PostScript <b>file</b> directly to a Website where the document is turned into a PDF file, which is used in the printed product. As such, please note that authors are entirely responsible for the content of papers submitted for inclusion in the proceedings. IS&T will no longer proofread papers or check to make sure fonts and graphics reproduce well. This {{is the responsibility of the}} author. To ensure a visually pleasing and technically accurate final product, authors must format their papers according to IS&T specifications as described below and found in the author template (link at bottom of page at www. imaging. org/conferences/guidelines. cfm).

40|$|Consider multidim. universes M= R x M_ 1 x [...] . x M_n with D = 1 + d_ 1 [...] + d_n, where M_i of {{dimension}} d_i are of have constant curvature {{and compact}} for i> 1. For Lagrangian models L(R,phi) on M which depend only on Ricci curvature R and a scalar field phi, there exists an explicit description of conformal equivalence, with the minimal coupling {{model and the}} conformal coupling model as distinguished representatives of a conformal class. For the conformally coupled model we study classical solutions and their relation to solutions in the equivalent minimally coupled model. The domains of equivalence are separated by certain critical values of the scalar field phi. Furthermore the coupling constant xi of the coupling between phi and R is critical at both, the minimal value xi= 0 and the conformal value xi_c={D- 2 }/{ 4 (D- 1) }. In different noncritical regions of $xi$ the solutions behave qualitatively different. For vanishing potential of the minimally coupled scalar field we find a multidimensional generalization of Kasner's solution. Its scale factor singularity vanishes in the conformal coupling model. Static internal spaces in the minimal model become dynamical in the conformal one. The nonsingular conformal solution has a particular interesting region, where internal spaces shrink while the external space expands. While the Lorentzian solution relates to a creation of the universe at finite scale, it Euclidean counterpart is an (instanton) wormhole. Solving the Wheeler de Witt equation we obtain the quantum counterparts to the classical solutions. A real Euclidean quantum wormhole is obtained in a special case.
