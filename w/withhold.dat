5000|$|Typically the <b>withholding</b> tax {{is treated}} as a payment {{on account of the}} recipient's final tax liability, when the <b>withholding</b> is made in advance. It may be {{refunded}} if it is determined, when a [...] is filed, that the recipient's tax liability to the government which received the <b>withholding</b> tax is less than the tax withheld, or additional tax may be due if it is determined that the recipient's tax liability is more than the <b>withholding</b> tax. In some cases the <b>withholding</b> tax {{is treated as}} discharging the recipient's tax liability, and no tax return or additional tax is required.

5|$|In April 1863, food {{shortages}} led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order.

5|$|In October 1975, the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, {{determined}} to <b>withhold</b> supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills. With Field on leave (his Senate appointment having been challenged), the Coalition had an effective majority of 30–29 in the Senate. The Coalition {{believed that if}} Whitlam could not deliver supply, and would not advise new elections, Kerr would have to dismiss him. Supply would run out on 30November.|$|E
50|$|Another {{purpose of}} Form W-9 {{is to help}} the payee avoid backup <b>withholding.</b> The payer must collect <b>withholding</b> taxes on certain {{reportable}} payments for the IRS. However, if the payee certifies on the W-9 they are not subject to backup <b>withholding</b> they generally receive the full payment due them from the payer. This is similar to the <b>withholding</b> exemptions certifications found on Form W-4 for employees.|$|R
50|$|Some {{countries}} require <b>withholding</b> by the purchaser of real property.

Canada imposes similar rules for 25% <b>withholding,</b> and <b>withholding</b> on sale of business real property is 50% of the price, but may be reduced on application.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withholding</b> {{taxes on}} {{interest}} grants the source country its share in tax revenue. As tax interest payments to lenders are lowered on an after tax basis, <b>withholding</b> taxes are not attractive {{from the perspective}} of a company. Therefore, in countries with higher <b>withholding</b> tax rates lenders demand higher before tax interest rates from debtors. Enterprises in countries with low <b>withholding</b> taxes can raise foreign debt at lower cost.|$|R

5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to <b>withhold</b> royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to <b>withhold</b> royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Among the U.S. {{delegation}} to the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City, Keyes was selected by Reagan as deputy chairman.

Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing {{the size of the}} organization somewhat.

5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply <b>withhold</b> that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} tax {{withheld}} {{is based on}} the amount of payment subject to tax. <b>Withholding</b> of tax on wages includes income tax, social security and medicare, and a few taxes in some states. Certain minimum amounts of wage income are not subject to income tax <b>withholding.</b> Wage <b>withholding</b> is based on wages actually paid and employee declarations on Federal and state Forms W-4. Social Security tax <b>withholding</b> terminates when payments from one employer exceed the maximum wage base during the year.|$|R
50|$|Many jurisdictions require persons paying {{amounts to}} nonresidents to collect tax due from a nonresident {{with respect to}} certain income by <b>withholding</b> such tax from such {{payments}} and remitting the tax to the government. Such levies are generally referred to as <b>withholding</b> taxes. These requirements are induced because of potential difficulties in collection of the tax from nonresidents. <b>Withholding</b> taxes are often imposed at rates differing from the prevailing income tax rates. Further, the rate of <b>withholding</b> may vary by type of income or type of recipient. Generally, <b>withholding</b> taxes are reduced or eliminated under income tax treaties (see below). Generally, <b>withholding</b> taxes are imposed on the gross amount of income, unreduced by expenses. Such taxation provides for great simplicity of administration but can also reduce the taxpayer's awareness {{of the amount of}} tax being collected.|$|R
5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced ministers to <b>withhold</b> money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E

For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and <b>withhold</b> names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, Governor Stanley {{announced}} {{publicly that}} {{the main thrust of}} his legislative proposal would be to <b>withhold</b> funds from any local school district which integrated. In response, Gray called a meeting of the Gray Commission to consider the governor's proposal. Stanley said he would not oppose the Gray Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of factors other than race (which might lead to some integration). Stanley's concession, the Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that the Gray Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal.|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} {{to crack down on}} {{offshore}} tax evasion, the United States is implementing a new set of information reporting and <b>withholding</b> requirements on foreign banks and other foreign entities. These provisions, known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, require thirty percent <b>withholding</b> of the entity’s U. S. -source income, unless they disclose specific information regarding their customers’ identities and account balances. While this may be an effective way to force foreign institutions into compliance, it also raises questions about how it will function within existing tax reporting systems, where the function of <b>withholding</b> serves a materially different purpose. The FATCA reporting and <b>withholding</b> provisions depart from the norm of using <b>withholding</b> as a tax enforcement mechanism, and instead use it as a coercive compliance measure. This Comment looks to current domestic and international <b>withholding</b> systems as a point of comparison for this new regime. By examining the objectives and operation of these existing systems as compared to those of FATCA, it becomes clear that <b>withholding</b> income serves a drastically different purpose. Existing systems utilize <b>withholding</b> as a means of ensuring that taxes will be paid, while FATCA implements {{it as a way to}} force foreign banks to comply with a set of reporting requirements. Considering this is the first time <b>withholding</b> appears to be used in this way, it is prudent to ask whether this is a desirable use of <b>withholding</b> in our current international taxation system. This Comment posits that, without significant revision to account for conflicts arising with pre-existing obligations, converting the accepted concept of <b>withholding</b> into a drastically different punitive measure is both undesirable and unacceptable...|$|R

40|$|We use firm-level {{administrative}} data from Ecuador {{to study the}} implications of 'reverse withholding' for firms' tax behavior. <b>Withholding</b> does not affect tax liability of firms, but it {{may result in a}} discontinuity in the audit probability around the <b>withholding</b> threshold.

To explore the link between bunching and evasion, we use data from third party reports on sales and costs. We show that the firms that bunch are more likely to conceal their sales and inflate their costs. Finally, we create a profile of the firms that bunch and of their general managers: medium size firms in the coastal region headed by single males are significantly more likely to bunch and, presumably, to evade taxes. <b>Withholding,</b> Reverse <b>Withholding,</b> Firms, Profit Tax, Bunching, Tax Evasion, Ecuador...|$|R
