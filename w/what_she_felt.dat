5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|In Pride's first book, The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality, she chronicled {{her journey}} {{away from what}} she argued were feminist and anti-natal ideas of happiness, within which she had lived as an activist before her {{conversion}} to conservative evangelical Christianity in 1977. She described her discovery of happiness surrounding <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was the Biblically mandated role of wives and mothers as bearers of children and workers in the home {{under the authority of}} a husband. Pride argued that such a lifestyle was Biblically required of married Christian women but that most had been unknowingly duped by feminism. She meanwhile countered in the book various versions of Christian feminism.|$|E
25|$|Wanda Rogers, who had {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} personal problems for some time, became unreliable and difficult to work with. Concert scheduling was difficult as she sometimes failed to turn up for performances. In 1970, Rogers recorded songs for a solo album, produced by Smokey Robinson and including covers of earlier Motown recordings, which Motown decided to market as The Return of The Marvelettes. As this album featured no other Marvelettes, original member Katherine Anderson refused to participate in appearing {{on the cover of the}} album due to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was Motown's disrespect towards her and the group. The album was only a modest hit, reaching #50 on the R album charts and featured no charted hit singles. Following this, the group disbanded with Katherine Anderson settling briefly as a staff writer for Motown. After Motown moved to Los Angeles in 1972, Anderson and Rogers left the business altogether returning to Michigan with Anderson settling in her hometown of Inkster while Rogers moved to Southfield, Michigan. Meanwhile, Gladys Horton had moved to Los Angeles where she raised her three sons.|$|E
25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E

From Taylor's perspective, police procedurals were often filled with not only technical inaccuracies, but <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> were inaccuracies of how officers behaved, saying: [...] "that's what really irritates me in other dramas– detectives crying over dead bodies and getting drunk senseless. You'd last about two weeks". She said, of her time {{as a police officer}} in comparison to portrayals on television, that [...] "reality is much more interesting.

500|$|With her sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997), Mariah Carey started infusing hip-hop music {{elements}} in her songs, working with different and younger record producers and songwriters. After the album's success, {{and the release}} of her first compilation album #1's (1998), Carey began to work on her seventh studio album, Rainbow (1999). Her main focus on the album was to continue on the same path she began with on Butterfly, producing a subtle combination between inspirational ballads and hip-hop beats. [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] marked the first time in Carey's career that a hip-hop star was included on a lead single, following O.D.B. who was featured on the official remix of [...] "Fantasy" [...] in 1995.

500|$|While in India, Sherwood wrote {{a series}} of texts based on colonial life. Her most popular work, The History of Little Henry and his Bearer (1814), {{tells the story of}} a young British boy who, on his deathbed, {{converts}} Boosy, the Indian man who has taken care of him throughout his childhood. The book was enormously successful; it reached 37 editions by 1850 and was translated into French, German, Spanish, Hindustani, Chinese, and Sinhalese. Sherwood's tale blends the realistic with the sentimental and introduces her readers to Hindustani words and descriptions of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was authentic Indian life. As Cutt explains, [...] "with this work, the obituary tract (which invariably stressed conversion and a Christian death) had assumed the colouring of romance." [...] Sherwood also wrote a companion story titled [...] Little Lucy and her Dhaye (1825) that told a similar tale but from a little girl's perspective.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the consultation between Kerr, Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and the British Parliament were not part of the discussion. Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen in 1975, Sir William Heseltine, who along with Charteris informed her of the dismissal, has maintained that it came as a surprise to all three of them; that he considered Kerr's actions imprudent; and that he believed that this opinion was shared by Charteris. A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion, and that disillusionment with Kerr's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation. The Queen's opinion is unknown, but Heseltine has stated: [...] "I think she is an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt,</b> I think she felt the same ...

500|$|... "My Father's Song" [...] was a {{brand new}} song {{recorded}} specifically for Streisand's seventeenth studio album, Lazy Afternoon (1975). Produced by Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes, the latter had written the song after Streisand had told him different stories about her childhood and growing up with her father; the songwriting process consisted of Streisand sharing personal tales of her father and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> about him. Streisand worked closely with Holmes during {{the creation of the}} album. Prior to their collaboration, Holmes was considered to be relatively unknown. After finishing up with Holmes and in order to thank him for the collaborations, Streisand hand-wrote him a note that read, [...] "Dear Rupert, don't be frightened, you're the best, love Barbra". In the official liner notes of Lazy Afternoon, she stated that the track was [...] "a very personal gift [...] mean a great to deal to me"; responding to her comments in a 1988 interview with a Streisand fan, Holmes claimed that the process was simple and that he had only [...] "put in [...] everything that a daughter might want to hear her father say" [...] in the lyrics.|$|E

[...] She was greatly drawn to the [...] "daredevil" [...] role, for which she had no qualms about shaving her head. Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by [...] "the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work.

500|$|Angel season four {{played with}} audience's {{expectations}} of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, [...] "I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy." [...] She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though; [...] director Terrence O'Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode [...] "Orpheus" [...] because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new [...] "schizophrenic madwoman" [...] characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a [...] 2004 convention he admitted that the season four storyline [...] "freaked him out." [...] The episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite {{the birth of the}} child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] she is left in a coma {{for the remainder of the}} fourth season. Crusie discusses <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a Dynasty reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.|$|E
