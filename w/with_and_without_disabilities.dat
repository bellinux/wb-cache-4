Here we reported the survey result with subjects of five prefectures in the Hokushin-etsu District such as Nagano, Niigata, Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui mentioned below: The following views commanded a majority in elementary and junior high schools with the registration of children with disability: ＊“Physical education is important”for children, effective for children with disability to understand“ the relationships with the other children”, <b>and</b> for children <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> to “understand handicaps”. ＊Many teachers cited“children are getting to enjoy and like physical activities”as objectives of physical education, while a few cited“children are getting to improve motor skills” as the objective. ＊Seventy percent of elementary and junior high schools did let children <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> together participate in school events on sports. ＊Many teachers were looking forward to obtaining knowledge on sports for the disabled as well as joining training sessions on this subject. ＊Many teachers considered difficult to progress physical education for children <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> together smoothly in a regular class for the following reasons: children <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> were hardly satisfied with the lesson of physical education with children with disability; the lesson with children with disability should be a burden on children <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> it is difficult to conduct team events of children <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> together...|$|R

50|$|Almost one fifth (19%) of working-age {{people with}} {{disability}} who {{were employed in}} 2009 worked as professionals, followed by clerical and administrative workers,and technicians and trade workers (both 15%). The distribution of people across different occupations is similar for people <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> However, there was some variation of occupations according {{to the type of}} disability. For example, around one third (34%) of employed people with intellectual disability were working as labourers, such as cleaners, in 2009, while one-fifth (20%) of employed people with sensory or speech disability were in professional occupations, such as secondaryschool teachers. Both people <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> had similar distributions across industry groups. Some industries had a higher than average (10%) disability prevalence rate, particularly Agriculture, forestry and fishing (15%) and Transport, postal and warehousing (12%). This may be partly reflective of the older age profile of people in these industries. People with disability who were working were more likely to run their own business (13%), and/or work from home (9%), than employed people <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> (10% <b>and</b> 6% respectively). Such situations may enhance the flexibility of working arrangements, making it easier for people with disabilityto participate in the labour force.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Panel {{data are}} often used to {{estimate}} key measures of public health, such as years lived <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Panel surveys commonly measure disability at intervals {{of one or two}} years, and occasionally more than two. It is likely that these intervals often include unreported changes in functional status. Unreported changes may bias estimates of disability transition probabilities, which are commonly used to estimate years lived <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Most surveys do not ask participants about periods <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> in the time since they last responded to the survey. We examined a way to improve the usefulness of panel surveys and our understanding of disability processes, by eliciting retrospective disability information. Methods Data were from the United States' National Long Term Care Survey. At each wave, this survey asks disabled respondents how long they have been disabled. We tested whether estimates of probabilities predicting changes in disability status can be improved by making use of this retrospective disability information. Methods included embedded Markov Chain analysis, microsimulation, and the Hausman specification test. Results Estimates based on data that include retrospective information are significantly different from those that use only the more limited information that is contemporaneous to the surveys. They are also more efficient. At age 65, all estimated probabilities for becoming disabled were higher when retrospective information was used, and all probabilities for remaining disabled were lower. Microsimulation revealed that using retrospective information increased the number of functional status transitions. For example, for women the mean number of transitions from nondisabled to disabled or dead was 52. 7 % greater when retrospective information was added to the analysis. Conclusion Our results suggest that the value of future panel studies for estimating transitions in disability could be notably enhanced by adding a small number of questions asking respondents for details about their disabilities–and lack of disabilities–in the period since a preceding survey wave. Information provided by such questions could substantially improve both the measurement of disability histories and estimates of disability processes. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{effects of}} non-occupational {{physical}} activity were assessed {{on the number}} of years lived <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> between age 50 and 80 years. METHODS: Using the GLOBE study and the Longitudinal Study of Aging, multi-state life tables were constructed yielding the number of years <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> between age 50 and 80 years. To obtain life tables by level of physical activity (low, moderate, high), hazard ratios were derived for different physical activity levels per transition (non-disabled to disabled, non-disabled to death, disabled to non-disabled, disabled to death) adjusted for age, sex and confounders. RESULTS: Moderate, compared to low non-occupational physical activity reduced incidence of disability (HR 0. 66, 95 % CI 0. 51 to 0. 86), increased recovery (HR 1. 95, 95 % CI 1. 32 to 2. 87), and represents a gain of disability-free years and a loss of years with disability (male 3. 1 and 1. 2; female 4. 0 and 2. 8 years). Performing high levels of non-occupational physical activity further reduced incidence, and showed a higher gain in disability-free years (male 4. 1; female 4. 7), but a similar reduction in years with disability.
