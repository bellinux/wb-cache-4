500|$|At Franz Joseph's request, Zita and her {{children}} left their residence at Hetzendorf and moved into a suite of rooms at Schönbrunn Palace. Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia {{at the age of}} 86 on 21 November 1916. [...] "I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband," [...] Zita later recounted, [...] "and, with tears in his eyes, making {{the sign of the cross}} on Charles's forehead. As he did so he said, 'May God bless Your Majesty.' It was the first time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the Imperial title used to us." ...|$|E
500|$|Vanderbilt captain Alf Adams {{praised the}} Tech team: [...] "Tech's {{magnificent}} machine won easily over Vanderbilt. It {{was simply the}} matter of a splendid eleven winning over an unseasoned, inexperienced team. Tech played hard, clean football, and we were somewhat surprised to meet such a fair, aggressive team, after the reports <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard.</b> I think that Vanderbilt could have broken that Tech shift if we had had last year's eleven. Being outweighed, Vanderbilt could not check the heavy forwards, or open up the line. Thereby hangs the tale." [...] Tech's starting lineup was Guill (left end), Fincher (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Carpenter (right tackle), Bell (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his death Beiderbecke was little known except among fellow musicians, and for several years critics paid little {{attention}} to his music. As Jean Pierre Lion has pointed out, [...] "The only serious and analytical obituary to have been published in the months" [...] after his death was by a Frenchman, Hugues Panassié. The notice appeared in October 1931 and began with a bit of hyperbole and an incorrect fact, two hallmarks of much of the subsequent writing about Beiderbecke: [...] "The announcement of Bix Beiderbecke's death plunged all jazz musicians into despair. We first believed it was a false alarm, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> so often before about Bix. Unfortunately, precise information has been forthcoming, and we even know the day—August 7—when he passed away." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the opening}} of the Bucharest Conference on June 21, 1960, which was held on the {{occasion}} of the Third Congress of the Romanian Communist Party, Hoxha was not among the various heads of communist parties and states in attendance; Politburo member Hysni Kapo took his place. The stated purpose of the Conference was to have [...] "the character of a preliminary meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties, mainly for the purpose of 'exchanging opinions' and taking a joint decision on the date and place of a future meeting of the communist and workers' parties of the world." [...] In his memoirs Hoxha describes the Conference as being [...] "putsch" [...] and adds, [...] "The revisionist renegades needed another meeting of international communism to gain approval for their old plan for the final legitimization of modern revisionism," [...] he did not attend because [...] " [...] suspected that the problem of the differences which had emerged between China and the Soviet Union would be discussed... <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> only one side of the argument, the Soviet side, and we were not acquainted with the objections of the Chinese... They had to be thrashed out thoroughly, they had to be studied carefully, and time was required for this. Therefore our Party sent Comrade Hysni Kapo to Bucharest to discuss only the date of the future meeting," [...] for decisions besides this date were not to be taken at the Conference itself.|$|E
500|$|The Escapist, {{thinking}} {{the issues of}} a year past had died down, especially since they hadn't aroused much concern on first coming to light, did not expect the discord that ensued; response on their forums was heated, and the ESRB took [...] "vigorous exception" [...] to the piece. Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, the first thing <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. That sounded like a mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E

Jean-Hervé Peron of Faust says: [...] "We were trying to put aside everything <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> in rock 'n' roll, the three-chord pattern, the lyrics. We had the urge of saying something completely different." [...] According to Peel, the only American or British band to [...] "clearly influence" [...] the genre was England's Pink Floyd, particularly for their [...] "spacey music".|$|E

2500|$|Other gifts {{were also}} given to his neighbours. Among these was one to Chartres, of which its bishop wrote: [...] "When {{we saw the}} gift that you sent us, we were amazed at your {{knowledge}} {{as well as your}} faith… since you, whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> to be a pagan prince, we now know to be not only a Christian, but also a most generous donor to God's churches and servants". He is known to have sent a psalter and sacramentary made in Peterborough (famous for its illustrations) to Cologne, and a book written in gold, among other gifts, to William the Great of Aquitaine. This golden book was apparently to support Aquitanian claims of St Martial, patron saint of Aquitaine, as an apostle. Of some consequence, its recipient was an avid artisan, scholar and devout Christian, and the Abbey of Saint-Martial was a great library and scriptorium, second only to the one at Cluny. It is likely that Cnut's gifts were well beyond anything we can now know.|$|E
2500|$|Movie Maker Magazine {{asked the}} producers, [...] "Voices of Iraq {{is truly a}} {{groundbreaking}} film—both {{in terms of its}} content and the process behind its production. What was your main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. [...] For years <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors. Second to that, the 35 mm blow-up." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that [...] "they’d cleaned the place up and hired an RN [...] for our visit. We only saw first-trimester procedures." [...] She adding that [...] "Unfortunately, some women don't know where to turn. You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don't know {{that they do have}} other (safe) options." [...] A {{spokesperson for}} Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, [...] "We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone’s health... All women should have access to high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions." [...] Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn't heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced. She has been quoted as stating that [...] "when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health." [...] She clarified that [...] "when Gosnell was arrested, I asked our staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell's facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities".|$|E

2500|$|Following Coleridge's {{response}} was an anonymous {{review in the}} May 1820 Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, possible by either John Lockhart and John Wilson together or just Lockhart on his own. Of Wordsworth's abilities as a poet in general, the review claimed: [...] "Mr Wordsworth ... is entitled to be classed with the very highest names among his predecessors, as a pure and reverent worshipper of the true majest of the English Muse" [...] and that [...] "Of the genius of Mr Wordsworth, in short, it {{is now in the}} hands of every man to judge freely and fully, and for himself. Our own opinion, ever since this Journal commenced, has been clearly and entirely before them; and if there be any one person, on whose mind what we have quoted now, is not enough to make an impression similar to that which our own judgment had long before received– we have nothing more to say to that person in regard to the subject of poetry." [...] In discussing the ode in particular, the review characterised the poem as [...] "one of the grandest of his early pieces". In December 1820 came an article in the New Monthly Magazine titled [...] "On the Genius and Writings of Wordsworth" [...] written by Thomas Noon Talfourd. When discussing the poem, Talfourd declared that the ode [...] "is, to our feelings, the noblest piece of lyric poetry in the world. It was the first poem of its author which we read, and never shall we forget the sensations which it excited within us. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the cold sneers attached to his name... and here – in the works of this derided poet – we found a new vein of imaginative sentiment open to us – sacred recollections brought back to our hearts with all the freshness of novelty, and all the venerableness of far-off time". When analysing the relationship between infants and the divine within the poem, the article continued: [...] "What a gift did we then inherit! To have the best and most imperishable of intellectual treasures – the mighty world of reminiscences of the days of infancy – set before us in a new and holier light".|$|E
