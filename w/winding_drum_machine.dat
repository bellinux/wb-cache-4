Fiber fitted onto freely-spinning unwinding creel. Unwinds from creel between two tension bars onto guide spools, aligns fiber so properly enters sealed reservoir of resin. Stainless-steel metering die at entrance to reservoir aligns fiber and seals reservoir. Beneficial results obtained by use of reservoir made of polyethylene. Composite material made from resin matrices reinforced by fibers have great potential for solving challenging and often critical problems in design of spacecraft, space structures, and terrestrial structures...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the result}} of their {{robustness}} and compact size, rhythm machines were gradually installed on electronic organs as accompaniment of organists, and finally spread widely. Ace Tone <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> {{found their way into}} popular music starting in the late 1960s, followed by Korg and Roland <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> in the early 1970s. The first major pop song to use a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> was [...] "Saved by the Bell" [...] by Robin Gibb, which reached No. 2 in Britain in 1969. It used a [...] "slow rock" [...] rhythm preset on Ace Tone's FR-1 Rhythm Ace. The German krautrock band Can also used a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> on their song [...] "Peking O" [...] (1971), which combined acoustic drumming with Ace Tone's Rhythm Ace <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b> The first album on which a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> produced all the percussion was Kingdom Come's Journey, recorded in November 1972 using Ace Tone's Bentley Rhythm Ace. Timmy Thomas' 1972 R&B single [...] "Why Can't We Live Together"/"Funky Me" [...] featured a distinctive use of a Roland <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> and keyboard arrangement on both tracks.

50|$|A <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> is an {{electronic}} musical instrument designed {{to imitate the}} sound of drums, cymbals, other percussion instruments, and often basslines. <b>Drum</b> <b>machines</b> either play back prerecorded samples of drums and cymbals or synthesized re-creations of drum/cymbal sounds in a rhythm and tempo that is programmed by a musician. <b>Drum</b> <b>machines</b> are most commonly associated with electronic dance music genres such as house music, but are also used in many other genres. They are also used when session drummers are not available or if the production cannot afford {{the cost of a}} professional drummer. In the 2010s, most modern <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> are sequencers with a sample playback (rompler) or synthesizer component that specializes in the reproduction of drum timbres. Though features vary from model to model, many modern <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> can also produce unique sounds, and allow the user to compose unique drum beats and patterns.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} tool in music production for decades. However, its flawless way of playing drum patterns is often perceived as mechanical and rigid, far from the groove provided by a human drummer. This paper presents research towards enhancing the <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> with learning capabilities. The <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> learns user-specific variations (i. e. the groove) from human drummers, and stores the groove as attractors in Echo State Networks (ESNs). The ESNs are purely generative (i. e. not driven by an input signal) and the output is used by the <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> to imitate the playing style of human drummers, making it a cost-effective way of achieving life-like drums. ...|$|R
5000|$|Electro-mechanical <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> {{were first}} {{developed}} in 1949, with {{the invention of}} the Chamberlin Rhythmate.

Sly and the Family Stone's 1971 album There's a Riot Goin' On helped to popularize the sound of early <b>drum</b> <b>machines,</b> along with Timmy Thomas' 1972 R&B hit [...] "Why Can't We Live Together" [...] and George McCrae's 1974 disco hit [...] "Rock Your Baby" [...] which used early Roland rhythm machines.|$|R

In combining these elements, the sound of the <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> was first recorded on an individual track.
