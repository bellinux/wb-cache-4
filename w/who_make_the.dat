5|$|Netball {{plays an}} {{important}} role on the social life of Cook Island women. For their social activities, rather than go to bars, they play netball and go to church. Netball games are most often played on Saturdays during the winter months from April to August, though games can be played throughout the year. Female players <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> national team are treated like minor celebrities.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
25|$|In {{all classes}} and skill levels racers also {{receive the same}} number of points {{depending}} on how many are in their class and age group. These are called participant points. For instance if eight riders participate in 17-18 Intermediate class, all those <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> mains will get 8 points, including the last place finisher. If the class has 15 racers, all <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> main will get 15 points. So the winner of the Intermediate class will get 15 points for the fifteen racers in that class on top of the 50 points for winning for a total of 65 points.|$|E

25|$|Similarly {{to other}} public {{universities}} in Ukraine, students receive modest monthly scholarship payments from the government.

25|$|According to Governing, Cities and Localities section More commonly, central cities seek ways to tax nonresidents working {{downtown}} – {{known as}} commuter taxes – as property tax bases dwindle. Taken together, {{these two groups}} of taxpayers represent a largely untapped source of potential revenue that cities may begin to target more aggressively, particularly if they're struggling. According to struggling cities, this will help bring in a substantial revenue for the city {{which is a great}} way to tax the people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> most use of the highways and repairs.|$|E
25|$|This model, then, focuses {{mostly on}} “structural factors” {{of the mass}} media, {{including}} “ownership and control, dependence on other major funding sources (notably, advertisers), and mutual interests and relationships between the media and those <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> news and {{have the power to}} define it and explain what it means” (xi). Though the importance of this model and its influence on media studies is not to be denied, later thinkers have criticized this emphasis on structure over agency, because it neglects the ability of audiences of this media to question the prevailing notions represented.|$|E

Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or {{by one or more}} owners <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> rules.
