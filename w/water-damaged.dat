40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the enforcement of}} environmental protection laws under communism and democracy, while exploring the possibilities for cost-shifting between Czech enterprises and their employees as offered by labor contracts. Theory establishes the connection between cost-shifting possibilities and the efficient rule for enforcing water protection laws when the actions of enterprises and their employees combine to cause <b>water-damaging</b> accidents (for example, oil spills). For the years 1988 to 1991, analysis of labor arrangements in the Czech Republic discerns the apparently efficient rule for the communist and democratic periods, while statistical analysis discerns the operative enforcement rule in each period. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses principal-agent {{theory to}} examine the optimal mix of monetary- and resource-based {{penalties}} in two institutional settings: a market economy and a centrally planned economy. In a centrally planned economy, an agent's wealth depends mostly on real resources and little on monetary resources; therefore, monetary-based penalties have less penalizing power than do resource-based penalties. Based on this premise, theory generates hypotheses regarding differences in the optimal mix of penalty types between the two economic systems. This paper empirically tests these hypotheses {{using data from the}} Czech Republic regarding enforcement responses to <b>water-damaging</b> accidents (such as oil spills). © 2000 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

However, further assurance is required before sterigmatocystin can finally be dismissed as a risk because A. versicolor has been isolated frequently from cereals, grain products, fruits and marmalade, dried meat products and grapefruit juice. Relatively high levels of sterigmatocystin have been formed in bread, cured ham and salami after inoculation with A. versicolor.
