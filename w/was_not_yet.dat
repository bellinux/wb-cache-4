Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tipu Sultan, a Muslim enemy of the British in India.|$|E
5|$|Antestor (then called Crush Evil) existed {{prior to}} the release of Hellig Usvart but their music was a death/doom style, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> musically {{considered}} black metal. During the early 1990s when the band was known as Crush Evil, Euronymous, guitarist for the seminal black metal band Mayhem, was planning to stop Crush Evil from continuing. However, this never took place.|$|E

5|$|By July 2005, {{the band}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> signed {{to a record}} label. Howling Bells toured for ten {{months prior to the}} release of the album.

5|$|Construction of the line, {{supervised}} by Grainger & Miller, proved challenging, as a large-scale contracting industry <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> {{in place in}} Scotland; nor was large-scale financing. At the end of 1838 Miller was instructed to build a branch from Barassie to Troon Harbour, earlier thoughts of taking over the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway and converting it—as it was then still a horse-operated plateway—having been dropped.|$|E

He backed UK military action and intervention in Afghanistan and Libya respectively.|$|E
5|$|Fort Smith {{housed the}} civil service working in the Territories officially until 1967.

5|$|Fulfordgate {{was located}} in the {{south-east}} of York, {{away from the city}} centre.

During the ground's existence, bus routes had not been fully developed and car ownership <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> become common; it was not easy for the majority of supporters to reach.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the first}} {{published}} {{information on the}} cultivation of Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961.
