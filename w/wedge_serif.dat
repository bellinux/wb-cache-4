5000|$|Icone (1980): a <b>wedge</b> <b>serif</b> design. Almost monoline, {{but with}} a gentle flare of strokes.|$|E
50|$|The Bohemians logo was {{originally}} designed by graphic designer Martin Venezky and later refined by typographer Jim Parkinson. It {{was based on}} the 19th Century <b>wedge</b> <b>serif</b> typeface Saracen as redrawn by Jonathan Hoefler.|$|E
5000|$|One of Carter's {{more unusual}} {{projects}} was a font, Van Lanen, for the Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum. A 'Latin'-style <b>wedge</b> <b>serif</b> font, {{it was released}} both in digital form and wood type. In an article on it, Carter noted {{that it has been}} [...] "50 years since a type of my design had been in a physical form that I could hold in my hand." ...|$|E
5000|$|Frutiger's 1984 {{typeface}} Versailles is an old-style serif {{text with}} capitals {{like those in}} the earlier [...] Versailles is a Latin design with sharp <b>wedge</b> <b>serifs,</b> based on a popular genre in 19th-century printing.|$|R
5000|$|Adrian Frutiger's first {{commercial}} typeface was [...] — {{a set of}} titling capital letters with small, bracketed serifs, released in 1954. A calligraphic, informal, script face, [...] ("wave" [...] in French), also was released in 1954. In 1955, , a glyphic, old-style, serif text face was released. The typeface shows inspiration by Nicolas Jenson, and, in the [...] type, Frutiger's ideas of letter construction, unity, and organic form, are first expressed together. Raph Levien described as a [...] "Frutiger trademark" [...] his common use of an [...] "a" [...] where the loop makes a horizontal line at the top on meeting the vertical. It makes use of narrow <b>wedge</b> <b>serifs,</b> a style sometimes known as Latin which Frutiger would often use in his future serif designs. In 1956, he designed his first-of-three, slab-serif typefaces — Egyptienne, on the Clarendon model; after Univers, it was the second, new text face to be commissioned for photo-composition.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, TV Land aired special program blocks on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day (beginning on December 31, 2001): {{the final day}} of the year {{revolved}} around series finales of classic television series, and the first day of the new year exclusively featured pilot episodes. On January 1, 2001, the network introduced a streamlined logo, which traded the uneven-ness of the original design for a more rigid form, and restricted the <b>wedge</b> <b>serif</b> type to the [...] "TV" [...] and the sans serif type to the [...] "LAND" [...] in the logo. TV Land celebrated its 10th anniversary on April 29, 2006. On December 17, 2006, MTV Networks (which was renamed Viacom Media Networks in 2011) began operating TV Land as part of its Kids & Family Group unit, with Nickelodeon taking over operational duties for Nick at Nite, which in turn had previously maintained oversight of TV Land since its launch.|$|E
40|$|The Lindisfarne Gospels {{produced}} {{at the end}} of the 7 th century in England are famous for the initials on the opening pages with its splendid illumination but this study deals with the actual text of the gospels. The main text is plain in comparison to the initials but the different and special shape of the continental text characters is an important element of these gospels. It is called Insular Half Uncial script, an alteration of the Half Uncial script used by the Roman Catholic Church, influenced by the culture of Ireland and Great Britain. The biggest feature of this script is <b>wedge</b> <b>serif.</b> However, this is not simply a design issue;it also has the function of mutually joining the characters. This is different from the natural joining of characters in cursive writing and, despite it being in formal hand, characters were consciously joined. A number of other ways of joining characters apart from serif can be observed. Of course, the main objective of joining characters is the unique impression of the text that this creates. However,joined-up writing is difficult to read, sometimes it makes vision blurry and it can cause the uniform rhythm of reading to break down. The per cola et commata style is basically easy to read, readers are not particularly conscious of the text and it is easy to concentrate on the contents of the text but, in reality, there are some parts that are difficult to read and that cause the vision to blur. When you come across these passages,it becomes easy for the consciousness to look at the characters themselves. Under the geographical conditions of the north,in contrast to the fact that people had no choice but to use texts received from the Roman Catholic Church as they were,it is possible to differentiate with continental Roman Catholic Church characters in script design. Difficulty of reading and innovations that blur vision were a device to draw the consciousness of readers directly to characters that they would not normally notice and sometimes impede this...|$|E
