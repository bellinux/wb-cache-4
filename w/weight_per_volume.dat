50|$|Although {{freeze-drying}} is used {{to preserve}} food, its earliest use in agriculturally based industries was in processing of crops such as peanuts/groundnuts and tobacco in the early 1970s. Because heat, commonly used in crop and food processing, invariably alters the structure and chemistry of the product, the main objective of freeze-drying is to avoid heat and thus preserve the structural and chemical integrity/composition {{with little or no}} alteration. Therefore, freeze-dried crops and foods are closest to the natural composition with respect to structure and chemistry. The process came to wide public attention when it was used to create freeze-dried ice cream, an example of astronaut food. It is also widely used to produce essences or flavourings to add to food. Because of its light <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>volume</b> of reconstituted food, freeze-dried products are popular and convenient for hikers. More dried food can be carried per the same weight of wet food, and remains in good condition for longer than wet food, which tends to spoil quickly.

Analysis of wipe samples indicated that most surfaces in the pharmacy compounding area and inpatient and outpatient wards were contaminated with 5 -FU.

Five different decontaminant agents were tested and only one (a 0. 5 % <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>volume</b> sodium hypochlorite solution) was found to be effective as a cleaning agent that rapidly breaks down 5 -FU and also kills bacteria.

Different types of 50  mM buffers (containing 0. 2 % glutamic acid) consisting of Tris, citric acid, boric acid and phosphate buffer (pH 5. 6) were used to stabilize the pH of the reaction system.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of three diets (alcohol, pair-fed, or chow) for 18 months. The rats were sacrificed 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months after feeding was initiated.

Using a spectrophotometer, calcium as percent ash and milligrams per gram, and percent mineral were calculated. A decrease in longitudinal growth, in the alcohol-fed animals, was found in the early weeks of the experiment with a trend of values merging to normal as the animals aged. Similar data were observed in wet weight, dry weight, fat-free weight, and ash weight. Examination of ash <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> unit <b>volume</b> and percent ash, which should be essentially mineral, reveal data contradictory to that initially observed. There is not a merging period in which alcohol-treated animals reach the same mineral content as non-treated animals. At each measurement femur density is significantly less in alcohol-treated animals than in untreated animals, supporting reports of alcohol effects on bone mass that have been repeatedly confirmed. The mechanism behind the effect alcohol has on bone continues to remain unclear. There is substantial evidence to support the idea that alcohol consumption at an early age seems to slow the rate of growth and that chronic use of alcohol prevents optimal bone growth...|$|R
