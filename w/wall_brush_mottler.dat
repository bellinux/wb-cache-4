60|$|The sudden {{appearance}} {{of one of}} the king's own bodyguard had a magic effect upon the brawlers. Dalbert sprang back, with his thumb still in his mouth, and his sword drooping, scowling darkly at the new-comer. His long sallow face was distorted with anger, and his small black eyes blazed with passion and with the hell-fire light of unsatisfied vengeance. His troopers had released their victim, and stood panting in a line, while the young man leaned against the <b>wall,</b> <b>brushing</b> the dust from his black coat, and looking from his rescuer to his antagonists.|$|R

5000|$|The game {{provides}} a navigational wire frame map that displays any {{area of the}} mine visited or seen by the player, which revolves around the players position. Use of the slide controls (commonly the joystick [...] "Hat" [...] switch) allows the player to navigate to areas of the map away from their current location. The use of wire-frame models meant that areas at varying distances would appear to mix together when overlapping. This was overcome in Descent 3 {{with the use of}} opaque <b>wall</b> <b>brushes</b> and lighting closely matching that found in-game. Additionally, Descent 3s map system allowed the player the ability to move the viewpoint through the tunnels in map mode.|$|R

The maximum height was 1.4 meters (4.7 feet), water could be 4 meters (7.3 feet) max in width. The course also included a ditch, stone <b>wall,</b> post-and-rail, <b>brush,</b> and triple-bars, and was ridden at a speed of 400 mpm.|$|R

60|$|In the parlour {{window of}} this little habitation, which is so close upon the footway that the {{passenger}} who takes the <b>wall</b> <b>brushes</b> the dim glass with his coat sleeve--much to its improvement, for it is very dirty--in this parlour window {{in the days of}} its occupation by Sampson Brass, there hung, all awry and slack, and discoloured by the sun, a curtain of faded green, so threadbare from long service as by no means to intercept the view of the little dark room, but rather to afford a favourable medium through which to observe it accurately. There was not much to look at. A rickety table, with spare bundles of papers, yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket, ostentatiously displayed upon its top; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture; a treacherous old chair by the fire-place, whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and helped to squeeze him dry; a second-hand wig box, used as a depository for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law, once the sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to the box, as they were now of the box itself; two or three common books of practice; a jar of ink, a pounce box, a stunted hearth-broom, a carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of desperation to its tacks--these, with the yellow wainscot of the walls, the smoke-discoloured ceiling, the dust and cobwebs, were among the most prominent decorations of the office of Mr Sampson Brass.|$|R

All of his fine, free, unconscious grace was gone and his strength of limb only added to his awkwardness.|$|R
5000|$|Central vacuums can be {{equipped}} with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or turbine) systems frequently are less expensive because they don’t require electrical wires for power to be run to each <b>wall</b> inlet. Turbine-driven <b>brushes</b> tend to be noisier than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable {{in the absence of}} the [...] "vacuum whine" [...] produced by portable vacuums. Many users find that the high suction of central vacuums is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.|$|R

Bright also {{received}} a drive through penalty as well, again for contact in the pitlane, an 'unsafe release'. That handed the lead back to James Courtney with Michael Caruso pressing hard. An accident for Mark McNally triggered the fourth safety car period, with the race restarting on lap 54 with Courtney leading Caruso, Winterbottom, Ingall and Fabian Coulthard. Cameron McConville, Jason Bright and Craig Lowndes (sucked into Bright's accident) all <b>brushed</b> <b>walls</b> on the restart lap. Lowndes and McConville retired. Todd Kelly began dropping down field with battery or alternator problems.|$|R
5000|$|Various [...] "machines" [...] are the {{subjects}} of Horn's work in the 1980s. Among others, she created a machine to mimic the human act of painting in The Little Painting School Performs a Waterfall (1988). Thirteen feet above the floor on a gallery wall, three fan-shaped paint brushes mounted on flexible metal arms slowly flutter down into cups filled with blue and green acrylic paint. After {{a few seconds of}} immersion they snap backward, spattering paint onto the wall, the ceiling, the floor, and onto canvases projected from the <b>wall</b> below. The <b>brushes</b> immediately resume their descent, and the cycle is repeated until each canvas is covered in paint.|$|R
60|$|At {{the back}} of a native hut the spoor led through a small hole {{recently}} cut in the <b>brush</b> <b>wall</b> and into the dark interior beyond. Fearlessly, Tarzan followed the trail. On hands and knees, he crawled through the small aperture. Within the hut his nostrils were assailed by many odors; but clear and distinct among them was one that half aroused a latent memory of the past--it was the faint and delicate odor of a woman. With the cognizance of it there rose in the breast of the ape-man a strange uneasiness--the result of an irresistible force which he was destined to become acquainted with anew--the instinct which draws the male to his mate.|$|R
30|$|People {{and their}} {{livestock}} affect {{the cover and}} density of woody plants (both trees and shrubs) {{in a variety of}} ways. Pastoralists cut woody stems for a number of purposes: as fuel for domestic fires or, more recently, to make charcoal for sale in urban areas, as <b>brush</b> <b>walls</b> for bomas, for construction of houses, and for medicinal purposes. This harvesting of woody vegetation can reduce the density and cover of trees and shrubs, particularly in areas where people are partly or fully sedentary. Pastoralists’ browsing livestock (e.g., goats, camels) can also {{have a negative impact on}} woody plants, ultimately reducing their numbers. Finally, as discussed above, fire can reduce woody cover and density (Okello et al. 2008).|$|R
5000|$|The {{site of the}} Presidio {{was chosen}} by Felipe de Neve, the fourth {{governor}} of Las Californias. Perceiving that the coast at Santa Barbara was vulnerable to attack, he located a spot near a harbor which was sheltered from severe storms. In addition, there was an ample supply of both building materials and water nearby. [...] Construction began on April 21, 1782, and Padre Junípero Serra blessed the site. [...] By the next year, a temporary facility had been completed, and a wheat field planted by the local Chumash Indians of Chief Yanonalit. The early Presidio consisted of mud and <b>brush</b> <b>walls</b> around a quadrangle 330 feet on a side. The post had 61 officers and men in 1783.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not easy}} to hold that pace among the graves, and at another time he might have gone more slowly, or round by the path. Unmindful of all obstacles, however, he pressed forward without {{slackening}} his speed, and soon arrived within a few yards of the window. He approached as softly as he could, and advancing so near the <b>wall</b> as to <b>brush</b> the whitened ivy with his dress, listened. There was no sound inside. The church itself was not more quiet. Touching the glass with his cheek, he listened again. No. And yet there was such a silence all around, that he felt sure he could have heard even the breathing of a sleeper, if there had been one there.|$|R
30|$|Five J 20 {{individuals}} (body weight 0.39  ±  0.03  g) {{were released}} in each tank, creating a density of about 20 individuals per m 2. Commercial pelleted feed (vital prawn) was fed three times daily in each tank. Feeding quantity was recorded every time for each tank; quantity was adjusted {{according to the}} appetite of the juveniles, which was shown as feed remaining {{on the bottom of}} the tank. Excreta and remaining shrimp feed were removed from the tanks every morning. Chaetomorpha sp. was maintained to cover about 30 – 50  % of the water surface or bottom of the co-culture tanks. Seaweed was freely grazed by shrimp in co-culture tanks. Any seaweed, including diatoms, growing in the monoculture tanks (controls) was inhibited and scraped off from the <b>walls</b> with a <b>brush</b> every week.|$|R
50|$|Most {{information}} about the Nicoleño comes through Juana Maria. When Nidever located her, {{she was living in}} a round brush enclosure, about 6 ft in diameter and 5 ft high, with a narrow opening on one side. She cooked her food over a fire inside her home. Several similar enclosures were still standing at the time, and another type of structure, made of <b>brush</b> <b>walls</b> supported by whale ribs, was also found. Juana Maria hung seal meat from a series of 4 - 8 ft long poles placed around the structures, or from ropes stretched between the poles. Like other California natives, the Nicoleño were apparently skilled basket weavers, and Juana Maria is described as making four different shapes. When found she was wearing a dress made of green cormorant skins, decorated with feathers. She had a number of possessions made of sinew and bone.|$|R
40|$|A microreactor {{platform}} {{has been}} realized as an enabling tool to perform synthetic organic reactions. The platform provides advantages over batch reactions, thus allowing: reactions with a potentially explosive reagent, {{the execution of}} heterogeneous catalysis by immobilizing catalysts onto {{the interior of a}} microchannel surface, and the performance of controlled formation of supramolecular nanoparticle clusters. In the first part, the regioselective ring opening of various types of aromatic and aliphatic epoxides with hazardous sodium azide to give vicinal azido alcohols, was studied in a microreactor with and without pillars in the channels. The reactions performed in microreactors with pillars displayed better conversions compared to analogous lab scale reactions. In the second part, polymer brush layers with thicknesses of a few hundred nanometers were used as a support for catalyst immobilization on the interior of microchannel <b>walls.</b> Polymer <b>brushes</b> support higher catalyst loadings as compared to monolayers. Different types of catalysts were implemented inside the microreactor. Their catalytic efficiency was studied for different reactions. In the last part, self-assembly of supramolecular nanoparticle clusters (SNPCs) has been demonstrated in a microfluidic device, by controlling the diffusive mixing of the constituting supramolecular building blocks. Microreactors are a valuable tool to study homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions in a safe and efficient way. Polymer brushes have proven to be a robust platform to immobilize various catalysts on the interior of a microchannel for performing supported catalysis. In addition, microreactors provide a unique environment for the controlled fabrication of nanomaterials compared to lab-scale equipment. So, microreactors have the potential to become a common experimental device for chemists in various disciplines...|$|R
5000|$|The field hunter's primary {{requirements}} {{have more}} to do with ability than with looks; therefore he may be any type of horse or pony which can get the job done, safely and competently for his rider. They must be able to keep up with the field, negotiate any type of terrain or footing competently, and be agile and competent white doing it. He is expected to [...] "stand" [...] at [...] "check," [...] (while hounds are working) or for his rider to re-mount him when necessary, never to kick a hound or another horse, and to be under complete control at all times. He should be steady, tough and robust, and able to withstand the inevitable knocks, bumps, bruises, minor injuries, and sometimes falls which happen in the hunt field. Field hunters must have the ability of [...] "staying sane" [...] at all times in the high excitement in a crush of galloping horses, and he should have brakes whenever he is called on, to stop quickly. It also helps if he happens to be good-natured, and enjoys his job. He needs a good sound foot, strong legs, and an amenable brain. Riding safely at speed, the ability to stay under control, and attitude all play a vital role for the field hunter. The type of fences he could encounter in the field run from low stone <b>walls</b> to <b>brush,</b> to coops in fence lines to rail fences, logs, railroad timber obstacles, and other [...] "natural boundaries" [...] found in hunting territories.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the expression and activities of lysosomal enzymes that act upon proteins and sulfated polysaccharides in diabetic rat kidney. Cathepsins, glycosidases and sulfatases were studied on the 10 th (DM- 10) and on the 30 th (DM- 30) day of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM). The activity of cathepsin B, the main kidney cysteine protease, was decreased both in DM- 10 and DM- 30. Gel filtration chromatography of urinary proteins has shown the prevalence of low molecular weight peptides in normal and DM- 10 urine, in contrast to the prevalence of high molecular weight peptides and intact proteins in DM- 30. These results show that the decrease in lysosomal proteases could explain, at least in part, the increased albuminuria detected by radial immunodiffusion (RID), due to the excretion of less degraded or intact albumin. Concerning sulfated polysaccharides, the activities of β-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, and N-acetyl-β-d-galactosaminidase were also decreased in DM- 30, while aryl sulfatases did not vary. Increased toluidine blue metachromatic staining of the tissue suggests that the lower activities of glycosidases could lead to intracellular deposition of partially digested molecules, and this could explain the decreased urinary excretion and increased tissue buildup of these molecules. The main morphological changes observed in kidney were proximal convoluted tubules with thinner <b>walls</b> and thinner <b>brush</b> border. Immunohistochemistry revealed that most of cathepsin B was located in the brush border of proximal tubular cells, highlighting the involvement of proximal convoluted tubules in diabetic nephropathy...|$|R
50|$|The Red Palace and Red Square {{used to be}} an old-style {{school during}} the Ming Dynasty. In 1927, between November 18 and 21, the Haifeng Soviet Congress of Worker-Peasant-Soldiers was held there. During this {{congress}}, the Haifeng Soviet Government was established. The congress also decided to <b>brush</b> <b>walls</b> around the palace with red paint and cover the indoor walls with red cloth, imitating the Red Palace in Moscow, Russia. Hence, the first Red regime was established. They also gave this old-style school a new name—Red Palace. After that, many important meetings were held in the Red Palace and the square to the east of it was named the Red Square. It was called “Dongcang Bu” (东仓埔) before that and covered an area of more than 22 square kilometers. After the establishment of the Chinese soviet regime, Peng Pai, the leader of the regime proposed the construction of a gate for the Red Square and a Platform for speeches. Then the gate and the platform were built. There is a golden five-pointed star and two Chinese characters—红场 (Red Square) embossed {{at the top of the}} gate and a couplet at both sides of the gate inscribed with “铲除封建势力，实行土地革命” (Wipe out the feudal forces, Carry out Agrarian Revolution). At the center of the square, a speech transmission station was set up for the convenience of rallies. On December 1, 1927, a rally with over 50,000 participants was held to celebrate the establishment of Haifeng Soviet Government. On Jan. 1st 1928, troops from Nanchang City after Nanchang Uprising led by Dong Lang (董朗) Yan Changxi (颜昌熙) met troops from Guangzhou City after Guangzhou Uprising in the square and successfully joined together. In 1986, the bronze statue of Peng Pai was set in the Red Square 57 years after his sacrifice for revolution.|$|R

5000|$|What I {{liked to}} do for fun when I was a child was to gather up sacks of stones and pile them on a table near the window high and free. When I reached middle age, I felt ashamed of doing this and so I stopped, {{becoming}} like any other ordinary person, obtuse like a brick. Finally, I have reached decrepit old age, and I particularly dislike the sound of children’s games in the summer. So I had the children gather up stones {{in the corner of}} the <b>wall.</b> I <b>brushed</b> them off and washed them, preparing a green celadon tray with white sand on the bottom. The result was poetry that would lighten your heart. The landscape lent a coolness to the air and dispelled the heart. A visitor saw it and exclaimed, “Okay, okay, but it seems a little bald, doesn’t it?”I responded, “You see a pile of stones and fail to see the mountains. The marvelous thing about miniature landscape gardens is that they are imitations of mountains and streams. The base is made to look flowing waves and the cliffs are made to seem covered with vegetation. Sometimes you can see miniature gnarled pine or knobby plum. You might see unusual blossoms or strange new shoots from their trimmed branches. Of course you will discover the utter vexation of your creations withering and wilting due to carelessness of slow watering and tending. If you fail to exert yourself, then you will simply fail to fashion a magnificent mountain and a smaller world among the smaller mounds and hills. [...] “Years ago I climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji. The climb took three days. For two days I passed through areas of great trees and forests, but on the third morning there wasn’t a blade of grass to be seen! At that point there were only great boulder-like cliffs and purplish-red stones. It was like this for a number of miles until I reached the peak itself. Of course Mt. Fuji is not unique in this respect as all peaks are without vegetation. People who climb mountains do not dislike the so-called baldness; rather, the love the sense of height. “These stones then, just a number of inches tall, and this tray roughly a foot across, they are nothing short of a mountainous island rising from the sea! Jade-green peaks penetrate the clouds and are encircled by them. A blue-green barrier, immersed in water, is standing straight up. There are caves as if carved in the cliff sides to hide saints and immortals. Jetties and spits flat enough and long enough for fishermen. The paths and roads are narrow and confined, yet woodcutters can pass along them. There are lagoons deep and dark enough to hide dragons. “So is it not fitting that I guard against weeds, carefully watching and laboring over the thing, taking delight in its total subtlety? Do you dislike the baldness of the small mounds and hills? Am I oblivious to the bareness of just the peak? I sometimes pick a flowering branch and place it in a peak or in a ravine. The alternations of plant life, their blooming in the morning and fading in the evening, are the splendor of the four seasons with their countless transformations and myriad changes! So therefore I say that it doesn’t have to be bare, and it does not have to be lush.“Another thing, do you think this miniature landscape is big? Do you think it is small? I will blow on the water and raise up billows from the four seas. I will water the peak and send down a torrent from the ninth heaven! The person who waters the stones sets the cosmos in order. The one who changes the water turns the whole sea upside down. Those are the changes in nature which attain a oneness in my mind. Anyway, the relative size of things is an uncertain business. Why, there is a vast plain on a fly’s eyelash and whole nations in a snail’s horn, a Chinese philosopher has told us. Well what do you think?”My visitor got up from his seat and made his excuses. He saw that these stones purified my senses and purified my intellect. He realized that events are really not what they seemed and yet they enriched me. I told him that he only understood what he perceived with his own eyes and did not understand my point of view at all. I asked if he wouldn’t like to sit for a while longer and study the matter afresh. He said he would, but there were no waves for him. He said nothing more and I was silent. After a while my visitor left without another word. Saihokushu, ch. 1, pp. 1-2.|$|R
