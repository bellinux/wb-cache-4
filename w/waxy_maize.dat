50|$|During World War II, {{when the}} Japanese severed the supply {{lines of the}} States, {{processors}} were forced to turn to <b>waxy</b> <b>maize.</b> <b>Waxy</b> <b>maize</b> appeared to be especially suitable for this purpose because it could be milled with the same equipment already extensively used for ordinary maize. H. H. Schopmeyer has advised that the production of <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> in Iowa for industrial use amounted to approximately 356 metric tons in 1942 and 2540 tons in 1943. In 1944, there were only 5 varieties of <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> available for waxy starch production. In 1943, {{to cover all the}} special requirements for amylopectin, approximately 81650 tons of grains were produced. From World War II until 1971, all the <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> produced in the U.S. was grown under contract for food or industrial processors. In fact, most of the maize was grown in only a few counties in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana.|$|E
50|$|Starch from <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> {{differs from}} regular maize starch in both {{molecular}} structure and pasting characteristics. Pastes made from waxy starch {{are long and}} cohesive, whereas pastes made from regular maize starch are short and heavy bodied. <b>Waxy</b> <b>maize</b> starch is a major starch component in adhesives used for making bottle labels. This waxy starch-based adhesive imparts resolubilizing resistance to the labels which prevents their soaking off the bottle if immersed in water or being subjected to very high humidity conditions. Moreover, <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> starches are commonly used in the US for the manufacture of gummed tapes and envelope adhesives.|$|E
40|$|The waxy gene, {{which is}} {{responsible}} for the synthesis of amylose in endosperm and pollen, is genetically well characterized in many grasses including maize and rice. Homology between the previously cloned <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> gene and the rice gene has facilitated our cloning of a 15 -kb HindIII fragment that contains the entire rice gene. A comparison of the restriction maps of the maize and rice genes indicates that many restriction sites within translated exons are conserved. In addition, the rice gene encodes a 2. 4 -kb transcript that programs the in vitro synthesis of a 64 -kD pre-protein which is efficiently precipitated with <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> antisera. We demonstrate that these gene products are altered in rice strains containing mutant waxy genes. Southern blot analysis of 16 rice strains, ten containing waxy mutations, reveals that the waxy gene and flanking restriction fragments are virtually identical. These results contrast dramatically with the high level of insertions and deletions associated with restriction fragment length polymorphism and spontaneous mutations among the <b>waxy</b> alleles of <b>maize...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{striking}} {{example of}} genetic drift in maize is the occurrence {{in parts of}} Asia of varieties with <b>waxy</b> endosperm.

In native state, it does not display all the required properties as the resistance to thermomechanical treatment and storage stability.

The most investigated modifications methods are the ones based on annealing (Jacobs et al., 1998) and heat-moisture treatments (Gunaratne and Hoover, 2002). The purpose of the present work was to use a recent hydrothermal process, the Instantaneous Controlled Pressure Drop (DIC) and to determine the effect of DIC conditions on the structural properties of standard (SMS) and <b>waxy</b> (WMS) <b>maize</b> starches.

50|$|Researchers have {{identified}} the Granule Bound Starch Synthase (GBSS) as the enzyme that specifically elongates amylose during starch biosynthesis in plants. The <b>waxy</b> locus in <b>maize</b> encodes for the GBSS protein. Mutants lacking the GBSS protein produce starch containing only amylopectin, such as in waxy corn. In Arabidopsis leaves, another gene, encoding the Protein Targeting to STarch (PTST) protein, is required in addition to GBSS for amylose synthesis. Mutants lacking either protein produce starch without amylose. GM potato cultivar Amflora by BASF Plant Science was developed to not produce amylose.|$|R

In order to improve the texture and acceptance of cookies, five different experimental treatments were devised and compared with a cookie made with refined wheat flour. A <b>waxy</b> native <b>maize</b> or pregelatinized cross-linked starches in concentrations of 5 % and 10 % were evaluated. Results showed that the spread factor, diameter, and thickness of {{the different types of}} cookies were not statistically different (p> 0. 05). With the exception of the control and cookies made with 10 % waxy starch which were rated with lower scores, the rest of the treatments were not significantly different in terms of sensory attributes. The texture of cookies evaluated by panelists related to the objective texture was determined with the texture analyzer. Cookies made from the composite flour containing 10 % pregelatinized cross-linked were softer or had lower maximum positive force after 5 days of storage. This particular gluten-free cookie contained 65 % more dietary fiber compared to the wheat flour counterpart and had the best sensory attributes among all treatments including the cookie made with refined wheat flour...|$|R
40|$|The wx-K {{mutation}} {{results from}} the insertion of a copia-like retrotransposon into exon 12 of the <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> gene. This retrotransposon, named Hopscotch, has one long open reading frame encoding all of the domains required for transposition. Computer-assisted database searches using Hopscotch and other plant copia-like retroelements as query sequences have revealed that ancient, degenerate retrotransposon insertions are found {{in close proximity to}} 21 previously sequenced plant genes. The data suggest that these elements may be involved in gene duplication and the regulation of gene expression. Similar searches using the Drosophila retrotransposon copia did not reveal any retrotransposon-like sequences in the flanking regions of animal genes. These results, together with the recent finding that reverse-transcriptase sequences characteristic of copia-like elements are ubiquitous and diverse in plants, suggest that copia-like retrotransposons are an ancient component of plant genomes...|$|R
50|$|In 1922, another researcher, P. Weatherwax of Indiana University in Bloomington, {{reported}} that the starch in <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> was entirely of a “rare” form called “erythrodextrin”, known today as amylopectin. He found that this rare starch stained red with iodine, in contrast to normal starch which stained blue. Bates, French et al. and Sprague, Brimhall, et al. confirmed that endosperm starch of <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> consists nearly exclusively of amylopectin. The presence of amylopectin in rice had been demonstrated previously by Parnell.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} in feeding of <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> {{began in the}} 1940s.

Increases of both milk production and butterfat content for lactating dairy cattle, increase in daily weight gains in fattening lambs and when fed to finishing beef cattle.|$|E
5000|$|And when Collins found such a {{distinct}} {{difference in the}} appearance of normal and <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> endosperm, he suspected a difference in chemical composition, but the analysis did not yield any unusual results. The percentages of starch, oil, and protein were all within the normal range. Yet, he was intrigued by the physical nature of the starch, and wrote: “In view of the recent development of specialised maize products as human food, the unique type of starch may be of some economic importance." [...] So actually, for many years the main use of <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> was a genetic marker for other maize breeding programs. Breeders {{were able to use}} some of the traits to “tag” the existence of hidden genes and follow them through breeding programs. It is possible that <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> would have become extinct again in the USA without this special application in breeding.|$|E
40|$|During fine {{structure}} analyses of artificially induced <b>waxy</b> mutants in <b>maize</b> {{by use of}} Nelson's pollen analysis methods, it was noticed that some mutants showed a phenotype intermediate between waxy and normal nonwaxy. Such intermediate or leaky waxy mutants were frequent among mutants induced by a chemical mutagen, EMS. They seemed to be located evenly within the waxy locus. This would suggest {{that they might have}} been missense mutations, which would produce full-sized but partially inactivated enzymes, rather than deletions or frameshift mutations. To confirm the intermediate phenotype, a rapid measuring system was developed to measure waxyness of endosperm quantitatively. It was based on the blue value method and is applicable to a single grain of rice. Among the 27 waxy mutant lines of maize, including 11 EMS-induced, two of the EMS-induced mutants were clearly intermediate. Eighteen EMS induced wx mutants of rice were also examined, and nine were intermediate...|$|R
40|$|The wx-B 2 {{mutation}} {{results from}} a 128 -bp transposable element-like insertion in exon 11 of the <b>maize</b> <b>Waxy</b> gene. Surprisingly, 11 maize genes and one barley gene in the GenBank and EMBL data bases were found to contain similar elements in flanking or intron sequences. Members of this previously undescribed family of elements, designated Tourist, are short (133 bp on average), have conserved terminal inverted repeats, are flanked by a 3 -bp direct repeat, and display target site specificity. Based on estimates of repetitiveness of three Tourist elements in maize genomic DNA, the copy number of the Tourist element family may exceed that of all previously reported eukaryotic inverted repeat elements. Taken together, our data suggest that Tourist may be the maize equivalent of the human Alu family of elements with respect to copy number, genomic dispersion, and the high frequency of association with genes...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis for the}} low level expression of three alleles of the <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> (Wx) gene has been described. Each allele contains a retrotransposon in intron sequences. These insertions represent previously undescribed elements, and their association with three wx alleles indicates that retrotransposon elements are important agents of spontaneous mutation in maize. For each allele, element sequences are spliced from pre-mRNA with the surrounding intron even though the insertions increase intron length by approximately 40 - to 60 -fold. In addition, despite differences in element sequences, insertion sites, and relative orientations, each element disrupts long-range splice site recognition leading to novel Wx transcripts where exons both upstream and downstream of the insertion site are skipped. The expression of wx alleles with large insertions in introns provides support for studies that indicate that the primary cis requirement for maize introns is the splice donor and acceptor sites...|$|R
5000|$|Modified <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> {{starches}} {{are used}} {{for the improvement of}} uniformity, stability, and texture in various food products.

It improves smoothness and creaminess of canned food and dairy products as well as freeze-thaw stability of frozen foods. It gives a more desirable texture and appearance to dry foods and mixes 24. <b>Waxy</b> <b>maize</b> starch is also the preferred starting material for the production of maltodextrins because of improved water solubility after drying and greater solution stability and clarity.|$|E

5000|$|For <b>waxy</b> <b>maize,</b> {{a single}} {{recessive}} gene (wx) was {{located on the}} short arm of chromosome 9, codes for the waxy endosperm of the kernel (Wx codes for endosperm with normal starch). This was first shown by Collins and Kempton.|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that three alleles of the <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> (wx) gene were alternatively spliced {{as a result}} of the insertion of retrotransposons into intronic sequences. In addition, inefficient splicing of element sequences with the surrounding intron produced wild-type transcripts that presumably were responsible for the observed residual gene expression in the endosperm. In this study, we report that one of these alleles, wxG, has a tissue-specific phenotype with 30 -fold more WX enzymatic activity in pollen than in the endosperm. Quantification of wxG-encoded transcripts in pollen and the endosperm demonstrates that this difference can be accounted for by tissue-specific differences in RNA processing. Specifically, there is approximately 30 -fold more correctly spliced RNA in pollen than in the endosperm. Based on an analogy to similar examples of tissue-specific alternative splicing in animal systems, we hypothesize that the tissue-specific phenotype of the wxG allele may reflect differences in the concentration of splicing factors in these tissues...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum and <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> {{starches}} were hydrophobically modified with octenylsuccinic anhydride (OSA) {{and treated}} with enzymes before {{being used to}} emulsify β-carotene (beta,beta-carotene) and oil in water. Enzyme treatment with β-amylase resulted in emulsions that were broken (separated) earlier and suffered increased degradation of β-carotene, whereas treatment with pullulanase {{had little effect on}} emulsions. Combinations of surfactants with high and low hydrodynamic volume (V) indicated that there is a relationship between V and emulsion stability. Degree of branching (DB) had little direct influence on emulsions, though surfactants with the highest DB were poor emulsifiers due to their reduced molecular size. Results indicate that V and branch length (including linear components) are the primary influences on octenylsuccinylated starches forming stable emulsions, due to the increased steric hindrance from short amphiphilic branches, consistent with current understanding of electrosteric stabilization. The success of OSA-modified sorghum starch points to possible new products of interest in arid climates...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the structure of}} five spontaneous deletions within the <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> (Wx) gene. Of these, four were found in spontaneous wx mutants (wx-B, wx-B 1, wx-B 6, wx-C 4) and include exon sequences; the fifth is restricted to an intron and represents a {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} of a nonmutant allele (Wx-W 23). The deletions, which range in size from 60 to 980 base pairs (bp), cluster in a G+C-rich region of approximately 1000 bp that is capable of forming stable secondary structures. Most striking is our finding that all of the alleles have DNA insertions (filler DNA) of 1 - 131 bp between the deletion endpoints. For three of the five deletions, the filler DNA and sequences at the deletion termini appear to be derived from sequences near one deletion endpoint. A previously reported spontaneous deletion of the maize bronze gene (bz-R) also contains filler DNA. The association of filler DNA with maize deletion endpoints contrasts dramatically with the rarity of similar events in animal germ-line and bacterial mutations...|$|R

Until World War II, the main source of starch in the USA was tapioca but when Japan severed the supply lines of the States, they forced processors to turn to <b>waxy</b> <b>maize.</b> Amylopectin or waxy starch is now used mainly in food products, but also in the textile, adhesive, corrugating and paper industry.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cultivated}} plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose, known as waxy starches.

High amylose starch, amylomaize, is cultivated {{for the use of}} its gel strength and for use as a resistant starch (a starch that resists digestion) in food products.|$|E
50|$|Due to the waxy gene being recessive, <b>waxy</b> <b>maize</b> {{has to be}} {{isolated}} from any nearby dent maize fields by at least 200 meters to prevent cross-pollination.

40|$|A {{mutation}} at the <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> locus, wx 1240, {{was isolated}} following treatment of pollen with EMS and self-pollinating ears on M 1 plants. This allele was cloned {{and found to}} contain a 30 -bp deletion within the gene and additional lesions upstream of the transcription start site. Using fine structure genetic mapping, we determined that the deletion {{is responsible for the}} mutant phenotype. In addition, the position of wx 1240 on the genetic map coincided with the previously determined positions of two other waxy mutations, the spontaneous wx-C, which is reference allele, and the putative ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) -induced wx-BL 2. Molecular analysis of these alleles revealed that both contain the same deletion as wx 1240, and that the wx-BL 2 allele is similar to wx-C and possibly resulted from wx-C contamination. The deleted sequence responsible for these mutations is flanked by a short, 4 -bp, direct repeat. Similar structures are favored sites for spontaneous deletions in other organisms. The data suggests that EMS is capable of inducing structural alterations in plant genes in addition to the point mutations normally ascribed to EMS-induced mutations...|$|R
40|$|Soluble ADPglucose-α-glucan 4 -α-glucosyltransferase (starch synthetase), ADPglucose pyro{{phosphorylase}}, UDPglucose pyrophosphorylase and phosphorylase were assayed in {{extracts from}} developing kernels of maize (Zea mays).

Thus all starch could be synthesized via the ADPglucose pathway. High levels of UDPglucose pyrophosphorylase and of phosphorylase activities were also found at all stages of development. The possible role of phosphorylase in starch synthesis could not be discounted. The levels of phosphorylase, ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, starch synthetase, and UDPglucose pyrophosphorylase activities in shrunken- 4 kernels were about 20 to 40 % of that found in normal maize kernels. It appears that the mutation in shrunken- 4 affects the activities of more than one enzyme. The defective starch synthesis seen in this mutant could be due to the low activities of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase and starch synthetase rather than the low activity of phosphorylase...|$|R
40|$|A few {{families}} of retrotransposons {{characterized by the}} presence of long terminal repeats (LTRs) have amplified relatively recently in maize and account for > 50 % of the genome. Surprisingly, none of these elements have been shown to cause a single mutation. In contrast, most of the retrotransposon-induced mutations isolated in maize are caused by the insertion of elements that are present in the genome at 2 - 50 copies. To begin to understand what limits the amplification of this mutagenic class of LTR-retrotransposons, we are focusing on five elements previously identified among 17 mutations of the <b>maize</b> <b>waxy</b> gene. One of these elements, Stonor, has sustained a deletion of the entire gag region and part of the protease domain. Missing sequences were recovered from larger members of the Stonor family and indicate that the deletion probably occurred during retrotransposition. These large elements have an exceptionally long leader of 2 kb that includes a highly variable region of approximately 1 kb that has not been seen in previously characterized retrotransposons. This region serves to distinguish each member of the Stonor family and indicates that no single element has yet evolved that can attain the very high copy numbers characteristic of other element families in maize...|$|R
50|$|The starch {{of normal}} dent maize is characterised by a content of about 25% amylose with the {{remainder}} being amylopectin and the intermediate fraction (see 3.5 Biochemistry). But these percentages vary among cultivars and with kernel development. For example, amylose percentage ranged from 20 to 36% for 399 cultivars of normal maize.

For some scholars {{it was difficult to}} conceive that from 1516 on the American plant had had time to penetrate into a wild country inaccessible to foreigners, to produce a mutation, and as such a mutant to spread from the Philippines to Northern Manchuria and the Primorsky region within three to four hundred years.|$|E
50|$|In 1937, {{just before}} World War II, G.F.

40|$|Maize {{starches}} {{with different}} amylose content were investigated by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

The melting process of <b>waxy</b> and normal <b>maize</b> starches could be described {{by means of a}} `two-state' model. The melting process of the maize starches, which contained at least 50 % (w/w) amylose, were described as the melting of a mixture of low and high temperature populations of double-helical type crystallites, denoted as B- and B*-type, as well as the melting of V-type crystallites. The relative amounts of the three structures were determined by deconvolution of the calorimetric peaks. The values of the melting co-operative units (ν) and the thickness of crystalline lamellae (pitch heights) for low (waxy and normal) and high amylose starches were determined using a mathematical model describing the melting process. The ν in A- and B-type crystals were calculated as 13. 7 ± 1. 7 and 30. 6 ± 5. 0 glucose units, respectively.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} plastid {{and nuclear}} gene expression in tobacco seedlings using the carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor nor-flurazon. mRNA levels for three nuclear-encoded chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystem I and photosystem II (CAB I and II and the CP 24 apoprotein) {{are no longer}} detectable in photobleached seedlings, whereas those for other components of the thylakoid membrane (the 33 - and 23 -kD polypeptides and Rieske Fe/S polypeptide) accumulate to some extent. Transgenic tobacco seedlings with promoter fusions from genes for thylakoid membrane proteins exhibit a similar expression behavior: a CAB-[beta]-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion is not expressed in herbicide-treated seedlings, whereas PC-, FNR-, PSAF-, and ATPC-promoter fusions are expressed, although at reduced levels. All identified segments in nuclear promoters analyzed that {{have been shown to}} respond to light also respond to photodamage to the plastids. Thus, the regulatory signal pathways either merge prior to gene regulation or interact with closely neighboring cis elements. These results indicate that plastids control nuclear gene expression via different and gene-specific cis-regulatory elements and that CAB gene expression is different from the expression of the other genes tested. Finally, a plastid-directing import sequence from the <b>maize</b> <b>Waxy</b> gene is capable of directing the GUS protein into the photodamaged organelle. Therefore, plastid import seems to be functional in photobleached organelles...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{reported in}} this thesis was concerned {{with a series of}} mutations at the <b>waxy</b> locus in <b>maize.</b> Dr. Barbara McClintock who provided the original material used in this thesis also gave the explanation of the genetics behavior of the mutation inducing Ac-Ds system (14). The waxy mutants which occurred in this material were isolated and identified by starch-lodine titrations. The mutant starches identified in two or more selfed generations covered a range of amylose percentage from the waxy type to the starchy type. Three intermediate mutants produced starch calculated to contain 20, 9 and 3. 42 percent amylose;Gene dosage effects of the starchy, waxy and three intermediate types were studied in a series of reciprocal crosses. The effects on starch properties were analyzed by means of the sample iodine titration values, viscosity readings end gal strength measurements. The reciprocal crosses showed that of two alleles, the one which conditioned the higher amylose content was partially dominant over the other. The female parent in reciprocal crosses had greater effects than the male;The method of selection of presumed mutants was expected to minimize the frequency of intermediate mutants. Likewise the number of mutants at or near the starchy and waxy types was expected to be high. The number of intermediate mutants found was higher than either extreme type. This unexpected result may have been the effect of an accumulation of mutations which occurred before the sampling took place. The appearance of these intermediate mutants was in contradiction to the hypothesis of Sager (17) that metabolism conditioned by the waxy locus acts as a phenotypic filter through which new allele do not pass. The homogeneous nature of the starch granules of these mutant types provided a sharp contrast in physical properties of the starch pastes to the heterogeneous mechanical mixtures. The viscosity and gel strength measurements for the gene dosage samples and for the mechanical mixtures were interpreted in terms of the swelling of the starch granules...|$|R
