5|$|A {{number of}} {{improvement}} works {{are planned for}} Tonkin Highway, which will see most of the central and northern sections upgraded to a freeway-standard road with grade separated interchanges. Extensions are also planned {{at both ends of}} the highway, which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> southern end extended to South Western Highway south of Byford, and link the northern end to the future Perth Darwin National Highway near Ballajura.|$|E
5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E

Phase Three <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> replacement of the Railway Station.

5|$|In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation {{of local}} {{government}} in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two county boroughs (Belfast and Derry) by 26 single-tier districts, which, apart from Fermanagh cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as Lieutenancy. In November 2005, proposals were announced which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> number of local authorities reduced to seven.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{some of the}} CRG {{radicals}} including Wang Li and Guan Feng {{were arrested}} on the orders of Mao, {{but by the end}} of the Cultural Revolution the new drive to eradicate 'ultra-leftists' <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> arrest of nearly all of the CRG's members (Jiang Qing would survive until the death of Mao).|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day the Red Sox won Game 3, The Boston Globes Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought the Red Sox on the verge of winning a World Series, he {{wondered}} how many people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox and hoping that one day, they <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E

5|$|The {{authors of}} War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920 divided {{a war with}} Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the {{garrison}} of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet made its way from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms.|$|E
5|$|The close {{geographic}} and cultural {{ties between the}} Riverina and northern Victoria, combined with continuing frustration with inter colonial tariffs, made the Riverina a fertile area for ideas for uniting the various colonies in an Australian federation. This <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> southern Riverina in particular take {{a leading role in}} bringing about federation.|$|E
5|$|As {{a primary}} route to southwestern England, the A303 is {{frequently}} congested on its single carriageway sections. As {{it passes through}} the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, attempts to upgrade the road in those areas have been controversial. In particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> A303 rerouted underground, has been proposed and delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving, and was commemorated in a book and BBC Four television documentary by Tom Fort in the early 2010s.|$|E

5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Resurrection was {{originally}} {{set for a}} Christmas 2004 release. However, Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games before the release for trademark and copyright infringement. Faced with a threat of legal action, the project was publicly closed on September 6, 2004. According to the development team, the website of the project had received significant hits from Square Enix Japanese IP addresses {{for a period of}} three months before the letter issuing. They assumed these visits were mostly from employees rather than top executives, and hoped the company <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> demo as how the team sees it, a tribute to Chrono Trigger rather than a replacement.|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 season <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Senators {{qualify for}} the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time, in {{dramatic}} fashion. They clinched the seventh seed on the last game {{of the regular season}} thanks to a late goal from Steve Duchesne against the Buffalo Sabres' Dominik Hasek, giving the Senators a 1–0 win and the first playoff appearance for an Ottawa-based team in 67 years. The Senators then faced Buffalo {{in the first round of}} the playoffs and were eliminated in the full seven games. Despite holding a lead in Game 7, Alexei Yashin put the puck in his own net, allowing Buffalo to tie the game and eventually win the game and the series on a goal by Derek Plante in overtime.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American War of Independence had caused relations between France and Great Britain to deteriorate, and diplomatic ties were broken on 16 March 1778. Admiral d'Estaing took command of a squadron of thirteen ships {{of the line and}} four frigates in Toulon. Marseillois was assigned to this fleet, the first active service she <b>would</b> <b>see.</b> <b>The</b> fleet set sail on 18 April 1778, crossed Gibraltar on 16 May, and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Delaware River on 8 July.|$|E
5|$|While {{the early}} 19th century had seen rapid {{progress}} in electrical science, the late 19th century <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life, becoming {{a driving force}} of the Second Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|A true sequel series, {{tentatively}} titled IRIS 2, {{was originally}} announced for October 2011. At {{the time of}} announcement, pre-production was underway and reports estimated filming on the sequel was expected to commence in March 2011. Representatives from Taewon Productions stated in April 2010 that they expected original stars Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae-hee, and Kim So-yeon to be cast in the sequel. Later, {{just prior to the}} finale of Athena being broadcast, lead producer Chung Tae-won confirmed that he anticipated IRIS 2 to be in production in time for a fall 2012 premiere. Concurrently, it was reported that the proposed series remained in pre-production with the scriptwriters in the process of crafting the story. Chung also revealed that no casting decisions had been made and that the writing staff were preparing two potential versions of the series as a result—one featuring the full original cast and another that <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> return of only a select few. The leads of the original series, Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee, were officially confirmed to ultimately not be reprising their roles for the sequel on August 24, 2012.|$|E

5|$|After the {{previous}} German Grand Prix (at the Nürburgring) in July 2009, {{the future of}} the race was in doubt after the government of Baden-Württemberg and the town of Hockenheim withdrew their funding for the event. Planned discussions between the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone and the Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg Günther Oettinger to renegotiate the expenses for hosting the event had ended after Ecclestone made controversial comments regarding Adolf Hitler, and the organisers of the Nürburgring circuit announced that they would not hold the race in 2010 because of a commitment to hold the event the following year. An agreement was reached in September which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> event run until 2018 with both circuit's management and Formula One Management agreeing to cover any losses incurred.|$|E
5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 4th Army {{began to}} {{withdraw}} southwards on 9 April. On {{the evening of}} 9 April, Generaloberst Maximilian von Weichs, commander of the German 2nd Army, was ready to launch major offensive operations from the bridgeheads on the following day. His plan involved two main thrusts. The first would be spearheaded by the 14th Panzer Division breaking out of the Zákány bridgehead and drive towards Zagreb, and the second <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> 8th Panzer Division {{break out of the}} bridgehead in the sector of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska and turn east between the Drava and Sava to attack towards Belgrade. On the night of 9/10 April, those Croats that had remained with their units also began to desert or turn on their commanders, and in the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on the right flank of the 27th Infantry Division Savska, almost all the remaining troops were Serbs. Due to the increasing momentum of the revolt, Petrović concluded that the 4th Army was no longer an effective formation and could not resist the Germans.|$|E
