The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement.

Catherine {{witnessed}} her mother {{shot and killed by}} two hitmen who were then killed by Vincent. Catherine refused to believe the official police report that her mother's death was that of carjacking gone wrong since the men who killed her mother suddenly appeared and began shooting <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> word, as well as that the two dead killers identities were never found in any police record, leading Catherine to believe that her mother's killing was that of a government conspiracy. It was later revealed that Catherine's mother worked for Muirfield, conducting the experiments, and ultimately helped turn Vincent into a beast. Catherine must deal with conflicted feelings of her mother's memory across this season, having been determined to solve her case for all this time. When Catherine watches her father get run over in the season finale, she then learns that, biologically, he was not her real father after all.|$|E

The {{importance}} of business process management goes <b>without</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>As</b> its realization is less straightforward, maturity {{models have been}} developed to gradually assess and improve business processes. Although their aim is to assist organizations, the proliferation of maturity models also confuses organizations. They have no overview of existing models and their differences, which makes an informed choice difficult. Choosing the right business process maturity model (BPMM) is however important, as previous research indicated the existence of different maturity types being measured by the existing models [1]. We now add further design elements to our comparative framework by conducting a content analysis of 69 BPMMs. Afterwards, the identified design elements are transformed into a questionnaire that practitioners can use to find the BPMM that best fits their needs. In this paper, we present 16 questions {{to be included in the}} questionnaire, without elaborating on the mapping of individual maturity models...|$|R
