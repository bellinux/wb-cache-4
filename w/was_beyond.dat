Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E

Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00 am on 25 August, {{the newly}} erected French gun battery {{opened fire on}} Sirius and Iphigenia, which {{returned}} fire as best they could. Accepting that Sirius <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> repair, Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies, setting fire to the frigate at 9:00 am, shortly after Iphigenia had pulled beyond {{the range of the}} battery, using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day. French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck. The frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide, who wet the decks to prevent any risk of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington {{and marched}} into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26. Washington's army unsuccessfully {{attacked}} the British garrison at Germantown in early October. Meanwhile, to the north, Burgoyne <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the reach of}} help from Howe, trapped and forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga. This was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically—the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide affair.|$|E
5|$|Biographers Fraser and Navarro {{wrote that}} Eva Perón {{has often been}} {{credited}} with gaining {{the right to vote}} for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and also published articles in her Democracia newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right to vote, ultimately the ability to grant to women the right to vote <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> Eva's powers. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|By 1541, King Henry VIII of England {{had broken}} with the Church of Rome and {{declared}} himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. The pope's grant of Ireland to the English monarch became invalid, so Henry summoned {{a meeting of}} the Irish Parliament to change his title from Lord of Ireland to King of Ireland. However much of the island <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> English control, resulting in the extended Tudor conquest of Ireland that only made the Kingdom of Ireland a reality in 1603, {{at the conclusion of the}} Nine Years' War (Ireland). Nevertheless, Ireland retained its own parliament, becoming an independent state in 1642-1649 (Confederate Ireland), and again in 1688-91. Only warfare such as the Williamite War in Ireland and subsequent occupation enabled the English crown from 1692, and successive British states from 1707, to retain the country.|$|E

5|$|Congressional {{delegations}} {{from the}} Southern states, which had lower or no debts, and whose citizens would effectively pay {{a portion of}} the debt of other states if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Additionally, many in Congress argued that the plan <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson approved payment of the domestic and foreign debt at par, but not the assumption of state debts. After Hamilton and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of PedroI the Chamber of Deputies was never {{dissolved}} and legislative sessions were never extended or postponed.

There were eleven dissolutions during PedroII's reign and, of these, ten occurred after consultation with the Council of State, which <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> what was required by the Constitution. A Constitutional balance of power existed between the General Assembly and the executive branch under the Emperor. The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly. The system functioned smoothly only when both Assembly and Emperor acted in a spirit of cooperation for the national good.|$|E
