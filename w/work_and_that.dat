He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it came through in his performances.|$|E
5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he should not be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions {{to a new level}} of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E

5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|Tischendorf {{believed}} that four separate scribes (whom he named A, B, C and D) copied the <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> five correctors (whom he designated a, b, c, d and e) amended portions. He posited {{that one of}} the correctors was contemporaneous with the original scribes, and that the others worked in the 6th and 7th centuries. It is now agreed, after Milne and Skeat's reinvestigation, that Tischendorf was wrong—scribe C never existed. According to Tischendorf, scribe C wrote the poetic books of the Old Testament. These are written in a different format {{from the rest of the}} manuscript – they appear in two columns (the rest of books is in four columns), written stichometrically. Tischendorf probably interpreted the different formatting as indicating the existence of another scribe. The three remaining scribes are still identified by the letters that Tischendorf gave them: A, B, and D. Correctors were more, at least seven (a, b, c, ca, cb, cc, e).|$|E

25|$|Robert Roth {{argues that}} Hume's {{histories}} display his biases against Presbyterians and Puritans. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished {{the influence of}} his <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect {{of social and economic}} history.|$|E

25|$|In {{psychological}} {{experiments that}} test how workers respond when {{the meaning of}} their task is diminished, the test condition {{is referred to as}} the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder when they can imagine meaning in their <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.|$|E

An additional 600 unsettled claims related to birth defects. The lawsuits produced thousands of internal company documents, some of which entered the public domain.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some argue {{psychotherapy}} is under-utilized and under-researched by contemporary psychiatry despite offering more promise than stagnant medication development. In 2015 the US National Institute of Mental Health is allocating only 5.4% {{of its budget}} to new clinical trials of psychotherapies (medication trials are largely funded by pharmaceutical companies), despite plentiful evidence they can <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> patients {{are more likely to}} prefer them.|$|E

Late in 1950, Randall wrote to Franklin to inform her that rather than work on protein, she should take advantage of Wilkins's preliminary <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> she should do X-ray studies of DNA fibers made from Signer's samples of DNA.|$|E
25|$|Some critics {{believe that}} Marlowe sought to {{disseminate}} these views in his <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he identified with his rebellious and iconoclastic protagonists. However, plays {{had to be}} approved by the Master of the Revels before they could be performed, and the censorship of publications was {{under the control of the}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Presumably these authorities did not consider any of Marlowe's works to be unacceptable other than the Amores.|$|E
25|$|Several {{specific}} {{dimensions of}} Sahagún's <b>work</b> (<b>and</b> <b>that</b> of other Franciscans in New Spain) reflect this philosophical anthropology.

In Sahagún's collaborative approach, in which he consistently gave credit to his collaborators, especially Antonio Valeriano, the Franciscan value of community is expressed.|$|E
