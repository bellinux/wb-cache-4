5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that gripped the country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> works that were forbidden.|$|E

5|$|Reconstructing a {{timetable}} for {{the day of the}} battle is tentative due to ambiguous statements in Ammianus (which may have been caused by manuscript copying-errors). It appears that Julian's army set forth at dawn, and apparently arrived within sight of the barbarian entrenchments (vallum) outside Strasbourg at around midday, after a march of 21 Roman miles. (A contradictory statement in Julian's speech implies that the army was still far off its destination and faced a night march to reach it. But this is incompatible <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> available data and should thus probably be disregarded). The starting-point was probably Saverne, since this is the last stated location of Julian's army, and it lay a consistent distance from Strasbourg on the Roman highway.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{entered the}} FA Cup, the {{foremost}} cup competition in England, in the Fifth Qualifying Round along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{teams in the}} Third Division North. For their first match, played on 29 November 1924, the team was drawn to play Winsford United of the Cheshire County League at Seedhill. Nelson won the first ever meeting between the two clubs 4–1 with goals from Braidwood, Eddleston, O'Beirne and Wolstenholme, to progress to the Sixth Qualifying Round {{for the first time}} in three years. In the next round Nelson were again given a home tie, against Second Division outfit Coventry City, who would be relegated to the Third Division North at the end of the 1924–25 campaign. Nelson made only one change from the side that had defeated Winsford, with Eddie Cameron replacing Arthur Wolstenholme. In front of a crowd of 7,000 spectators, one of the highest attendances at Seedhill of the season, Coventry won 1–0 to progress to the first round proper of the competition.|$|E
5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, England's bowlers {{continued}} to make regular inroads. Ward fell in the third over of the day, and the debutant Lindsay Hassett was dismissed soon after, leaving Australia at 5/150. McCabe, who had hit two boundaries thus far in the morning, was joined by Jack Badcock. The former {{continued to}} score boundaries regularly, and hit Sinfield for four and three from a leg glance and late cut to reach his 50 in 90 minutes. He then hit Hammond for consecutive on-driven fours before Badcock fell at 6/194, having made only 9 of the 43 runs in their partnership. McCabe had struck 62 of the 83 runs added since {{he had come to}} the crease. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> specialist batsmen dismissed, McCabe was now batting with wicket-keeper Ben Barnett and began to attack the English bowlers with powerful drives and hook shots. Hammond brought back Farnes to try and finish off the tail, but McCabe responded by hitting three fours in one over, forcing the English captain to remove his fast bowler after McCabe had hooked him for six.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} when Specter, a white-haired monkey who is {{well-known}} {{at his home}} in a monkey-themed amusement park, puts on an experimental Peak Point Helmet created by a Professor, which increases his intelligence beyond that of a regular monkey, but also twists his mind, turning him evil. Imbued with this new power, Specter gives Pipo Helmets to all the monkeys in the park and sets them loose, having them take over the local laboratory where the Professor and his assistant Natalie (Katie/Natsumi) are currently building a time machine. As Spike (Kakeru) and his best friend Jake (Buzz/Hiroki) arrive at the laboratory, they find themselves transported by Specter, along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> monkeys, to the various reaches of time. Realizing that leaving the monkeys to their own devices could rewrite history in disastrous ways, the Professor tasks Spike with finding all of the monkeys scattered across time and sending them back to the present.|$|E
5|$|While Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and a newly {{returned}} Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) head to Galactica, {{the advancing}} Cylons destroy one ship and damage others, {{killing at least}} 600. After discovering their true identities, Cylons Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) continue their jobs. Tigh is ordered to send every Viper to defend the fleet, but has a vision where he assassinates Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) before carrying it out. New Viper pilot Anders is sent out, worried a hidden Cylon program would activate and make him turn against the fleet. His guns are unresponsive while targeting a Raider. As Anders and the Raider come face-to-face, the Raider scans Anders, and in doing so, Anders' iris momentarily glows red. In response to this, the Raider flips direction and it, along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Raiders, immediately stop the attack and retreat to their basestar and jump away, much {{to the surprise of}} the fleet.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} short {{development}} times for new systems {{is based on}} the increasing pressures of competition. Beside this there is a shortfall between the high number of product variants demanded by the market and the low number of variants that manufacturers wish to supply. Therefore systems should be divided into components with standardized interfaces. The components themselves can often be divided repeatedly into subcomponents. Single components need short development times and can be combined to form a large number of product variants. This causes a new problem because the components have to be managed. Not every component fits <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> <b>The</b> solution is to use a computer aided configuring system.
