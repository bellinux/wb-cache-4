500|$|On November 16, 2009, {{the paper}} was {{abruptly}} shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media, and its majority shareholder, Avalon Equity Partners. [...] Employees at the Blade were aware of Window Media's financial troubles, but the timing and total closure of the publication {{came as a shock}} to the entire staff. [...] Kevin Naff, editor of the Blade, said employees [...] "found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work this morning". [...] Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication's finances, the same day the Blade shut down, Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers [...] "We're all together. Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning." [...] Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a [...] "weekly must-read", and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington's LGBT community.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Studio City, California on Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center. It was filmed on April 10, 11, and 13, 2006. The make-up effects used in Grace's dream and the scenes fifteen {{years into the future}} were done by Academy Award-winning make-up artists. Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing and hugging each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the last time I stood in Will's kitchen. That was the most colorful position for me, standing there and stirring something. It was my pulpit, the place where I delivered my best jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was messing around with {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] stopped me and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fooling around with it in the studio, we ended up doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Charlie's Angels series {{formally}} debuted on September 22, 1976. Each of {{the three}} actresses was propelled to stardom, but Fawcett dominated popularity polls and was soon proclaimed a phenomenon. She subsequently won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Performer in a New TV Program. In a 1977 interview with TV Guide, she said, [...] "When the show was number three, I thought it was our acting. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be number one, I decided {{it could only be}} because none of us wears a bra." ...|$|E

"We used a {{technique}} of laying our program out in general debate," [...] he said. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the amendment phase, we would offer our {{program as a}} substitute for the Johnson proposal. If we lost in the Committee of the Whole, then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that. And if we lost on the motion to recommit, our Republican members had a choice: They could vote against the Johnson program and say we did our best {{to come up with a}} better alternative. Or they could vote for it and make the same argument. Usually we lost; but when you're only 140 out of 435, you don't expect to win many.|$|E

2500|$|The group chose Calliope Studios {{as their}} primary studio, as it was renown to promote artistic freedom. Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah and Prince Paul with De La Soul and Stetsasonic, were all {{recording}} new music in separate rooms while A Tribe Called Quest recorded People’s Instinctive Travels. Q-Tip later commented [...] "It was exciting. We were kinda left to our own devices. It was just a great environment, conductive for creating. We didn’t have cell phones, we didn’t have the internet, we didn’t {{have a bunch of}} things to tear at us. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the studio, the specific job was to make music.

2500|$|I was at {{the post}} office with my Mum and Auntie [...] They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [...] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were {{screaming}} in the back of that car. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old.

2500|$|In early 2000, Radiohead {{toured the}} Mediterranean, {{performing}} Kid A and Amnesiac songs {{for the first}} time. By the time the album title was announced in mid-2000, fans were sharing concert bootlegs on the peer-to-peer service Napster. Colin Greenwood said: [...] "We played in Barcelona {{and the next day}} the entire performance was up on Napster. Three weeks later <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> play in Israel the audience knew the words to all the new songs and it was wonderful." [...] Kid A was leaked online and shared via Napster three weeks before release. Asked whether he believed Napster had damaged sales, Capitol president Ray Lott likened the situation to unfounded concern about home taping in the 1980s and said: [...] "I'm trying to sell as many Radiohead albums as possible. If I worried about what Napster would do, I wouldn't sell as many albums." [...] Yorke said Napster [...] "encourages enthusiasm for music {{in a way that the}} music industry has long forgotten to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, in a {{convergence}} of cyberpunk art and reality, the United States Secret Service raided Steve Jackson Games's headquarters and confiscated all their computers. Officials denied that the target had been the GURPS Cyberpunk sourcebook, but Jackson would later write {{that he and his}} colleagues [...] "were never able to secure the return of the complete manuscript; [...] The Secret Service at first flatly refused to return anything – then agreed to let us copy files, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> their office, restricted us to one set of out-of-date files – then agreed to make copies for us, but said [...] "tomorrow" [...] every day from March 4 to March 26. On March 26 we received a set of disks which purported to be our files, but the material was late, incomplete and well-nigh useless." [...] Steve Jackson Games won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new Electronic Frontier Foundation. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of GURPS Cyberpunk have a tagline on the front cover, which reads [...] "The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!" [...] Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.|$|E
2500|$|The Advance {{in ballast}} got {{underway}} for Port Stephens at about 7 o’clock yesterday (Monday) morning, from the Government wharf, Botany Bay {{there was a}} light breeze from the SE at the time, but the weather was overcast, and the wind gradually freshened till, about three quarters of an hour afterwards, it was blowing a strong gale. We attempted to beat out, and made one board across from {{the south side of the}} bay, near Captain Cook's monument towards La Perouse As we proceeded it was thought that she would be able to get right out, but when nearing La Perouse the wind headed us [...] veering more to the eastward, and we had to go around in an attempting, to do so the vessel missed stays. We filled on her, as there was no room to wear we made another attempt to stay her She would not stay, however, and the anchor was accordingly let go, which brought her up A kedge was then run out to try and heave her off and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work the vessel was gradually being dragged off when the line unfortunately gave way. All this time the schooner was hanging by the anchor, with her stern just clear of the rocks, and the surf was beginning to break in heavily. Just after the kedge line parted, the pawls of the windlass gave way, and then, nothing holding her she headed right round for the rocks, upon which she was dashed very shortly afterwards We had just enough time to snatch up some of our clothes, get into the boat, which was alongside and pull away. We pulled out Into the bay, and the schooner Harold bound from Wollongong to the waterworks with a cargo of coal coming up at the time we got on board of her and were all landed safely at the Waterworks, whence we came on to Sydney ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
