In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. <b>Weapons</b> <b>of</b> this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|E

There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E
