5|$|A National Loan Act {{provided}} for $2 million in bonds, {{but due to}} its poor creditworthiness, the kingdom {{had been unable to}} sell them. Gibson hit upon the idea of combining the two acts by appointing businessman Claus Spreckels, a close friend of the king, as government agent to contract with the United States Mint to have coins struck there, and for Spreckels to be paid in government bonds. In March 1883, the cabinet council authorized Finance Minister John M. Kapena to make the arrangement with Spreckels, who received formal authority for this role in May. H.A.P. Carter, Hawaiian envoy in Washington, acted as intermediary between the Hawaiians and the US government, and wrote to Kapena in June that the US authorities regarded the agency arrangement as peculiar, since a more usual way of proceeding <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the Hawaiian government to contract directly, and to pay for the coins in cash.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the-then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade {{and offered to}} develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo. Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way optimisations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult than it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo.|$|E

Greg Street, Birkdale Road, and Broadstone Hall Road South have mid-19th century terraces built by the Gregs for the workers at their (demolished) Victoria and Albert Mills.

25|$|There {{were three}} {{possible}} ways to update it. The cheapest {{would have been}} to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, the {{railroad}} gained {{a connection with}} the Kings County Elevated Railway {{by means of a}} ramp and short elevated railway. The connection connected with the Fulton Street Elevated, which ran from Downtown Brooklyn to Jamaica and was completed in 1893. From there the line bridged over Atlantic Avenue, where the LIRR was still operating at grade. As part of the Atlantic Avenue Improvement program, this portion of the LIRR was submerged in a tunnel between 1903 and 1905. There would have been a future connection from the Atlantic Branch to the Brighton Line, for which provisions were provided. This connection <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> two tracks, but it was never built. However, space in the tunnel wall, a bellmouth, was provided for this connection. Then the line connected to the existing line several blocks to the south.|$|E

25|$|During the American Revolutionary War, {{a policy}} {{similar to the}} Navy's Press Gangs was introduced. Two acts were passed, the Recruiting Act 1778 and the Recruiting Act 1779, for the impressment of individuals. For some men this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> being drunk and disorderly. The chief {{advantages}} of these acts was {{in the number of}} volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the thumb and forefinger of the right hand. Both acts were repealed in 1780. The British Government also released criminals and debtors from prison on the condition they joined the army. Three entire regiments during the American Revolution were raised from this early release programme. Of the Volunteer recruits, some would find they had been enticed to take the King's shilling under false pretenses and many men would find they had signed to a lifetime in the army.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

A member of the helicopter crew explained: [...] "There were two people waving their jackets and pointing into the river. Initially we thought 'Why are they not in the water helping?' what looked like a child face down in the water.

500|$|The [...] "Terri Schiavo case" [...] {{actually}} {{refers to}} a series of cases. It differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. In 2006, Shepherd said that it was [...] "unclear" [...] whether the Schiavo case represents a landmark decision. The Schiavo case instead involved a dispute between family members over what Schiavo's wishes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> such a situation. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, [...] "The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan." [...] The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, Guardianship of Estelle Browning. In that case, George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo in the Schiavo case, represented a Browning relative. Felos successfully argued before the Florida Supreme Court that Browning's feeding tube should be removed. The elderly Browning had expressed in a living will her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water [...] "by a gastric tube or intravenously." [...] At that time it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a landmark ruling, the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had [...] "the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one's health." ...|$|E
