500|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott {{said that}} the film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E

I've been round the world twice, and I've done nothing but enjoy myself since I left college,--or try to. When I first saw you I was hesitating about letting my father make me of use.

[...] "I would not think that I was not mindful of them from the very beginning."

[...] "Come into the house;--come at once." [...] And then, within her father's arms, while her stepmother listened, she told them of her triumph.

I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon {{they go to the}} bottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business.

A great actress or a great lady--sometimes she inclines for one and sometimes for the other, {{but on the whole}} persuading herself that a great actress, if she'll cultivate the right people, may be a great lady. When I tell her that won't do and that a great actress can never be anything but a great vagabond, then the dear old thing has tantrums, and we have scenes--the most grotesque: they'd make the fortune, for a subject, of some play-writing rascal, if he had the wit to guess them; which, luckily for us perhaps, he never will. She usually winds up by protesting--devinez un peu quoi!" [...] Miriam added.

6000|$|A cat {{had made}} {{acquaintance}} with a mouse, and had spoken {{so much of}} the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at last the Mouse consented to live in the same house with her, and to go shares in the housekeeping. 'But we must provide for the winter or else we shall suffer hunger,' said the Cat. 'You, little Mouse, cannot venture everywhere in case you run at last into a trap.' This good counsel was followed, and a little pot of fat was bought. But they did not know where to put it. At length, after long consultation, the Cat said, 'I know of no place where it could be better put than in the church. No one will trouble to take it away from there. We will hide it in a corner, and we won't touch it till we are in want.' So the little pot was placed in safety; but it was not long before the Cat had a great longing for it, and said to the Mouse, 'I wanted to tell you, little Mouse, that my cousin has a little son, white with brown spots, and she <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> godmother to it. Let me go out to-day, and do you take care of the house alone.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jeff, after a moment, [...] "as much as I ever did; and more. But I've been thinking, {{since the}} thing happened, that, if I'd {{cared for her}} {{the way she did}} for me, it wouldn't have happened. Look here, Jackson! You know I've never pretended to be like some men--like Mr. Westover, for example--always looking out for the right and the wrong, and all that. I didn't make myself, and I guess if the Almighty don't make me go right it's because He don't want me to. But I have got a {{conscience}} about Cynthy, and I'd be willing to help out a little if I knew how, about her. The devil of it is, I've got to being afraid. I don't mean that I'm not fit for her; any man's fit for any woman if he wants her bad enough; but I'm afraid I sha'n't ever care for her in the right way. That's the point. I've cared for just one woman in this world, and it a'n't Cynthy, as far as I can make out. But she's gone, and I guess I could coax Cynthy round again, and I could be what she <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> after this." ...|$|E
