40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} a leading of cause of cancer related death in men. Despite {{intensive}} in-vestment in improving early diagnosis, it often escapes timely detection. Mortality remains high in advanced stage prostate cancer <b>where</b> palliative <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> the only option. Effec-tive strategies are therefore needed {{to prevent the occurrence}} and progression of the dis-ease. Plant-derived compounds have been an important source of several clinically useful anti-cancer agents and offer an attractive approach against prostate cancer. We previously showed that the methanol extract of Maytenus royleanus (MEM) leaves and its fractions possess significant antioxidant activity with therapeutic potential against free-radical associ-ated damages. The present study evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of MEM in the prostate cancer model system. Analysis of MEM and its various fractions revealed the pres-ence of triterpenoids, flavonoids and tannins, conjugated to one or more polar groups and carbohydrate moieties.

40|$|Cuba has {{developed}} a programme of quality improvement of its health services, which includes an extramural emergency care system in which polyclinics and general practitioner networks play an important role. Using routine health information from the decentralised first line emergency units (FLES) and from the hospital emergency service (HES) for the period 1995 - 2000, we evaluated {{the effects of the}} emergency care subsystem reform on the utilisation rates of first line and hospital services in Baracoa and Cerro, a rural and a metropolitan municipality, respectively. In the self-contained health system of Baracoa, the reform of the emergency subsystem resulted in a first phase of increased utilisation of the FLES, followed by a second phase of gradual decrease, during which there was an increased utilisation of general practitioners. In contrast, the overall results of the reform in Cerro were unclear. The proximity to a hospital seems {{to be the most important}} element in the patient's decision on which entry point to the Cerro health system to use. A potential adverse effect of the reform is an increased emergency services utilisation in situations <b>where</b> GP <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> below patients' expectations. Given the current world-wide trends in health-care reform, the organisational alternatives developed in the Cuban health system might remain specific to the local contextual setting.

Time course analysis of MEM treated prostate cancer cells indicated significant decrease in cell viability, assessed by MTT and clonogenic survival assays. This was accompanied by G 2 phase arrest of cell cycle, downregulation of cyclin/cdk network and increase in cdk inhibitors. MEM treated cells exhibited cleavage of Caspase- 3 and PARP, and modulation of apoptotic proteins, establishing apoptosis as the primary mechanism of cell death. Notably MEM suppressed AR/PSA signaling both in prostate cancer cell cultures and in the in vivo model. Intraperitoneal injection of MEM (1. 25 and 2. 5 mg/ animal) to athymic nude mice implanted with androgen sensitive CWR 22 Rν 1 cells showed significant inhibition in tumor growth and decreased serum PSA levels reciprocating in vitro findings. Taken together, our data suggest that MEM may be explored further for its potential therapeutic effects against prostate cancer progression in humans...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Access {{to health}} <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> an {{important}} issue facing many individuals. Barriers to health care include financial factors, characteristics of the individuals and {{of the health care}} delivery system, as well as geographicalfactors. Using a telephone survey of Ken-tucky residents, this study investigated the relationship between the road quality and county elevation and access to health carefor individuals in rural and urban areas of the state. Control-ling the comparison for known individual characteristics, community characteristics, and medi-cal infrastructure characteristics, this study uncovered that worse road conditions, mea-sured by a road “rideability ” index, were associated with longer times to reach medical care. It also found an association between higher county elevations and shorter times to reach medical care. A ccess to health <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> an impor-tant issue for many groups of people, including those living in rural areas, individuals who are poor or uninsured, and members of different minority groups.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the extent to}} which the Basic Benefit Package (BBP), a subsidized health program in Armenia, increases utilization and affordability of outpatient health care among the poor.

However, even among BBP beneficiaries the level of outpatient health <b>care</b> utilization <b>remains</b> low. This occurs because the program mainly provides discounted fees for doctor visits, but fees do not constitute the main financial constraint for users. The authors estimate suggest that other non-fee expenditures, such as prescription medicines, constitute a more significant financial constraint and are not subsidized by the BBP. As a result, outpatient health <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> expensive even for BBP beneficiaries.
