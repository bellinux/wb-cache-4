5|$|Early Jain texts {{were not}} {{composed}} in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language. According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing {{form of a}} substantial anekantavada doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era. These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{program had}} {{positive}} effects on students’ academic performance. Nearly every PT and tutored student achieved the learning outcomes of the Vocational English modules. For the PTs, as suggested by Gaustad [2], the time spent on revising <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> tutees and explaining the learning materials to them reinforced {{their understanding of the}} subject knowledge. As for the peer tutees, the PTs helped them to study more effectively by giving them individual instruction and support whenever they encountered problems. The students’ learning motivation was increased, which was in line with previous findings [3]. The PTs reported being eager to study the learning materials before classes and to consult their teachers frequently to be better prepared for teaching <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> tutees. Meanwhile, peer tutees were willing to revise what they had learnt and continually seek support from their PTs and teachers. They also expressed more positive attitudes towards English learning. The scheme also boosted students’ confidence in learning English as they had support from <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> Furthermore, the program fostered students’ ownership in learning and encouraged outside classroom learning. Some PTs voluntarily studied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> tutees on campus after school. A bigger pleasant surprise was that a few PTs organized an online video discussion group to practice vocabulary pronunciation and oral presentation <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> tutees. All of these additional experiences enabled PTs to feel worthwhile and valuable, while giving peer tutees more opportunities to learn from <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> outside normal lessons.|$|R

25|$|From {{the late}} 1970s {{to the early}} 1990s many Americans assumed {{as a matter of}} course that students' {{self-esteem}} acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earn in school, in their relationships <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers,</b> and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.|$|E
25|$|Although {{individuals}} with FXS have difficulties in forming friendships, those with FXS and ASD characteristically also have difficulties with reciprocal conversation <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> Social withdrawal behaviors, including avoidance and indifference, {{appear to be}} the best predictors of ASD in FXS, with avoidance appearing to be correlated more with social anxiety while indifference was more strongly correlated to severe ASD. When both autism and FXS are present, a greater language deficit and lower IQ is observed as compared to children with only FXS.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{because of}} the {{differences}} in language and culture, students are often placed in lower classes due to their lack of English proficiency. Students can also be made to repeat classes {{because of the}}ir lack of English proficiency, even if they have mastered the content of the class. When schools have the resources and are able to provide separate classes for refugee students to develop their English skills, it can take the average refugee students only three months to catch up <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> This was the case with Somali refugees at some primary schools in Nairobi.|$|E

25|$|Children {{also take}} {{initiative}} {{to help others}} in the classroom. It has been observed that when children are working in a group <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> and face difficulty, they will scan the room for an adult to assist or turn to their close fellows to either ask for help. Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found {{to take the initiative}} to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, homework, and caring for younger siblings.|$|E

Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, which is relatively open and state-oriented. The Malaysian economy is highly robust and diversified with the export value of high-tech products in 2015 standing at 57.258 billion USD, the second highest after Singapore in ASEAN. Malaysia exports the second largest volume and value of palm oil products globally after Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Birmingham {{established}} a structured network of neighborhood associations and community advisory committees to insure public participation in governmental {{issues that affect}} neighborhoods. Neighborhood associations are routinely consulted on matters related to zoning changes, liquor licenses, economic development, policing and other city services. Neighborhoods are also granted discretionary funds from the city's budget to use for capital improvements. Each neighborhood's officers meet <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> to form Community Advisory Committees which are granted broader powers over city departments. The presidents of these committees, in turn, form the Citizen's Advisory Board, which meets regularly with the mayor, council, and department heads. Birmingham is divided into a total of 23 communities, and again into a total of 99 individual neighborhoods with individual neighborhood associations.|$|E

The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E
500|$|Marine {{biologist}} Ronald J. Schusterman and {{his research}} associates have studied sea lions' cognitive ability. They {{have discovered that}} sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers,</b> rather than only the stimuli's common features. Sea lions have demonstrated the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language. However, the sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically.

500|$|As a child, Asperger {{appears to}} have {{exhibited}} some features of the very condition named after him, such as remoteness and talent in language. In 1944, Asperger described four children in his practice who had difficulty in integrating themselves socially. The children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers,</b> and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition [...] "autistic psychopathy" [...] and described it as primarily marked by social isolation. Fifty years later, several standardizations of AS as a diagnosis were tentatively proposed, many of which diverge significantly from Asperger's original work.|$|E
500|$|The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 {{produced}} a powerful echo within the city; {{there was a}} real possibility that demonstrations by students sympathizing <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> across the border could escalate into an uprising. The protests provided the Romanian authorities with a pretext to speed up the process of [...] "unification" [...] of the local Babeș (Romanian) and Bolyai (Hungarian) universities, allegedly contemplated before the 1956 events. Hungarians remained the majority of the city's population until the 1960s. [...] Then Romanians began to outnumber Hungarians, due to the population increase {{as a result of the}} government's forced industrialisation of the city and new jobs. During the Communist period, the city recorded a high industrial development, as well as enforced construction expansion. On 16 October 1974, when the city celebrated 1850 years since its first mention as Napoca, the Communist government changed the name of the city by adding [...] "Napoca" [...] to it.|$|E
500|$|Although Birtwistle and Davies {{wished to}} remain true to {{the tone and}} spirit of the novel, they wanted to produce [...] "a fresh, lively story about real people", not an [...] "old studio-bound BBC drama that was shown in the Sunday teatime slot". Emphasising sex and money as the themes of the story, Davies shifted the focus from Elizabeth to Elizabeth and Darcy and foreshadowed Darcy's role in the {{narrative}} resolution. To portray the characters as real human beings, Davies added short backstage scenes such as the Bennet girls dressing up to advertise themselves in the marriage market. New scenes where men pursue their hobbies <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> departed from Jane Austen's focus on women. The biggest technical difficulty proved to be adapting the long letters {{in the second half}} of the story. Davies employed techniques such as voice-overs, flashbacks, and having the characters read the letters to themselves and to each other. Davies added some dialogue to clarify events from the novel to a modern audience but left much of the novel's dialogue intact.|$|E
