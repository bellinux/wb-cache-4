40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{transfer of}} non-indigenous invasive aquatic organisms via ships' ballast water and shellfish translocation {{has been widely}} shown to cause significant ecological, economic and human health impacts. In 2004 the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments.

40|$|One {{proposed}} {{solution to the}} problem of ballast-mediated aquatic invasions involves chemically treating ballast water to kill key target organisms. Here, we examine the efficacy of three commercially available ballast <b>water</b> <b>biocides</b> using vegetative microalgae, dinoflagellate resting cysts and bacteria as test organisms. Chemicals tested were the ballast <b>water</b> <b>biocides</b> SeaKleen® and Peraclean® Ocean, and the chlorine dioxide biocide Vibrex®. Results demonstrate that the applicability of each of the three chemical biocides as a routine ballast water treatment is limited by factors such as cost, biological effectiveness and possible residual toxicity of the discharged ballast water (assessed on the basis of impact on motility of vegetative marine microalgae). Of the three biocides tested, Peraclean® Ocean appears to hold the most potential; however its effectiveness in shipboard trials is yet to be proven. Peraclean® Ocean was biodegradable within 2 - 6 weeks (initial concentration of 200 ppm), could effectively inactivate resting cysts of the marine dinoflagellates Gymnodinium catenatum, Alexandrium catenella and Protoceratium reticulatum at 400 ppm, could control bacterial growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua and Vibrio alginolyticus at 125 - 250 ppm, and could eliminate vegetative dinoflagellate cells at a concentration of 100 ppm. SeaKleen® eliminated vegetative microalgae at 2 ppm and could control resting cysts of the dinoflagellates G. catenatum and P. reticulatum at a concentration of 6 and 10 ppm, respectively, when exposed for a period of 2 weeks. SeaKleen® did not inactivate resting cysts of A. catenella at a concentration of 10 ppm and was found to degrade at a rate that could result in the discharge of residual toxic water into the marine environment. Together with the poor bactericidal properties of SeaKleen® (100 - 200 ppm required), this may limit the use of this biocide as a routine treatment option. Vibrex® is not a suitable ballast water treatment option due to the need for hydrochloric acid as an activator, however it was found to be the most effective against bacteria (complete inhibition at 15 ppm) indicating that onboard chlorine dioxide generators may provide an effective bacterial treatment option. The performance of these biocides was adversely influenced by a variety of factors including low water temperatures (6 °C compared to 17 °C), light versus dark conditions, and the presence of humus-rich seawater and ballast water sediments...|$|R

40|$|Waste {{water is}} {{generated}} in the batch production process of water-based paints when vessels and filling lines are washed between batches. This results in a diluted paint wash water stream. The wash water is currently treated in a flocculation process using ferric chloride as a coagulant. An opportunity was identified for re-using wash water from white, non-textured paints. It is necessary to stabilise the wash <b>water</b> with <b>biocides.</b> This <b>water</b> is then used in place of fresh feed water for lower quality paints. Since the wash water originates from high quality products, adding this water to the lower quality paints results in a quality improvement. In addition, treatment costs of the wash water are reduced. This wash water represents approximately 65 % of total effluent from the plant. With respect to {{the remainder of the}} wash water, the concentration of paint solids in the wastewater stream can vary widely. For effective treatment different solids content in the waste water requires different dosage levels of the coagulant. If ferric chloride is used as the coagulant overdosing results in waste that must be disposed of as toxic. Ferric chloride dosing can be more easily controlled by using a dilute feed solution. This paper presents the findings of the effect of concentration of the coagulant on the coagulation process.

40|$|Illness {{caused by}} the gram-negative {{bacteria}} in the genus Legionella {{is referred to as}} legionellosis. Legionellosis consists of two distinct clinical syndromes, Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever. Legionnaires' disease is characterized by pneumonia wherase Pontiac fever is a self-limiting, nonpneumonic, influenza-like illness. Inhalation of aerosols containing the bacterium is presumed to be the primary means of acquiring legionellosis. Aerosolized waters from cooling towers, evaporative condensers, showers, and humidifiers have been identified as sources of infection. Legionella species have been recovered {{from a wide variety of}} domestic water systems and are ubiquitous in freshwater environments. Although once considered transient contaminants of natural and domestic waters, legionellae are now known to be free-living organisms surviving as natural components of freshwater ecosystems. Domestic systems are complex environments in which concentrations of legionellae can fluctuate considerably depending upon <b>water</b> temperature, <b>biocide</b> levels, and presence of natural hosts (i. e. protozoa) for legionellae to parasitize. The choice of procedure used to recover legionellae from water samples is dependant upon the expected degree of bacterial contamination in a particular water source. Potable waters generally have low bacterial densities and are either cultured directly or concentrated to detect legionellae. Nonpotable waters, such as those from cooling towers, generally do not require concentration because of their high bacterial concentrations.

40|$|Formation of fouling {{deposits}} is {{a serious}} problem facing paper mills. Despite the search for alternative methods, chemical biocides still represent the chief countermeasure to control microbial growth and general fouling buid-up in pulp and paper mills. The purpose of this work was to determine the effect of two biocides (carbamate and glutaraldehyde) on both planktonic cells and fouling layers of a paper machine system. A flow system was used for the study of fouling accumulation in an industrial white <b>water</b> circuit. Both <b>biocides</b> proved to be more effective in reducing the microbial loading of the white water circuit than the deposit accumulated on the stainless steel surfaces. Carbamate, in contrast to glutaraldehyde, had the ability of promoting cell agglomeration since the microbial loading decreased much more when the white water, treated with carbamate, was filtered through a filter-linen. The retention of suspended cells in the cellulose fibres acquires major importance since it is obtained by using an already existing physical process (filtration), which strongly enhances the overall microbial reduction obtained with the addition of the carbamate, without increasing the economic costs. These results also suggest that the use of conventional retention agents in pulp and paper processes can be efficient in controlling unwanted microbial effects.

As some of these compounds are harmful to health, stringent limits have been imposed by regulatory bodies on their permissible levels in potable <b>water.</b> Several alternative <b>biocides</b> such as ozone, chloramine, chlorine dioxide, etc., {{had been used to}} reduce the THM levels in drinking water. Ozonation is becoming increasingly popular in Europe as well as in North America. Both ozone and chloramine are reported to produce low levels of THMs in surface water treatments. In seawater desalination, disinfection of seawater and product water is mostly carried out by chlorination and very few studies have been reported on the use of alternative disinfectants in this field. Water samples from seawater desalination differs from those originating from natural sources such as rivers and lakes in one important aspect which is relevant to THM formation, i. e., its bromide content. High bromide content in seawater and possibility of carry over of bromine and brominated THMs into the desalinated water may alter both the quantity and species distribution of THMs. This paper describes the results of a detailed comparative study on the formation of THMs by three disinfectants, i. e., chlorine, ozone and chloramine in synthetic water samples containing Cl-, Br- and humic acid (HA) and in samples of seawater and distillates from MSF plants and well water used for blending purpose.

40|$|Marine {{biofouling}} can {{be defined}} as the colonization of man-made surfaces in seawater by microscopic and macroscopic organisms. This phenomenon can result in great loss of function and effectiveness both for cruising ships and for static constructions. Of special concern are the negative effects of hard fouler such as barnacles, which cause increased drag resistance resulting in increases in fuel consumption, and disruption of the corrosion protective layer of marine vessels and constructions. Present biocide-based antifouling strategies are based on a continuous exposure of biocides at the film/water interface and consequently release into the environment if the antifouling efficacy is to be maintained. Such biocide-based solutions can therefore not be regarded as sustainable. The aim of this thesis is to describe the possibility to design biocide antifouling coatings based on a new strategy. Instead of releasing the bioactive molecule to the bulk <b>water</b> the <b>biocide</b> will be “entrapped” in the paint matrix and only after stimuli by organism interaction with the paint surface intoxication will take place. It was shown (Paper I) that using an experimental formulation, containing ivermectin, both in static panels and on boats, long lasting protection against barnacles was obtained. Moreover, using two model surfaces (Paper II), it was possible to separate and study the different contributions to the antifouling efficacy, finding that the low leaching of ivermectin had no contribution at all while surface’s modulus of the coating was the key factor. This supports the validity of the contact active antifouling hypothesis, rather than emission based. In (Paper III) we could follow the fate of barnacle growing on ivermectin containing coatings, and both field and laboratory tests could demonstrate that the intoxication of barnacles start when the juvenile organism reach ca. 0. 6 - 0. 7 mm in diameter. Electronic microscopy images on the panels after the test, demonstrate that on control paint (no biocide) the juvenile barnacles (0. 6 - 0. 7 mm diameter) already leaves imprint or penetration marks on the rosin based coatings. The distribution of ivermectin in the dry film seemed to be related with enhancement of barnacles contact intoxication. This was studied by fluorescence microscopy in (Paper I) and by the use ToF-SIMS in (Paper IV). This particular analytic method gives the possibility to follow organic biocides in paint film without the need of labelling or modify the biocide molecule in any extent. The entrapped antifouling strategy opens up the possibility to achieve long term antifouling (> 10 years) as {{there is no need to}} use erosive binders. Moreover, this system might also find it uses in marine constructions and other fields where maintenance is difficult...|$|R

This major policy pronouncement, qualified Irish potato for government initiated farmer support initiatives such as mechanisation and irrigation capacity building. The growing importance of potato as a food crop is prefaced on rising food insecurity in the country coupled with the impact of the radical land reform of 2000 on agricultural production. The land reform completely restructured commercial agriculture when about 96 % of the original 12. 5 million ha of large-scale commercial farmland in 1980 was taken up for resettlement by 2010. Two resettlement models were used, the A 1 and A 2 resettlement models. The former resembles the communal area land allocation system while the later are self-contained small to medium scale farm units ranging about 35 to 300 ha. The newly resettled farmers have started growing potato adding to the already existing communal area and the few remaining large-scale commercial farmers. It is in this context that the potential of the new agrarian structure to sustainably increase Irish potato production was investigated. Increasing potato production on a sustainable basis will enable the crop to assert itself as a national strategic food security crop and help ease the food security challenges the country is grappling with. A grower survey was conducted on the cultural practices, input use, average yield, and infrastructure for potato production. The survey data was used to categorise the growers. Only growers with a minimum 5 years continuous potato growing experience were targeted making the data collected dependable. Grower resource footprints of land, <b>water,</b> <b>biocides</b> and nutrients were calculated based on the actual yield, Ya. Further, the Ya data collected were used to calculate the yield gap, YG, based on the yield of the best performing growers, Yh, simulated yield potential, Yp, and water-limited potential yield, Yw, of the respective agro-ecological areas. The LINTUL-POTATO model was used to estimate Yp, Yw and water need. This model simulates potential dry matter production based on radiation use efficiency of intercepted light by the potato crop. Another model, the Cool Farm Tool-Potato was used to further distinguish and appraise the production systems in terms of yields, inputs and efficient use of energy as reflected in their CO 2 balances. The model calculates the contributions of various production operations to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Consequently, grower practices which contribute the most to the GHG emission were identified and generic mitigation measures for each production system were suggested. Realising the growing importance of sustainability issues in agricultural production and the scarcity of evaluation protocols in cropping systems, the study developed a framework {{that can be used to}} evaluate cropping systems. The framework was constructed using the potato-based cropping systems in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. Finally, instead of just focusing on the production related aspects only, the study also took into cognisance the need to understand the performance of the entire Irish potato sector in Zimbabwe. A value-chain analysis was therefore conducted to evaluate the performance the Irish potato sector in the country. Irish potato production in Zimbabwe is still low. Experts estimate annual production at nearly 120, 000 t from around 6, 000 ha. The large-scale commercial and the A 2 resettlement are large-scale, high input and mechanised systems with an average potato area of 9 ha per planting. The communal area and A 1 resettlement are smallholder low input systems with average potato area per planting of 0. 8 ha and animal-drawn equipment is used. On resource use efficiencies, the actual tuber yield ranged from 8 – 35 t/ha across all systems representing a yield gap of over 77 %. Comparing with the simulated average potential yield, the mean actual yield observed ranged from 8 to 35 % of the simulated potential yield, translating to a yield gap of 65 to 92 %. Hence there is a large potential to increase potato production in these environments. The nutrient use efficiencies range were: 97 to 162 g potato g- 1 N, 93 – 105 g potato g- 1 P 2 O 5 and 97 – 123 g potato g- 1 K 2 O. This was anticipated because of the high synthetic fertiliser use and the low actual yields reported. The biocide use efficiencies ranged from 0. 5 to 0. 9 kg potato g- 1 active ingredient (a. i.) fungicide, and 8 to 15 kg potato g- 1 a. i. insecticide. Regarding water use, the average water use efficiency based on irrigation water and rainfall, ranged from 2 to 6 g potato l- 1, while the simulated potential water use efficiency from irrigation and precipitation ranged from 9 to 17 g potato l- 1. The large gap observed between actual and potential water use efficiency shows the scope to improve crop management practices to increase actual yield while lowering irrigation water. On the CO 2 balance of the systems, a high carbon footprint was reported with an average of 251 kg CO 2 eq. /t potato. The least average carbon footprint was 216 kg CO 2 eq. /t potato for the communal area, while the A 2 resettlement system had the highest of 286 kg CO 2 eq. /t potato. The high carbon footprint was anticipated as a reflection of the systems’ inefficiencies in terms of low yields and high input use. Focussing on the performance of the entire Irish potato sector, value chain analysis showed considerable levels of value-addition and gross profit of at least 13 % at each linkage. While the sector enjoys government policy support, major factors impacting on the value-chain performance relate to high potato production costs, low yields, and lack of farmer training. On the proposed framework on cropping sustainability, the indicator thresholds serve to monitor farmer progress as they improve their practices towards the desired direction of sustainability. This study demonstrated that there is tremendous potential to increase potato output and help ease the food insecurity challenges the country currently faces.    ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{seawater}} in cooling {{systems is}} a common practice {{in many parts of}} the world where there is a shortage of freshwater. However, biofouling is one of the major operational problems associated with the usage of seawater in cooling systems. Microfouling is caused by the activities of microorganisms, such as bacteria and algae, producing a very thin layer that sticks to the inside surface of the tubes in heat exchangers. This thin layer has a tremendously negative impact on heat transferred across the heat exchanger tubes in the system. In some instances, even a 250 micrometer thickness of fouling film can reduce the heat exchanger's heat transfer coefficient by 50 percent. On the other hand, macrofouling is the blockage caused by relatively large marine organisms, such as oysters, mussels, clams, and barnacles. A biocide is typically added to eliminate, or at least reduce, biofouling. Typically, microfouling can be controlled by intermittent dosages, and macrofouling can be controlled by continuous dosages of biocide. The aim of this research work is to develop a systematic approach to the optimal operating and design alternatives for integrated seawater cooling systems in industrial facilities. A process integration framework is used to provide a holistic approach to optimizing the design and operation of the seawater cooling system, along with the dosage and discharge systems. Optimization formulations are employed to systematize the decision-making and to reconcile the various economic, technical, and environmental aspects of the problem. Building blocks of the approach include the <b>biocide</b> <b>water</b> chemistry and kinetics, process cooling requirements, dosage scenarios and dynamic profiles, biofilm growth, seawater discharge, and environmental regulations. Seawater chemistry is studied with emphasis on the usage of biocide for seawater cooling. A multi-period optimization formulation is developed and solved to determine: * The optimal levels of dosing and dechlorination chemicals * The timing of maintenance to clean the heat-exchange * The dynamic dependence of the biofilm growth on the applied doses, the seawater-biocide chemistry, the process conditions, and seawater characteristics for each time period. The technical, economic, and environmental considerations of the system are accounted for and discussed through case studies...|$|R
40|$|The article {{acknowledges}} {{the formation of}} bacterial biofilms in strains of bacteria species Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae when grown in liquid media {{under the influence of}} negative factors (chemical factor) — containing agents. Biofilms, as a community of microorganisms cause many chronic infections (meningitis, inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity, urogenital infections) and create problems in the industry (fouling of processing equipment, ship hulls, oil platforms, biocorrosion metal products). Ordinary disinfectants, such as chlorine and sodium chlorite, can not remove the biofilm, so finding an effective means of dealing with them is enough actual problem. Various antibacterial agents are ineffective in combating biofilms, since bacteria produce large amounts of polysaccharides — substances that help the colony stay without disintegration. Polysaccharide serves as a barrier layer for substances in <b>water,</b> including for <b>biocides.</b> This is the main reason for the survival of microorganisms even in the heavily chlorinated water. In the study the latest data took into account on the subject, especially concerning adverse effects of oxygen on the growth of bacterial cells and directs action as a factor in the formation of biofilms. In our study we analyzed the latest generation disinfectant as an influencing factor. Working concentrations were shown in three embodiments. The number of strains studied was 6 (3 strains of each species). All strains were obtained from the Department of Museum MVE and VSE Ulyanovsk State Agricultural Academy n. a. P. A. Stolypin. In our research the biofilm community formation phenomenon has been confirmed, marked differences in biofilm formation, depending on the intensity (in this case, concentration) of the promoter and bacteria species. In vivo biofilm is easily destroyed by mechanical action (shaking test tubes with the medium). Biofilm recovery after this manipulation was not observed. The results of further studies on solid medium (meatpeptone agar) and the color smear simple dye (Gram) into the death of the bacterial cells have not been confirmed. In all cases, bacterial growth was observed, characteristic of these types of bacteria. The studies were conducted in 2015 {{on the basis of the}} Research Innovation Center of Microbiology and Biotechnology (Ulyanovsk) and with the financial support of the Foundation for Assistance to Small Innovative Enterprises in the scientific and technical sphere.   </p...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The {{increasing}} demand for water in South Africa arises from a {{rapid population growth}} and supporting industrial development. This demand has to be met from limited water resources that are shared by competing user groups and neighbouring states. Deteriorating water quality further limits the sustainable use of water through point and diffuse source pollution of macro constituents, metals and biocides. Metals in the environment can originate as point sources, including industrial and mining effluent, or diffuse sources from geological origin, agricultural activities, acid mine draining and leachate from dumps. Biocides increase crop yields, protect forests and control vectors of serious human disease, but {{are in the process}} also carried to water courses. Bioaccumulation studies have been identified as a method to monitor pollutants in the environment. The analyses of data from bioaccumulation studies share a common problem in having to deal with many independent variables, for example variations in time and space, environmental conditions and biological parameters. The objectives of this study were to; investigate the metal levels in water and metal and biocide bioaccumulation in fish tissues from the Berg, Luvuvhu, Olifants and Sabie Rivers; develop a procedure to predict areas and biocides at risk of causing diffuse source pollution and; evaluate the available data and procedures to propose more efficient and cost effective bioaccumulation programmes. The investigation evaluated current and potential contamination of the selected catchments and identified research needs. Fish tissues and water grab samples were collected in the Berg, Luvuvhu, Olifants and Sabie Rivers. The samples were tested for physical variables and analysed for macro constituents and metal levels according to standard analytical procedures. Fish were caught (gill and seine nets) and larger specimens were selected for tissue analyses. Species were identified and standard length, mass, gender, gonadotrophic development index and age indicators were collected. Standard procedures were used to analyse fish tissues for metal levels with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) and biocide levels with gas chromatographic methods. A flow diagram of a statistical methodology was developed to incorporate the effects of all biological parameters in the analyses of bioaccumulation data. The procedures used to calculate human health risks are that of the Risk Assistant package reviewed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A Geographical Information System (GIS) model was developed, incorporating the factors affecting runoff of surface <b>water</b> and <b>biocides,</b> to predict areas and variables that could cause diffuse source pollution. The pH values of the rivers studied ranged from of 7. 2 to 8. 7 except for the Klipspruit River before its confluence with the Olifants River that had a pH of 4. 8. Nutrient levels in the Berg River are within the South African guidelines. Nutrients in the Luvuvhu River mostly exceed the guideline values for ortho-phosphate, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus. In the Olifants River the values for ortho-phosphate, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen and nitrate and nitrite nitrogen often exceed the South African guideline values. Nutrients in the Sabie River have low concentrations with only ammonia nitrogen exceeding the guideline values. TDS values in the Olifants River is the highest, which is an indication of the high salt loads in the river. The concentrations of various metals in water from the Berg, Luvuvhu, Sabie and Olifants Rivers exceeded the proposed South African and international guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Irish potato is {{the third}} most {{important}} carbohydrate food crop in Zimbabwe after maize and wheat. In 2012, the Government of Zimbabwe declared it a strategic national food security crop. In this study, we examine the country's potential for increasing Irish potato yield and help ease the nation's food security challenges. The magnitude of food production increase on already existing croplands depends on {{the difference between the}} current actual yields and the potential yield of the crop in the given agro-ecological environment, also called the yield gap. We used three already well-understood types of yield gap: (1) the gap between actual farmer yields, Ya, and the maximum (potential) yield, Yp, achieved when a crop is grown under conditions of non-limiting water and nutrient supply with biotic stress effectively controlled; (2) the gap between Ya and the water-limited yield, Yw, which is the maximum yield attainable under rainfed systems; and (3) the gap between Ya, and the highest yield, Yh, achieved by the best farmers in an agro-ecological area. A grower survey was conducted on the different potato production systems in the country in order to establish the actual yields and input application rates used in potato production. The actual potato yields were used to calculate efficiencies of natural and synthetic resources use. Potential and water-limited yields, and planting times of potato were established for the different agro-ecological regions using the LINTUL-POTATO model, a model based on interception and utilisation of incoming solar radiation. The mean actual yield observed ranged from 8 to 35 % of the potential yield, translating to a yield gap of 65 to 92 %, hence there is a huge potential to increase production. Simulated potential water use efficiency based on evapotranspiration range was 19 – 27 g potato/l against the actual water use efficiency of 2 – 6 g potato/l based on irrigation and rainfall. The current high fertiliser application rates and low actual yields we report, suggest inefficient fertiliser use in potato production in Zimbabwe. The average actual fungicide and insecticide use efficiencies were 0. 7 and 13 kg potato/g active ingredient, respectively, across all production systems. All sampled growers lacked knowledge on integrated pest management, a concept which could possibly improve the biocide use efficiency through lowering biocide application rates while maintaining or even improving yields. Our analysis suggests that there is opportunity to improve <b>water,</b> nutrients and <b>biocides</b> resource use efficiencies and increase potato actual yields in Zimbabwe...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{associated}} {{infections are}} responsible for substantial patient morbidity, mortality and economic cost. Infection control strategies for reducing rates of transmission {{include the use of}} nonwoven wipes, with or without a biocidal liquid, to remove pathogenic bacteria from frequently touched surfaces. Considerable research has been conducted on the role of biocides in disrupting microbes such as bacteria, but less is known about the influence of wiping surfaces with nonwovens regarding their removal. This research considers the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the removal of bacterial contamination from model healthcare surfaces. The extent to which systematic changes in wipe fibre surface energy and nano-roughness influence removal of bacteria from a polymer surface in dry wiping conditions was studied. Nonwoven wipe substrates composed of two commonly used fibre types, lyocell (cellulose II) and polypropylene (PP), with different surface energies and nano-roughnesses, were experimentally manufactured. The surface energy and nano-roughness of lyocell substrates were modified by either oxygen or hexafluoroethane plasma treatment. Static wiping of an inoculated surface under dry conditions produced bacterial removal efficiencies of between 9. 4 colony forming unit (CFU) % and 15. 7 CFU % versus control, with no significant difference (p 50 CFU % versus static wiping (p < 0. 05), depending on fibre type and bacterium. Under dynamic wiping conditions, nonwoven wipe substrates with a surface energy closest to that of the contaminated surface produced the highest E. coli removal efficiency, while the associated increase in fibre nano-roughness abrogated this trend with S. aureus and E. faecalis. Considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors of wiping and design factors on the removal of pathogenic bacteria, the single most important parameter affecting bacterial removal efficiency was impregnation with biocidal liquid (p < 0. 05). However, dynamic wiping in the dry state and with <b>water</b> alone without <b>biocide</b> still resulted in substantial removal. Bacterial removal was therefore not conditional on the presence of a biocide. For 100 % lyocell wipes impregnated with biocidal liquid, removal of E. coli, S. aureus and E. faecalis improved by increasing the fabric basis weight and hand weight wiping pressure to their maximal values (150 g. m- 2 and 13. 80 kN. m- 2 respectively). For 100 % polypropylene wipes, the same conditions maximised the removal efficiency of S. aureus. For E. coli and E. faecalis, a reduction in the hand weight wiping pressure to 4. 68 kN. m- 2 was required to maximise the removal efficiency with 100 % polypropylene. Generally, the lyocell wipes were more effective in removing bacterial contamination than 100 % polypropylene wipes. The removal and destruction of pathogenic bacteria partly by wiping relies on their transfer to fibre surfaces within the wipe. The extent to which the surface properties influences specific bacterial removal was investigated in terms of polymer composition and surface roughness, as well any residual antimicrobial activity conferred to the surface by the biocide. It was determined that {{there was no significant difference}} in removal of E. coli, S. aureus and E. faecalis from plastic, ceramic or metal surfaces by either 100 % lyocell or 100 % polypropylene nonwoven wipes (p < 0. 05) during wet wiping. No significant residual antimicrobial activity was seen form the biocide deposited on clinical surfaces after wiping (p < 0. 05). Therefore, regular disinfection of clinical surfaces, with a “one wipe, one surface” policy should be implemented...|$|R
