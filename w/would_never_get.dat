And that this must go on eternally, unless a Christian man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only then will they stay dead. Freyja agreed.|$|E

25|$|Tsvetaeva's two half-siblings, Valeria and Andrei, {{were the}} {{children}} of Ivan's deceased first wife, Varvara Dmitrievna Ilovaiskaya, daughter of the historian Dmitry Ilovaisky. Tsvetaeva's only full sister, Anastasia, was born in 1894. The children quarrelled frequently and occasionally violently. There was considerable tension between Tsvetaeva's mother and Varvara's children, and Tsvetaeva's father maintained close contact with Varvara's family. Tsvetaeva's father was kind, but deeply wrapped up in his studies and distant from his family. He was also still deeply {{in love with his}} first wife; he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> over her. Maria Tsvetaeva had had a love affair before her marriage, from which she never recovered. Maria Tsvetaeva disapproved of Marina's poetic inclination; she wanted her daughter to become a pianist, holding the opinion that her poetry was poor.|$|E
25|$|The young Kaiser Wilhelm sought {{aggressively to}} {{increase}} Germany's {{influence in the}} world (Weltpolitik). After the removal of Bismarck, foreign policy was {{in the hands of}} the erratic Kaiser, who played an increasingly reckless hand, and the powerful foreign office under the leadership of Friedrich von Holstein. The foreign office argued that: first, a long-term coalition between France and Russia had to fall apart; secondly, Russia and Britain <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> together; and, finally, Britain would eventually seek an alliance with Germany. Germany refused to renew its treaties with Russia. But Russia did form a closer relationship with France in the Dual Alliance of 1894, since both were worried about the possibilities of German aggression. Furthermore, Anglo–German relations cooled as Germany aggressively tried to build a new empire and engaged in a naval race with Britain; London refused to agree to the formal alliance that Germany sought. Berlin's analysis proved mistaken on every point, leading to Germany's increasing isolation and its dependence on the Triple Alliance, which brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was undermined by differences between Austria and Italy, and in 1915 Italy switched sides.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{returned}} on the January 3, 2013, {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, saving Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe from Aces & Eights before beating the group {{down with a}} baseball bat. Sting wrestled his return match the following week, defeating Aces & Eights member Mike Knox after he injured Kurt Angle. Three days later at Genesis, Sting gained his revenge on DOC by defeating him in a singles match. On the February 7 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting teamed up with Bully Ray to defeat Devon and DOC in a Tables match. On March 10 at Lockdown, Team TNA, consisting of Sting, Eric Young, James Storm, Magnus, and Samoa Joe defeated Aces & Eights, consisting of Devon, DOC, Garett Bischoff, Mike Knox, and Mr. Anderson in a Lethal Lockdown match. After Bully Ray won the World Heavyweight Championship and revealed himself {{as the leader of}} Aces & Eights later that night, Hulk Hogan blamed Sting as he had encouraged Hogan to give Ray the title shot while also encouraging Hogan to support Ray's marriage with his daughter Brooke. Sting proceeded to walk out on Hogan. Sting returned on the April 25 Impact Wrestling, saving Hogan from an attack by the Aces & Eights. The following week, Sting reconciled with Hogan and became the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship later that night after defeating Matt Morgan. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Bully Ray for the World Heavyweight Championship in a No Holds Barred Match after an interference by Aces & Eights.

500|$|Harrison's {{commitment}} to overseeing {{the release of}} the Concert for Bangladesh documentary film prevented him from being able to start on the follow-up to his All Things Must Pass triple album until midway through 1972. Another delay was caused by producer Phil Spector's unreliability, as Harrison waited for him to turn up {{for the start of the}} sessions. Author Bruce Spizer writes that [...] "the eccentric producer's erratic attendance caused George to realize the project <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> done if he kept waiting for Spector", and by October that year, Harrison had decided to produce the album alone.|$|E
500|$|The {{consensus}} on Ramsey's playing style among his fellow professionals {{was that he}} was rather slow, but possessed an excellent positional sense, read the game better than most, and distributed the ball exceptionally well for a defender. Taking after his Southampton captain Bill Rochford, he preferred to play the ball out of defence rather than simply clearing it as quickly as possible. He became a specialist penalty taker due to his coolness and ability to anticipate the goalkeeper. Ted Bates, one of Ramsey's Southampton teammates, described him as [...] "lacking both height and speed", but credited him with a [...] "razor-sharp brain... he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> into a situation that exposed him".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{controversy}} surrounding the game, it was approved for release in Germany and Australia, countries that are known to ban explicit video games. Producer John Williamson stated in an interview, [...] "I thought, just based on everything I always read online, that it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> through, but it went through on the first pass." [...] Williamson attempted to justify {{the release of the}} game by noting the intellectual elements of both the game and the film franchise. He pointed out: I think they reviewed the game based on everything that was in it, not just on a couple of minutes of it, just like the Saw movies themselves aren't really pure torture porn. If you pay attention, there's actually usually a big twist in them. He went on to comment that the Saw films would not continue to appeal to fans if they were stereotypical torture porn.|$|E

500|$|Falk {{felt that}} virtual reality {{undermined}} the show's [...] "strong connection to reality", {{and suggested that}} after so many dangerous incidents Dr. Quest would have turned the system off. Writers brought back several classic characters, including Pasha the Peddler, Jezebel Jade, Dr. Zin and his twin daughters, Anaya and Melana,. Falk honored Quest creator Doug Wildey by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny in the episode [...] "Nuclear Netherworld", as well as homage to William Hanna's birthstate of New Mexico where Jonny's grandfather resides. The team created Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to retcon the telefilms, feeling that Jade <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> married. Writers eventually killed off villains Ezekiel Rage and Dr. Jeremiah Surd in favor of new adversaries. Comparing Quest without Zin to [...] "James Bond without S.P.E.C.T.R.E.", Falk penned a season finale featuring classic robot spies and a visceral fight between Dr. Quest and Zin. Falk planned to resuscitate Palm Key as the Quest home in new episodes. Cartoon Network did not renew Real Adventures, despite a pledge to explore the history of Jonny's mother Rachel in the season premiere.|$|E
500|$|Smythe also envisioned {{building}} a new shrine for his team. He described it as [...] "a place where people can go in evening clothes, {{if they want to}} come there for a party or dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton's department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> the arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. [...] They referred to the arena plan as [...] "Smythe's Folly". [...] To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4½ months after breaking ground, Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. [...] In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it."

500|$|Although his {{official}} job title {{was as a}} composer, Mitsuda found himself working more as a sound engineer. Over the next two years, he created sound effects for , Final Fantasy V, The 7th Saga, Secret of Mana, and Romancing SaGa 2. In 1994, realizing that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> a chance to move up to a real composition duty without some drastic action and feeling concerned about his low pay, he gave Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, an ultimatum: let him compose, or he would quit. Sakaguchi assigned the young musician to the team working on Chrono Trigger, telling him that [...] "after you finish it, maybe your salary will go up". Mitsuda was assigned as the sole composer for the game, in the end creating 54 tracks for the final release. Mitsuda drove himself to work hard on the score, frequently working until he passed out, and would awake with ideas for songs such as the ending theme for the game. He worked himself so hard that he developed stomach ulcers {{and had to be}} hospitalized, which led Uematsu to finish the remaining tracks for him.|$|E
500|$|The comic book's initial cancellation, and the {{introduction}} of the character to DC led to many negative feedback and reception. I, Vampire writer Joshua Hale Fialkov expressed sadness he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> to write [...] "the 'real' John Constantine", noted crime author and former Hellblazer writer Ian Rankin stated that Constantine was the only comic book character he ever wanted to write for, and Alan Moore's daughter, Leah Moore expressing doubt that Constantine could replace Hellblazer, among others. As a result, DC co-publisher Dan Didio issued a statement defending this decision, stating that, [...] "Hellblazer's had a long and incredibly successful run and that's a tip of the hat to all the great creators that have worked on the book over the years. The new Constantine series will return him back to his roots in the DCU and hopefully be the start of another incredible run." [...] Comic Alliance described Hellblazer's cancellation as marking [...] "the end of an era for Vertigo" [...] while adding it to be [...] "one of a handful of comics from the late eighties that helped comic books and their readers grow up." ...|$|E
500|$|Licciardello {{stated that}} they did not know they had entered the red zone, and [...] "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone.

[...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E

She also noted that Marvel had now lost [...] "the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, {{not the least of which}} is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and added that despite making [...] "leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [...] be said for people of color," [...] wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like Hazel Ying Lee, one of 38 Women Airforce Service Pilots who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the United States Naval Reserve.|$|E
500|$|Following post-production, the {{programme}} was shelved by ITV Network Centre until 1997, when it {{was placed}} on the Easter weekend schedule as part of the network's [...] "Comedy Premieres" [...] programming strand.

Also broadcast on 30 March was ITV's coverage of the Brazilian Grand Prix. The race was restarted due to an accident and threw ITV's evening schedules into disarray. Broadcast of Cold Feet eventually began 40 minutes later than originally advertised and the overnight ratings reflected this; it recorded viewing figures of just 3.5million. Harries wrote it off as a failure, telling Langan that they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> a series. Some critical success came though; writing in The Times the day after it aired, Matthew Bond called it [...] "an enjoyable one-off comedy aimed at anybody who's ever been single, married, or had children. With such catholic appeal further heightened by Helen Baxendale heading a talented cast, it showed just what ITV can do when it is trying to win awards, such as the Golden Rose of Montreux." [...] The Suns Tim Ewbank echoed Bond's reaction, expressing surprise that a [...] "fast, funny, convincing" [...] comedy had appeared on ITV, calling it [...] "a treat" [...] and [...] "sharply observed", and Baxendale and Nesbitt [...] "terrific".|$|E
