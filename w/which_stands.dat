5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon.

5|$|The First World War {{memorial}} in Grove Park, containing a sculpture by Alfred Drury, was unveiled in 1922, with additions by Walter Cave for the Second World War.

The square-shaped throne is entirely inlaid with mother-of-pearl, dating from the reign of King Rama I. It was saved from the Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat, when the throne hall burnt down in 1789. The throne is topped by the Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his graduation, he ranked third in career tackles in school history, behind Anderson and Ron Simpkins. He has since been passed by Jarrett Irons and Sam Sword, and he stands fifth with 220 tackles. In terms of tackles and assists combined, Morrison once totaled 23 in a November 14, 1992 game against the Illinois Fighting Illini {{football}} team, <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> as a Michigan Football record for a game at Michigan Stadium. Morrison suffered compartmental syndrome in his calf, which necessitated surgical repair to stop internal bleeding, during his 1990 freshman season, for which he earned a medical redshirt season by the NCAA. As a sophomore (redshirt freshman), he sat out four games with a broken leg. In 1993, he missed the first seven games with a broken foot.|$|E

5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E

5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> for VOice SIMulator, {{is a system}} based on the digital sound synthesis of simple, sinusoidal square waves, allowing the modeling of vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of {{the symbols}} of Tiruchirappalli, the Rockfort is a {{fortress}} <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> atop a 273-foot-high rock. It consists {{of a set of}} monolithic rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The temple complex has three shrines, two of which are dedicated to Lord Ganesha, one at the foot and the Ucchi Pillayar Temple at the top, and the Thayumanavar Temple between them. The Thayumanavar temple, the largest of the three, houses a shrine for Pārvatī as well as the main deity. The Rockfort is visible from almost every part of the city's north. The Teppakulam {{at the foot of the}} Rockfort is surrounded by bazaars. It has a mandapa at its centre and has facilities for boat riding.|$|E
5|$|East Tilbury, <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> at {{the western}} end of the section of the Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements {{on both sides of the}} Thames were raided by the French in 1379 during the second phase of the Hundred Years' War. The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.|$|E

5|$|The Ogle County Courthouse is a National Register of Historic Places listing in the Ogle County, Illinois, {{county seat}} of Oregon. The {{building}} {{stands on a}} public square in the city's downtown commercial district. The current structure was completed in 1891 and was preceded by two other buildings, {{one of which was}} destroyed by a group of outlaws. Following the destruction of the courthouse, the county was without a judicial building for a period during the 1840s. The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The ridged roof is dominated by its wooden cupola <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> out at a distance.|$|E
5|$|The day of filming in the salvage yard, {{which took}} place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was {{abnormally}} hot according to Lauren Vélez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's victim is found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid—"all the things we needed it to be". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, and {{a house in a}} residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> in for Dexter's childhood home.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a Tuscan column of Purbeck Marble construction, on <b>which</b> <b>stands</b> a statue of Saint George slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture and approached several artists but all quotes she received would have exceeded the village's budget, so she instead commissioned a copy of a statue in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The column stands on a tall, narrow pedestal in Portland stone that bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by Robert Bridges, the poet laureate, in correspondence with Lady Horner.
