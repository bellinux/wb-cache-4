25|$|Chihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited or cold. Chihuahuas, {{especially}} the short coat variety, are less tolerant of cold than larger breeds, and require a sweater and/or boots in cold weather.

30|$|Studies of {{parenting}} typologies have traditionally adopted a two-dimensional framework (warmth or acceptance vs. control or strictness) with {{four types of}} parental socialisation style: authoritative (high <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and control), authoritarian (high in control but low <b>in</b> <b>warmth),</b> indulgent (high <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> but low <b>in</b> control) and neglectful (low <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and <b>in</b> control) (Baumrind, 1991; Maccoby & Martin, 1983; Steinberg, Blatt-Eisengart, & Cauffman, 2006).|$|R
30|$|To {{obtain the}} four {{categories}} of parenting styles, the mothers’ and fathers’ scores for warmth and control were dichotomised (high vs. low) by the median (García & Gracia, 2010; Lamborn, Mounts, Steinberg, & Dornbusch, 1991), such that parent’s scoring low <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and control {{were classified as}} neglectful; low <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and high <b>in</b> control as authoritarian; high <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and low <b>in</b> control as indulgent; and high <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and control as authoritative.|$|R
50|$|The {{stereotype}} content model (SCM) is {{a psychological}} theory that differentiates stereotypes among two dimensions: warmth and competence. Stereotyped groups can be evaluated in four combinations of <b>warmth</b> by competence <b>in</b> {{terms of being}} low or high on either trait. The combination of these dimensions will elicit different types of emotions from others. According to the SCM, mothers are stereotyped as high <b>in</b> <b>warmth,</b> but low <b>in</b> competence. Groups who are viewed as high <b>in</b> <b>warmth,</b> but low <b>in</b> competence elicit feelings of pity and a paternalistic response which may result in discrimination.|$|R
25|$|Temperamental and {{constitutional}} disposition is {{considered as a}} major factor in resilience. It is one of the necessary precursors of resilience along with <b>warmth</b> <b>in</b> family cohesion and accessibility of prosocial support systems. There are three kinds of temperamental systems that play part in resilience, they are the appetitive system, defensive system and attentional system.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its high}} {{altitude}} the city temperatures can reach temperatures below 0°C. Many homes burn firewood for <b>warmth</b> <b>in</b> cold weather.

25|$|Most {{houses in}} the rural {{lowlands}} of Nepal {{are made up of}} a tight bamboo framework and walls of a mud and cow-dung mix. These dwellings remain cool in summer and retain <b>warmth</b> <b>in</b> winter. Houses in the hills are usually made of unbaked bricks with thatch or tile roofing. At high elevations construction changes to stone masonry and slate may be used on roofs.|$|E

5000|$|Pity- Out-groups {{that are}} {{believed}} by the in-group {{to be high}} <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> but low <b>in</b> competence are pitied (Cuddy, Fiske & Glick, 2007).

25|$|Some {{confusion}} {{was introduced}} when Smith and Allen suggested changing {{the name to}} erythermalgia in order to emphasise the symptoms of painful inflammation and <b>warmth.</b> <b>In</b> their paper they showed {{for the first time}} that when their patients used aspirin, this promptly relieved the burning pain for about three days. They also suggested a distinction between primary (idiopathic) erythromelalgia and secondary erythromelalgia (due to underlying neurologic, hematologic, or vascular problems).|$|E
25|$|The Japanese macaque is diurnal. In colder areas, from autumn {{to early}} winter, macaques feed in between {{different}} activities. In the winter, macaques have {{two to four}} feeding bouts each day with fewer daily activities. In the spring and summer, they {{have two or three}} bouts of feeding daily. In warmer areas such as Yakushima, daily activities are more varied. The typical day for a macaque is 20.9% inactive, 22.8% traveling, 23.5% feeding, 27.9% social grooming, 1.2% self-grooming, and 3.7% other activities. Macaques usually sleep in trees, but also sleep on the ground, as well as on or near rocks and fallen trees. During the winter, macaques huddle together for <b>warmth</b> <b>in</b> sleeping grounds. Macaques at Jigokudani Monkey Park are notable for visiting the hot springs in the winter to warm up.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Retriever is a large-sized {{breed of}} dog bred as gun dogs to {{retrieve}} shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' {{because of their}} ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate <b>warmth</b> <b>in</b> the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual tendency to roam. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming.|$|E

25|$|Early spring can {{be quite}} cold, and {{occasionally}} the lowest temperatures of the year can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even {{in the south of}} the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above 30°C are generally rare but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when 31.9°C was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 {{in most parts of the}} UK. In Aberdaron, the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach 20°C, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be very dramatic temperature swings between day night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just 3°C at Northolt, but 25°C was reached in the afternoon. <b>Warmth</b> <b>in</b> Spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.|$|E

500|$|Abnormally cold {{temperatures}} {{plagued the}} Upper Midwest during this particular winter. [...] Between November 7, 1996, and March 18, 1997 (a span of 131 days) the air temperature only reached 40 degrees 3 times in Grand Forks. Because {{there were only}} a few days above freezing, there was very little gradual melting of the snow that fell throughout the winter. Starting on March 19, 1997, the temperature then rose above freezing for 27 consecutive days, and only eight days after that would the temperature remain below freezing. However, due to the sudden <b>warmth</b> <b>in</b> April, it melted the deep snowpack too quickly for the river to handle.|$|E
40|$|In two {{experiments}} we {{show that}} {{the context in which}} groups are perceived influences how they are judged in a compensatory manner on the fundamental dimensions of social judgment, that is, warmth and competence. We manipulate the type of country (high in competence and low <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> vs. high <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and low <b>in</b> competence) to which a target country is compared. Our data show that the target country is perceived as wanner and less competent when the comparison country is stereotypically high (vs. low) in competence and low (vs. high) <b>in</b> <b>warmth.</b> We also found compensation correlationally across targets and across dimensions in that the higher the comparison country is rated oil one of the two dimensions, the higher the target country is rated oil the other Compensation effects are shown to a to affect judgments of both the ingroup (Experiment 1) and all outgroup (Experiment 2). Our results shed new light oil context effects in group judgments as well as oil the compensatory relation of the two fundamental dimensions of social judgment.

500|$|A log structure, {{which served}} as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. During his travels in western Virginia in 1753, George Washington made mention of this structure. The log {{building}} was constructed of roughly hewn logs with clay chinking and contained puncheon log floors, hewn side up, clapboard doors, and one small window covered by a paper greased with lard. Light in the log structure {{was provided by the}} small window and a fireplace measuring [...] in height, which contained a tall pile of logs during the winter to provide for <b>warmth</b> <b>in</b> addition to lighting. The school's teachers were paid by subscriptions from the attending students. To provide for a teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of their children would attend the school and the type of payment the teacher would expect, whether in the form of cash renumeration, produce, or boarding. These early teachers were usually [...] "wandering pedagogues, settling wherever they could obtain enough signers to insure a living".|$|E

50|$|The {{researchers}} {{indicated that}} the motivation to positively stereotype groups as either warm or competent stemmed from perceived status and competition of an out-group. According to the SCM, out-groups are positively stereotyped as more competent {{to the extent that}} they are more powerful or hold higher-status. And correspondingly, out-groups are positively stereotyped as more warm {{to the extent that they}} are seen as less competition. However being positively stereotyped on one dimension usually corresponded with being negatively stereotyped on the other dimension. For instance, social out-groups viewed as subordinate and not competitive (e.g., elderly people) are often stereotyped as higher <b>in</b> <b>warmth,</b> but lower <b>in</b> competence. Being high <b>in</b> <b>warmth</b> and low <b>in</b> competence is considered to be a paternalistic stereotype, as the out-group is perceived as not inclined or incapable to harm the in-group. On the other end of the spectrum, an out-group that is perceived as high-status and highly competitive (e.g., rich people) may evoke an envious stereotype. These groups would likely be positively stereotyped as being high in competence to justify their higher relative position in society (compared to one's own in-group). However, feelings of envy or resentment about the group’s higher status is justified by perceiving them as more cold (i.e., lower <b>in</b> <b>warmth).</b>|$|R
