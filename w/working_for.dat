40|$|Working memory mediates the {{short-term}} maintenance of information. Virtually all empirical research on working memory involves investigations of <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> verbal and visual information. Whereas aging is {{typically associated with}} a deficit in <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> these types of information, recent findings suggestive of relatively well-preserved long-term memory for emotional information in older adults raise questions about <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> emotional material. This study examined age differences in <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> emotional versus visual information. Findings demonstrate that, despite an age-related deficit <b>for</b> the latter, <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> emotion was unimpaired. Further, older adults exhibited superior performance on positive relative to negative emotion trials, whereas their younger counterparts exhibited the opposite pattern...|$|R

40|$|Acetylcholine may {{regulate}} <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> novel stimuli by activating intrinsic {{mechanisms for}} sustained spiking in entorhinal cortical neurons, {{which have been}} demonstrated in slice preparations of the entorhinal cortex. Computational modeling demonstrates that loss of the cholinergic activation of intrinsic mechanisms for sustained activity could selectively impair <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> novel stimuli, whereas <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> familiar stimuli could be maintained because of previously modified synapses. Blockade of muscarinic cholinergic receptors and selective cholinergic lesions {{has been shown to}} impair encoding in delayed matching tasks. However, previous studies have not compared explicitly the role of cholinergic modulation in <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> novel versus familiar stimuli. Here, we show that lesions of the cholinergic innervation of the entorhinal cortex selectively impair delayed nonmatch to sample performance for novel odors, whereas delayed nonmatch to sample for familiar odors is spared. This indicates an important role for cholinergic innervation of the entorhinal cortex in <b>working</b> memory <b>for</b> novel stimuli.
