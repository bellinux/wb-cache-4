60|$|LADY (deeply {{offended}} by his violence). <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me? You have the explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Annette, {{you have}} {{conducted}} yourself well, {{and are very}} expert in your métier. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> this question, just at this moment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|PROSERPINE (somewhat indignantly: {{any such}} discussion, except {{by way of}} pleasantry, being outside her code of manners). How do I know? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me? ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Why</b> <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> her manager? Hes {{sitting next}} to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me here? What are {{you playing}} at, you little--" [...] At {{sight of her}} round, unmoving eyes, he stopped. She said calmly: ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter {{shook his}} head. [...] "I've seen {{him on the}} ground," [...] said he, [...] "but I never have seen him in a tree. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> Jenny Wren?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{becomes a}} thorn hedge, {{which no one}} can pass through. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> all these questions? I am sure you have {{something}} in your head.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he was saying, [...] "my name is Dusante, but <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> at this moment? Why do {{you show}} such excited concern on the subject?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "H'm. Difficult to say. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask?</b> Is the {{daughter}} of a courtesy Baron who died--of general disreputableness, I believe--before his father--? I give it up. Does it matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>you</b> simpleton?" [...] Florence indeed {{was having}} a happy time of it at Clavering rectory. When Fanny called her a simpleton, she threw her arms round Fanny's neck and kissed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "A whim of mine," [...] he said. [...] "I'm full of whims and crotchets. Old bachelors always are. But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> that {{question}} in a tone which seemed to imply that you resented my coming so soon, Miss Cornelia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the part}} of Justice to ask questions, not to answer them," [...] said the Juge d'Instruction. [...] "Levity will avail you nothing. Tell me, Buchanan, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> for the coat at the Hôtel Alsace et Lorraine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{especially}} when I am requested {{to be so}} in English: but <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me? You see nothing vehement or obtrusive in my manner; am I not tranquil enough?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing at all. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> such silly questions? I {{only meant}} that if I had married I {{should not have}} been here, and we should never have met again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plenty, {{and more}} credit. He {{is one of}} the richest men in England. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask?</b> He would not think of you, who is too troubled about other things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This very strange!" [...] he said, still earnestly {{reading my}} face. [...] "What {{interest}} {{can you have}} in a dead woman whom <b>you</b> never knew? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me that question just now? Have you any motive in coming here to see me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon. I {{should not have}} said so. It was very wrong; but, then, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> so foolish a question? Did I not tell you to let there be an end of it? And now will you {{let me give you}} one little bit of advice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|His two companions {{watched him}} with amusement, {{until at last}} Neangir roused himself. 'Explain to me, I pray you,' he said, 'the meaning of these mysteries. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me here? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> force me to drink this {{dangerous}} liquid which has set fire to my blood? Why have you shown me this picture which has almost deprived me of reason?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{there was}} nothing else to see. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask?</b> But you mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> that?" [...] she cried. [...] "You know I {{would not}} have been here had I thought you were coming. Anne promised me that you would not come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{memory is}} pretty short sometimes," [...] said Calthea, [...] "but I think I know the goods you mean, and I have seven yards of it left. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then if you didn't love me, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me {{to marry}} you?' It was his nature to {{be more or less}} {{satisfied}} when he had put any one opposed to him proportionally in the wrong; and now his exultation at having put a poser manifested itself in his tone. This, however, braced up Stephen to cope with a difficult and painful situation. It was with a calm, seemingly genial frankness, that she answered, smilingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alice Deringham simply. [...] "But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>ask</b> for it earlier, Harry? It {{would have}} saved one of us so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{is another}} matter,' said William; 'no one {{told me of}} her {{touching}} the powder. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>ask</b> her? She is publicly condemned without a hearing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> {{me to do}} this?" [...] demanded Patsy. [...] "Thomas and I {{are good}} friends, and I'd feel like a traitor {{to try to get}} him to confess a murder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... .... <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me so many questions, and egg me on {{to write}} about these people instead of minding my business? If {{you really want to}} hear, I'll tell you of Wednesday's doings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} out to Narkeet; there is a dispute between the villagers and a Talookdar as to their limits. I have got {{to look into the}} case. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> Mr. Hunter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} that when <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me to marry you I should have refused <b>you</b> because I <b>did</b> not know what money papa would give me? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>ask</b> papa?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said he to his lady, [...] "it is very {{provoking}} that {{we should}} be so few. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> not <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> the Gilberts to come to us today?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} strange, Chebron. I was not long ago asking Jethro nearly the same question, but he could give me no answer. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>ask</b> your father. He {{is one of the}} wisest of the Egyptians." ...|$|R
6000|$|She made {{no answer}} at first, {{but after a}} moment said in a tone {{he had never heard}} from her: [...] "Why do you come here this way? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me such questions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{a little}} excitement," [...] she replied. [...] "So far, I {{have not been}} disappointed. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> that question?" [...] she demanded, with a slight uneasiness. [...] "Why did you come here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he has a}} lazy fit on him. He has not {{touched it}} for ever so long. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> that? You have that furrow on your brow again. Put it away, sir!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince Abi, to affront {{those whom}} the gods have smitten, be they kings or peasants, is an unworthy deed which the gods will not forget. You know well that I have no children. <b>Why</b> then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> {{me to show}} you their loveliness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Who come yonder? Those two fellows whom {{we met at}} the table-d'hote at the [...] "Hotel de Russie" [...] {{the other}} day: gentlemen of splendid costume, and yet {{questionable}} appearances, the eldest of whom called for the list of wines, and cried out loud enough for all the company to hear, [...] "Lafite, six florins. 'Arry, shall we have some Lafite? You don't mind? No more do I then. I say, waiter, let's 'ave a pint of ordinaire." [...] Truth is stranger than fiction. You good fellow, wherever <b>you</b> are, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> 'Arry to 'ave that pint of ordinaire in the presence of your obedient servant? How could he do otherwise than chronicle the speech? ...|$|R
6000|$|She did not speak, but {{a little}} hand stole {{out from under the}} falling hair, as if to keep him. With a broken exclamation he seized it, drew her up into his arms, and laid his gray head on her fan: one, too happy for words. For a moment Jean Muir enjoyed her success; then, fearing lest some sudden mishap should destroy it, she hastened to make all secure. Looking up with well-feigned {{timidity}} and half-confessed affection, she said softly, [...] "Forgive me that I could not hide this better. I meant to go away and never tell it, but you were so kind it made the parting doubly hard. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> such dangerous questions? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> look, when you should have been writing my dismissal?" ...|$|R
