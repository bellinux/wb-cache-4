Other mammals recorded in the park are the snow vole, the edible dormouse, the wildcat and the crested porcupine.|$|E
50|$|As {{it comes}} to the fauna, the most notable species are Marsican brown bear, Italian wolf, red deer and roe deer. The number of bear {{population}} is recently declining, from about 100 it has fallen to about 30 in recent years, while the population of wolves is permanently increasing. Among the reclusive species there are the Eurasian lynx, the wild boar, the polecat, the badger, the otter, The pine marten, the beech marten and the chamois. The chamois live above the forest, which makes it difficult to encounter. Among the animals frequently seen there are some species such as the red fox, the red squirrel or dormouse. Other notable species are the <b>western</b> <b>European</b> <b>hedgehog,</b> the European mole, the wildcat, the mountain hare and the crested porcupine.There are about 60 species of mammals, 300 of birds, 40 of reptiles, amphibians and fish and they all are protected as a part of National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise.|$|E

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>{{hedgehog}}</b> (Erinaceus europaeus), {{also known}} as the West <b>European</b> <b>hedgehog</b> or common hedgehog, is a hedgehog species found in Europe, from Iberia and Italy northwards into Scandinavia. It is a generally common and widely distributed species that can survive across a wide range of habitat types. It is a well-known species, and a favorite in European gardens, both for its endearing appearance and its preference for eating a range of garden pests. While populations are currently stable across much of its range, it is thought to be declining severely in Great Britain.|$|R
