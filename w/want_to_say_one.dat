I think {{it was meant to be}} so, and would have come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I never could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of myself.

5000|$|Consolidated, an {{industrial}} dance {{group of the}} 1990s, stood against moshing. On their third album, Play More Music, they included the song [...] "The Men's Movement", which proclaimed the inappropriate nature of slamdancing. The song consisted of audio recordings during concerts from the audience and members of Consolidated, arguing about moshing.In the 1990s, the Smashing Pumpkins took a stance against moshing, following two incidents which resulted in fatalities. At a 1996 Pumpkins concert in Dublin, Ireland, 17-year-old Bernadette O'Brien was crushed by moshing crowd members and later died in the hospital, despite warnings from the band that people were getting hurt. At another concert, singer Billy Corgan said to the audience: I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> thing to you, you young, college lughead-types. I've been watchin' people like you sluggin' around other people for seven years. And you know what? It's the same shit.

5000|$|I {{do believe}} this is my interval, as we say... We've been having a {{marvelous}} time being chased {{around the country for}} three days. You know, I think it's worth mentioning because it's so idiotic, it's so ridiculous what's been happening. We came all the way to Australia because I chose to come here. I haven't been here {{for a long time and}} I wanted to come back for a few days. Wait now, wait. I'm not buttering anybody at all. I don't have to. I really don't have to. I like coming here. I like the people. I love your attitude. I like the booze and the beer and everything else that comes into the scene. I also like the way the country's growing and it's a swinging place.So we come here and what happens? We gotta run all day long because of the parasites who chase us with automobiles. That's dangerous, too, on the road, you know. Might cause an accident. They won't quit. They wonder why I won't talk to them. I wouldn't drink their water, let alone talk to them. And if any of you folks in the press are in the audience, please quote me properly. Don't mix it up, do it exactly as I'm saying it, please. Write it down very clearly. One idiot called me up and he wanted to know what I had for breakfast. What the hell does he care what I had for breakfast? I was about to tell him what I did after breakfast. Oh, boy, they're murder! We have a name in the States for their counterparts: They're called parasites. Because they take and take and take and never give, absolutely, never give. I don't care what you think about any press in the world, I say they're bums and they'll always be bums, everyone of them. There are just a few exceptions to the rule. Some good editorial writers who don't go out in the street and chase people around. Critics don't bother me, because if I do badly, I know I'm bad before they even write it, and if I'm good, I know I'm good before they write it. It's true. I know best about myself. So, a critic is a critic. He doesn't anger me. It's the scandal man who bugs you, drives you crazy. It's the two-bit-type work that they do. They're pimps. They're just crazy, you know. And the broads who work in the press are the hookers of the press. Need I explain that to you? I might offer them a buck and a half... I'm not sure. I once gave a chick in Washington $2 and I overpaid her, I found out. She didn't even bathe. Imagine what that was like, ha, ha.Now, it's a good thing I'm not angry. Really. It's a good thing I'm not angry. I couldn't care less. The press of the world never made a person a star who was untalented, nor did they ever hurt any artist who was talented. So we, who have God-given talent, say, [...] "To hell with them." [...] It doesn't make any difference, you know. And I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> more thing. From what I see what's happened since I was last here... what, 16 years ago? Twelve years ago. From what I've seen to happen with the type of news that they print in this town shocked me. And do you know what is devastating? It's old-fashioned. It was done in America and England twenty years ago. And they're catching up with it now, with the scandal sheet. They're rags, that's what they are. You use them to train your dog and your parrot. What else do I have to say? Oh, I guess that's it. That'll keep them talking to themselves for a while. I think most of them are a bunch of fags anyway. Never did a hard day's work in their life. I love when they say, [...] "What do you mean, you won't stand still when I take your picture?" [...] All of a sudden, they're God. We gotta do what they want us to do. It's incredible. A pox on them... Now, let's get down to some serious business here...|$|E

40|$|Most Indonesians learn a vernacular, {{that is the}} {{language}} of their tribe, like Javanese, Madurese or Banjarese as their first language. Later, they study Indonesians as their second language at school or informally through society. So most Indonesians are bilingualists or even multilingualists in which condition code-switching usually occurs. The objectives of this study are to find the reasons which affects the writer's Banjar relatives to switch their codes during their conversations. The subjects of the study are the writer's relatives who came from Banjar and had lived in Surabaya for quite a long time. As a result, they are bilingualist or multilingualists. And as observed. by the writer, they also apply code switching in their conversation. Under the parameters of closely-related participants, informal setting and ordinary topic to limit the scope of the study, she began collecting the data, and finally analyse the reasons which cause them to code switch. The writer found out that her Banjar relatives switch codes because of their habit of speaking Banjarese which had been created since they were children, the close relationship between the participant and the informal setting were able to cause code switching, the participants <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> express feeling and emotion, gave a stress to a phrase or a word, had inability to find words to express what they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in <b>one</b> language at the moment of speaking, so they switched to the most familiar word in another language to make the conversation smooth, and they felt that it was easier and more fluent to express sentences in Banjarese than others...|$|R

A single pearl was cut in two and used for earrings for the statue of Venus in the Pantheon at Rome, and the sum paid for it was equal to about a quarter of a million dollars.

40|$|Literature {{is created}} and {{consumed}} by human being, {{but it is}} not easy to understand or to appreciate literary works whether in the form of story, poem and novel. The readers should have a sense of art to know the massage that the author <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Novel as <b>one</b> of literary works has purpose for entertainment, enjoyment and information. Reading novel means reading the society because its story is similar with human daily life. The purpose of this study is to find out the answers to the research problems: (1) What are the main characters’ conflicts in “The Trouble with Tamsin? (2) What is the most dominant conflict? How do the main characters solve their conflicts in “The Trouble with Tamsin”? In this study, the writer of this thesis used descriptive research design, because there was no treatment as it was in experimental research. Mimetic approach was used in analyzing the study, because the thesis writer supposes literary work as the picture or reflection of real life of human being. The population of this study was the whole events or element which existed in Julie Garratt’s novel “The Trouble with Tamsin”, while the sample of this study was some paragraph or dialogue quotations that were related to the main characters conflicts. The results of this study are as follows: (1) The main characters’ conflicts in “The Trouble with Tamsin” are social conflict and psychological conflict. (2) The most dominant conflict is social conflict because it exists more frequently in the story of this novel. (3) In the end of this story, Craig Andrews died after Clare Faulkener killed him. Clare Faulkener got a terrible accident which made Patric couldn’t leave and divorce her. Meanwhile, Cass Fairburn moved to the other town to forget Patric Faulkener.
