5|$|Cosme was {{initially}} forecast to pass over Hawaii at tropical storm strength. Instead, a strong ridge of high pressure kept the system well {{south of the}} island.

5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages <b>while</b> <b>simultaneously</b> removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) <b>while</b> <b>simultaneously</b> decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E

5|$|Craterellus pusio {{was first}} {{described}} by Miles Joseph Berkeley in an 1859 publication by James Hooker. Otto Kuntze transferred {{it to the}} genus Merulius in 1891. Until the 1960s, however, it was known as Craterellus multiplex, a species described by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke and George Edward Massee in 1889, and moved to Cantharellus by Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1920. In 1958, British mycologist R.W.G. Dennis collected the species in Venezuela during an expedition financed by the Percy Sladen Memorial Trust. Derek Reid, attempting to identify the species, rediscovered Berkeley's name, which had priority, and described the new genus Podoserpula for it in 1963 <b>while</b> <b>simultaneously</b> describing four varieties of it.|$|E

5|$|Cyberpunk is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol. A concept album, it was {{released}} in 1993 by Chrysalis Records. Inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers {{in the creation of}} his music, Idol based the album on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt by Idol {{to take control of the}} creative process in the production of his albums, <b>while</b> <b>simultaneously</b> introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.|$|E

In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Fighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard {{have been}} posthumously {{diagnosed}} with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative {{disease of the}} brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers <b>while</b> <b>simultaneously</b> abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.|$|E

5|$|Rainivoninahitriniony's {{tenure as}} sole Prime Minister was short lived. His violent tendencies, {{irritability}} and insolence toward Rasoherina, {{in addition to}} lingering popular resentment over Rainivoninahitriniony's role in the violent end to Radama's rule, gradually turned {{the opinion of the}} nobles against him. As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, <b>while</b> <b>simultaneously</b> overseeing diplomatic and military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other peoples, who viewed the coup as an indication of weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force <b>while</b> <b>simultaneously</b> making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a major change in the {{perception}} of business and its role in creating value (Porter 2011). Until the recent past traditional capitalism was held up as the answer to all questions of wealth and value creation where value was seen as belonging primarily to shareholders. This perception was reinforced with the rise in interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the adoption of its principles by the majority of large investor owned firms and banks. The global recession and a string of banking scandals has shone a light on this worldview and found it wanting – organisations of all sizes are believed to be prospering at the expense of society. Shared value has been defined as ‘policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company <b>whiles</b> <b>simultaneously</b> advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates’ (Porter 2011). This view asserts that the standard operating model of businesses consists of an outdated perception of how they create value and indeed of what constitutes value. The short term focus of maximization of both profit and shareholder return has been criticised as unsustainable (Carrol 1979, Handy 2005) and the question of how organisations can create shared value (Porter 2006) is key to the redefinition of what both capitalism and CSR mean in the 21 st century and how it might evolve into a system that meets the needs of its stakeholders in the widest sense. Shared value has been defined as ‘policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company <b>whiles</b> <b>simultaneously</b> advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates’ (Porter 2011) ...|$|R
