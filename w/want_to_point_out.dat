Her {{possession}} of an unregistered vagina also equips her {{to work as a}} prostitute and spread venereal diseases. Let's hope Kletter is as responsible with her equipment as most gun owners are with theirs." ...|$|E

I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." [...] She added, [...] "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays {{make a lot of money}} and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us." ...|$|E

5000|$|Prometheus <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that {{economics}} {{could be}} a very weak reason for making decisions, while [...] "Sociology, anthropology, and other sciences have quantitative and qualitative contributions to make in the policy process. Social problems and goals beyond the economic health of media companies and their advertisers must be considered, and citizens without obvious economic interests in this proceeding should be considered to be stakeholders".|$|R

5000|$|Dufour also <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that the}} liberal project tends to {{contradict}} the concept of [...] "school" [...] in Antiquity: Greek σχολή (scholē), Latin otium = free time, i.e. the time not employed to work or duties.

60|$|A dozen {{voices were}} {{instantly}} raised in objections to this proposal. He was <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{the places where}} the hostile tracks had been seen, and his termagant sister openly scouted at the idea, as unworthy of his manhood.

[...] "I merely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that our friend has {{supplied}} the explanation of the trouble--he said he was sick the next morning. Well, as my internal cure is a powerful one, there are instructions on every bottle to take a tablespoonful every six hours, which would have carried him on for several days.

There's a great debt we {{are doing}} our best to pay, but there's {{such a thing as}} asking top much, there's such a thing as drawing the cords to {{snapping}} point. I'm speaking for Esther and mother as well as myself. We have been your slaves; in a way I suppose we are willing to go on being your slaves. It's the burden that Fate has placed around our necks, and we'll go through with it.

It's slow and deep until you reach the fall, where it's merely held up by the ridge of rock the rapid runs across. Well, we'll call the change of level twelve to sixteen feet, and, as Gordon has suggested, a big strip of natural prairie is apt to make a {{particularly}} desirable property, once you run {{the water out of}} it. You can get rid of a lot of water when you have a fall of sixteen feet." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{symbolism}} of the donkey may also refer to the Eastern tradition {{that it is an}} animal of peace, versus the horse, which is an animal of war. Therefore, a king came riding upon a horse when he was bent on war and rode upon a donkey when he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that he was coming in peace. Therefore, Jesus' entry to Jerusalem symbolized his entry as the Prince of Peace, not as a warmongering king.|$|R

I have discovered a new dramatist, and I am going to produce a play of his within three months, I hope. I shan't tell you his name and I shan't tell you anything about the play, except that I find more promise in it than anything I have seen or read for months.

It is {{perfectly}} true we were within a few yards of Lady Orstline when she called out that her necklace was stolen. There's nothing remarkable about that, however, as we occupied adjacent stalls. What I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to you is, though, if you'll allow me, that the necklace I had on the table before me at Stephano's when Mr. Cullen suddenly popped round the screen--the necklace you are now looking at, sir--is of imitation pearls, valued at about ten pounds. I bought it in the Burlington Arcade; it belongs to my daughter, and I was simply examining the clasp, which is scarcely safe." ...|$|E

"Oh! do not {{be angry}} with me, and do not fear that I am going to trouble you with soft speeches, for I shall not, unless a time should come, as I think that perhaps it will, when {{you may wish to}} listen to them.

Did I believe as you do, I should say that it was Heaven working in us--no: do not answer that the working comes from lower down. I take no credit for reading that upon your lips; the retort is too easy and obvious. I am content to say, however, that the work is that of instinct and nature, or, if you will, of fate, pointing out a road by which together we might travel to great ends." ...|$|E

"What I {{was trying}} to say up there is that at a time when visual effects movies are {{dominating}} the box office, visual effects companies are struggling," [...] Westenhofer told reporters. [...] "And I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that we aren't technicians. Visual effects is not just a commodity that's being done by people pushing buttons. We're artists, and if we don't find a way to fix the business model, we start to lose the artistry. If anything, 'Life of Pi' shows that we're artists and not just technicians." ...|$|R
