5|$|In 2009, AVEN members {{participated in}} the first asexual entry into an American pride parade <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> in the San Francisco Pride Parade. In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an asexual flag and how to set up a system to create one, and {{contacting}} as many asexual communities as possible, a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts left 700,000people {{without power}} from Miami to West Palm Beach, {{including}} the National Hurricane Center. The center briefly lost power, but during {{an hour and}} a half delay to reboot the computers, they obtained information from computers in the Mid-West and Washington, D.C. Officials from the Florida Power & Light Company were unable to repair power lines due to strong wind gusts, while Irene's flooding submerged underground lines, preventing repairs until the waters subsided. Five people, including three in one family, were killed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> through electrified waters due to downed power lines. The rains from Irene flooded roads and canals, stalling numerous cars. Three people drowned when they drove their vehicles into the canals. The floodwaters persisted for nearly a week in areas, displacing hundreds from their homes and isolating thousands. Property damage in southeastern Florida totalled to $262million.|$|E

25|$|Gummo Marx, {{the fifth}} of the Marx brothers, who quit the act during the family's {{vaudeville}} days and thus never appeared in a Marx Brothers film, was nicknamed by Art Fisher based on his habit of always wearing gumshoes. While all the other performers wore street shoes, and thus made a loud noise <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> on a hardwood stage, Milton (Gummo) was known for startling people by appearing suddenly from out of nowhere, because the gumshoes on his feet gave him a nearly soundless footfall.|$|E
25|$|The Black Seminoles {{are black}} Indians {{associated}} with the Seminole people in Florida and Oklahoma. They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, {{including the right to}} bear arms.The black seminoles also fought in the Everglade swamp, located in Southern Florida. They hid under water and tried to drown them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> pass them.|$|E

25|$|A late 19th/early 20th century {{chapter house}} of the University of Mississippi's St. Anthony Hall Phi Chapter {{subsequently}} was an on-campus childhood home of later Nobel Laureate author William Faulkner, although Rowan Oak is better known for having been his home when he achieved greatness. The older house was a large brick turreted edifice where the Alumni Center Hotel now stands. The Falkners lived in it during the period 1912–22 when fraternities were outlawed {{and was the first}} building of note that incoming freshmen saw <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> from the train station into campus. It and a successor burned down. The Cofield photographic Collection , p.58, cites Faulkner's younger brother, Dean Faulkner, that his brother's room was in the tower.|$|E
25|$|Having {{missed the}} first Victoria game Ted Dexter led the MCC in the return match. Bill Lawry won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and Ian Meckiff (5/93) had them in {{immediate}} trouble at 6/2 and 96/5. Tom Graveney was dropped in the slips, but returned to form with a magnificent 185 with 23 fours and supported by Fred Titmus (28), Alan Smith (46) and David Allen (25) he hoisted to score up to 375. Victoria's reply relied heavily on Jack Potter's 106 - nobody else made 35 - and Allen bowled himself back into form with 5/43 with help from David Larter (4/105) dismissed the Victorians for 307. The MCC made 218/5 {{to set up a}} run-chase, Ted Dexter making 70, Ken Barrington 66 and Graveney 38 not out, Meckiff taking 2/47. This left Victoria 252 minutes to make 287 runs, which they did not go for, instead they slumped to 116/7 and when Bob Cowper was out for 51 they were 148/8 with 50 minutes to go and certain to lose. Allen had taken 3/24 and Larter 3/45, but Meckiff's 38 held them up until he was dismissed by Barrington (2/60). Ken Kirby and Alan Connolly saw out the last few minutes and the game ended in a draw <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> back on 188/9.|$|E
500|$|To {{revive the}} fervor of punk, which the band felt was being {{distorted}} by new wave, the Idles sought {{to look as}} intimidating as possible. They shaved their heads, grew mohawks and wore various punk accessories. Nelson and MacKaye even drove thumbtacks into the soles of their boots so they would make an [...] "ominous clacking" [...] sound <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked.</b> The band's visual presentation was at odds with their demeanor; according to MacKaye, [...] "In our shows and within our own community, we were totally goofy guys. We were painfully honest — we didn't shoplift, we didn't vandalize, we didn't spray-paint. [...] We don't do anything — everybody just hates us {{because of the way}} we look".|$|E

500|$|McCrea {{left her}} brother's home and was {{travelling}} {{to join her}} fiancé at Ticonderoga. [...] She had reached the village by the old Fort Edward, but so had the war. She was staying {{at the home of}} Sara McNeil, another Loyalist and an elderly cousin to the British General Simon Fraser. On the morning of July 27, 1777, a group of Native Americans, an advance party from Burgoyne's army led by a Wyandot known as Le Loup or Wyandot Panther, descended on the village of Fort Edward. [...] They massacred a settler and his family, then killed Lieutenant Tobias Van Vechten and four others <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> into an ambush. [...] What happened next is a subject of some dispute; what is known is that Jane McCrea and Sara McNeil were taken by the natives and separated. [...] McNeil was eventually taken to the British camp, where either she or David Jones recognized McCrea's supposedly distinctive scalp being carried by a native.|$|E
500|$|U2's initial time at Danesmoate {{was spent}} {{recording}} and refining [...] "extensive demos" [...] that the Edge anticipated {{could turn into}} final backing tracks. They began with their usual songwriting methods of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono's lyric book, and recording jam sessions. The sessions saw the group's songwriting beginning to evolve; not all material was being worked out as a band, rather Bono and the Edge often brought basic song ideas to Mullen and Clayton. The group were first joined at Danesmoate by Eno, with Flood and fellow engineer Dave Meegan recording their jams. Meegan said of Eno's involvement: [...] "Usually he was in first every morning and he'd start some dodgy sequence on his DX-7 —it would be just like a cello line with no intentions of ever staying forever, just something to inspire people <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> into the room." [...] One of the first songs worked on was [...] "Heartland", which originated during The Unforgettable Fire sessions and was later released on the band's 1988 album, Rattle and Hum. The arrangements for [...] "With or Without You" [...] and [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times—one producer {{for a week or}} two, followed by the other. The producers encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of the Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band's musical vocabulary had improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.|$|E
2500|$|French and Saunders would {{eventually}} come to public attention {{as members of}} the informal comedy collective The Comic Strip, part of the alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s. They answered a 1980 advert in The Stage newspaper looking for female comedians to perform at The Comic Strip, which had, until that point, only had male performers. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> into the audition, they were immediately told, [...] "You're booked.

2500|$|The use of {{the term}} coincided with a fashion among teenage girls in the United States in the early 1920s for wearing unbuckled galoshes, and a {{widespread}} false etymology held that they were called [...] "flappers" [...] because they flapped <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked,</b> as they wore their overshoes or galoshes unfastened, showing that they defied convention {{in a manner similar to}} the 21st century fad for untied shoelaces. Another suggestion to the origin of the term, in relation to fashion, comes from a 1920s fashion trend in which young women left their overcoat unbuttoned to allow it to flap back and forth as they walked, appearing more independent and freed from the tight, Victorian Era style clothing.|$|E
2500|$|Breitwieser and Kleinklauss {{were first}} caught in 1997, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> {{off with a}} William van Aelst {{landscape}} from a private collection in a gallery, which {{they were allowed to}} see with special permission from the owner. [...] Alerted to the theft, the owner ran out and recognized the two as they got into Breitwieser's mother's car. [...] Another artifact was found in the car. Because it was his first offense on Swiss soil, he was given only an eight-month suspended sentence and banned from entering Switzerland until May 2000. However, his job was across the border from France in Switzerland, and he continued working under his mother's maiden name. He also continued his thefts, even returning to museums of prior crimes to steal again.|$|E
2500|$|Roberts was at {{the time}} a {{resident}} of nearby Georgetown, another unincorporated area of Bart Township. His wife last saw him at 8:45a.m. <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> their children to the bus stop before she left. When Mrs. Roberts returned home a little before 11:00a.m., she discovered four suicide notes; one addressed to herself and one to each of their three children. Roberts called his wife from the schoolhouse on his cell phone and told her that he had molested two young female relatives (between the ages of 3 and 5) 20 years previously (when he was 12) and had been daydreaming about molesting again. One note Roberts left behind indicated his despondency over a daughter who died approximately 20 minutes after birth nine years earlier. He stated that he had [...] "been having dreams {{for the past couple of}} years about doing what he did 20 years ago and he has dreams of doing them again", according to State Police Commissioner Colonel Jeffrey Miller. On October 4, 2006, the two relatives whom Roberts said he molested 20 years ago told police that no such abuse had ever happened, throwing a new layer of mystery over the gunman's motive and mental state during the shooting. KY Jelly was also found in the schoolhouse among Roberts's belongings, possibly suggesting multiple motives for the incident.|$|E
