5|$|Eddy Creek has no named tributaries. However, a 1916 book {{stated that}} several small streams {{discharged}} into the creek in its upper reaches. At the time, these streams had clear <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> were {{dry in the}} summer.|$|E
5|$|In other words, light {{appeared}} to be dragged by the <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> {{the magnitude of the}} dragging was much lower than expected.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is soluble in <b>water</b> <b>but</b> {{is almost}} {{insoluble}} in nitric acid.|$|E

50|$|Nearby is a {{swimming}} pool fed by the mineral <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> {{this is not always}} open.|$|R
50|$|Species in {{this family}} are found worldwide, mostly in {{tropical}} shallow <b>waters</b> <b>but</b> some in deep waters.|$|R
5|$|Oil floats on <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> mercury sinks below both. This is due {{to their}} {{relative}} densities.|$|E
5|$|The eastern painted turtle's diet is {{the least}} studied. It prefers {{to eat in the}} <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> has been {{observed}} eating on land. The fish it consumes are typically dead or injured.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{advancing}} science, several experiments observing {{the reaction of}} frogs to slowly heated water {{took place in the}} 19th century. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25°C.|$|E
50|$|Ommastrephids usually {{occur in}} pelagic <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> {{can also be}} found in neritic habitats. They are found worldwide.|$|R

50|$|The bay {{was long}} {{recognized}} for its deep and protected <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> development was slow {{due to lack}} of level terrain around the bay.|$|R
5|$|At a VA {{hospital}} in Fort Evanston, Maryland, Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans makes his third suicide attempt; {{he claims that}} a mysterious figure will not let him die. Stans attempts to drown in a tub of scalding <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> is rescued by the hospital staff and subsequently is disfigured due to the hot water. Stans again claims that the mysterious figure will not let him die.|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> does not readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception}} of hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance {{is a white}} solid sparingly soluble in <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Impure samples appear green due {{to the presence of}} copper(II) chloride.|$|E
50|$|Throughout her Royal Navy career Peony escorted convoys: {{primarily}} in home <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> {{sometimes in the}} Mediterranean Sea and to Freetown in Sierra Leone.|$|R
60|$|Coffee! My, {{how good}} it smelled. Billy's mouth <b>watered.</b> <b>But</b> the voice--that {{interested}} Billy {{almost as much as}} the preparations for the coming meal.|$|R
50|$|Mugil is a genus of mullet in {{the family}} Mugilidae found {{worldwide}} in tropical and temperate coastal marine <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> also entering estuaries and rivers.|$|R
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> there are no true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with}} the Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{produces}} around 4,500tonnes {{of solid}} waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking <b>water</b> <b>but</b> the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground <b>water</b> <b>but</b> also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E

50|$|Gonatus antarcticus is a squid in {{the family}} Gonatidae. The species is known with {{certainty}} only from southern Atlantic <b>waters</b> <b>but</b> it may have a circum-Antarctic distribution.|$|R
5|$|In pharmacology, {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, logp). For example, ionization of any compound {{will increase the}} solubility in <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the pKa of an ionizable group.|$|E
5|$|Many older {{buildings}} {{in certain areas}} of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area's fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquifers}} of shallow wells with depths varying from , yielding {{little more}} than 2 cubic metres/hour (71 cu ft), vary widely in availability. Deeper aquifers offer larger quantities of <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> its quality is generally brackish. The wadis are generally dry, usually only inundated after rainfall.|$|E
50|$|The lesser {{electric}} ray is most commonly found under sand or mud, in intertidal shallow <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> {{has been found}} at depths of up to 180 ft.|$|R
50|$|It spawns {{in running}} <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> inhabits in other times also many other {{habitats}} including reservoirs and marshes. Most commonly {{it is found}} in slowly running lowland rivers.|$|R
50|$|Two extant species Austrofusus glans and A. chathamensis are {{endemic to}} New Zealand <b>waters,</b> <b>but</b> most species are extinct {{and there is}} an {{abundant}} fossil record within the country.|$|R
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe liquid {{water and energy}} are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting to find another place where we might have liquid <b>water.</b> <b>But,</b> energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} lack of oxygen in the early ocean resulted in a scarcity in dissolved molybdenum. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes {{with food and}} <b>water,</b> <b>but</b> because of its low solubility, this exposure is negligible.|$|E
