5|$|While {{technically}} minded shortwave listening hobbyists dwindled {{during the}} war years {{due in part to the}} demands of military service, casual listeners seeking war news from foreign broadcasters increased. Shortwave receiver manufacturers contributed to war production. Zenith launched the multi-band Trans-Oceanic series of radios in 1942. In some other countries, {{during the war}}, listening to foreign stations <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense. Established in 1939, 35-kilowatt Chinese shortwave station XGOY broadcast programming aimed at listening-restricted Japan. The station was often bombed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{confused by the}} legal position. Disturbing a grave <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence, as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.|$|E
5|$|The western {{county of}} Augusta in Virginia {{could no longer}} {{serve the needs of}} the far flung pioneers along the New River, and so in 1769, the county of Botetourt was created. Trigg was one of several {{appointed}} as its first justices of the peace, which was a judge presiding over misdemeanors and other civil cases. From 1770 to 1771, he served as magistrate, Justice of the County Court in Chancery and a Justice of Oyer and Terminer, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> court. When the town of Fincastle, Virginia was forming in 1770, Trigg was instrumental in its development, helping to sell lots and build the town's prison along with a courthouse with his father-in-law, Israel Christian.|$|E

5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|E

Shocked at Gessler's appearance, Raeder decided to protest against the Nazi regime by not wearing the Nazi Golden Party Badge that he had worn until then. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett mocked Raeder for taking until March 1945 {{to discover that the}} Nazi regime <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> regime, and called his protest via not wearing his Golden Party Badge pathetic.|$|E

25|$|From 1723–1823, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence to blacken one's face in some circumstances, with a {{punishment}} of death. The Black Act was passed {{at a time}} of economic downturn that led to heightened social tensions, and in response to a series of raids by two groups of poachers who blackened their faces to prevent identification. Blackening one's face with soot, lampblack, boot polish or coal dust being a traditional form of disguise, or masking, in the UK, especially at night when poaching.|$|E
25|$|A {{board of}} inquiry {{was set up}} to {{investigate}} the crash. It concluded 'the most probable cause of the crash <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft'. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which would explain why no Mayday signal was given. There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A flight recorder (black box) was not located after the crash and previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed.|$|E
25|$|Between 1970 and 1989, the {{official}} exchange rate was fixed by the government through law. This exchange rate {{was used by the}} government to calculate the value of foreign trade, but foreign currency was not available to be bought and sold by private individuals. Owning or attempting to buy or sell foreign currency <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence, punishable with a prison sentence that could go up to 10 years (depending on the amount of foreign currency found under one's possession). International trade was therefore considered as part of another economic circuit than domestic trade, and given greater priority.|$|E

The Sejm pointed out that NSZ members became the most obstinate target of repressions and hate propaganda by security apparatus under Stalinism. The crimes attributed to NSZ were made up by the Soviet-installed government with logistical help from the NKVD, which in itself <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> organization according to legal definition passed by the Polish Sejm in 1998.|$|E
25|$|State of New Jersey vs. Dharun Ravi <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> trial held in Middlesex County, New Jersey Superior Court from February 24, 2012 to March 16, 2012 {{in which}} former Rutgers University {{undergraduate}} student Dharun Ravi was tried and convicted on 15 counts of crimes involving invasion of privacy, attempted invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution. The charges stemmed from incidents that occurred on September 19 and 21, 2010. On September 9, 2016, a New Jersey {{court of appeals}} overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial on narrower charges. The following month, Ravi accepted a plea deal and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy.|$|E
25|$|Sedition, {{which is}} {{committed}} when spoken or written words are published with seditious intent, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence under English common law. It emerged {{in an era}} where political violence threatened the stability of governments. The Star Chamber, {{in the case of}} De Libellis Famosis (1572), defined seditious libel (that is, sedition in a printed form) as the criticism of public persons or the government, and established it as a crime. The crime of sedition was premised on the need to maintain respect for the government and its agents, for criticism of public persons or the government undermines respect for public authorities. Even though the Star Chamber was later dissolved, seditious libel had become established as a common law offence.|$|E
