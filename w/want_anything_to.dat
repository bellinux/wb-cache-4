He eventually turned heel and started teaming with the Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) in an apprenticetype role. While teaming with CTU, {{he began a}} losing streak, aggravating his teammates {{to such a degree}} that they did not <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with him anymore. This led to him being given one final chance on 6 October, where he rose to the occasion and impressed his CTU teammates enough to continue his association with them. To solidify his status with the stable, Devitt teamed with CTU leader, Jushin Thunder Liger to take on Wataru Inoue and Ryusuke Taguchi. In a huge twist, Devitt was the one to make the final cover on Inoue following a stiff brainbuster. From then on he was officially recognized as a member of the CTU.|$|E

Although Silver called Moore directly to apologise, no public retraction appeared. Moore was quoted as saying that the comic book had been [...] "specifically about things like fascism and anarchy.

2500|$|After {{the film}} release in November, Akhil Rajendra Dwivedi, a script writer, sued Bhansali for Rs. 20million {{alleging that the}} {{director}} used his script without informing him.

He alleged that the director had loved the script and said that he would get back to Dwivedi in a few weeks time. Dwivedi claimed that Bhansali never reverted and was unreachable for Dwivedi. Salman Khan, a close associate of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, in an award ceremony Super Idols, for felicitating specially abled people, by television channel IBN-7, took potshots at Guzaarish, hinting at its poor box office collection and said that [...] "Recently a movie released, Guzaarish, oops sorry! and I made a movie on HIV/ AIDS, not even a dog came to watch the movie."

Jim Bellamy became so enraged he took off his belt and whipped the boy with his belt right there in the field. Joe saw the event {{and went back to the}} packing house on the farm and told his black friends what he had seen. It wasn't long before Jim Bellamy saw Joe and asked him why he told what he had witnessed. Joe then told Bellamy he didn't know what he was talking about, but Bellamy didn't believe Joe and told Joe to get off the farm before he took off his belt again. Joe told him he better keep his pants up because he wasn't going to use his belt on him. Jim then analyzed Joe for a bit and eventually said [...] "Go on, get the hell outta here."

2500|$|Paranoid was {{originally}} titled War Pigs, but {{the record company}} allegedly changed it {{out of fear of}} a backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. Additionally, the band's label felt the title track was more marketable as a single. Ozzy Osbourne states in I Am Ozzy that the name change {{had nothing to do with}} the Vietnam War, and was entirely due to the record company deciding the album would be easier to sell if it was named after the single, which had already had significant success by the time the album was released, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. It was too late, however, to alter the artwork. Joe Smith, who was executive vice-president at Warner Bros. from 1970 to 1972, told Classic Albums that the rest of Warner Bros. didn't <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with them: [...] "We were in the midst of the war ourselves in this country and what their reasoning was not that important to me. [...] I knew we weren't going to call it 'War Pigs'." [...] Regarding the song [...] "Paranoid", Smith recalls, [...] "It was on an acetate. I remember playing it and turning the sound way up and shaking the whole building... I said 'I think that's the breakthrough album. I don't understand it but that 'Paranoid' sounds like a great title for an album and a great title for a single. [...] "That album title had nothing to do with the sleeve," [...] Osbourne explained to Phil Alexander in 1998. [...] "What the fuck does a bloke dressed as a pig with a sword in his hand got to do with being paranoid, I don't know, but they decided to change the album title without changing the artwork." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beria was no easy man to defeat, and his ethnicisation {{policies}} (that a {{local or}} republican leaders {{had to have}} ethnic origins, and speak {{the language of the}} given area) proved to be a tool to strengthen the MVD's grip on local party organs. Khrushchev and Malenkov, who had begun receiving information which stated that the MVD had begun spying on party officials, started to act in the spring of 1953. Beria was defeated at the next Presidium plenums by a majority against him, and not long after, Khrushchev and Malenkov started to plan Beria's fall from power. However, this was no easy task, as Beria was able to inspire fear in his colleagues. In Khrushchev's and Malenkov's first discussion with Kliment Voroshilov, Voroshilov did not <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with it, because he feared [...] "Beria's ears". However, Khrushchev and Malenkov were able to gather enough support for Beria's ouster, but only when a rumour of a potential coup led by Beria began to take hold within the party leadership. Afraid of the power Beria held, Khrushchev and Malenkov were prepared for a potential civil war. This did not happen, and Beria was forced to resign from all his party posts on 26 June, and was later executed on 23 December. Beria's fall also led to criticism of Stalin; the party leadership accused Beria of using Stalin, a sick and old man, to force his own will on the Soviet Union during Stalin's last days. This criticism, and much more, led party and state newspapers to launch more general criticism of Stalin and the Stalin era. A party history pamphlet {{went so far as to}} state that the party needed to eliminate [...] "the incorrect, un-Marxist interpretation of the role of the individual in history, which is expressed in propaganda by the idealist theory of the cult of personality, which is alien to Marxism".|$|E
