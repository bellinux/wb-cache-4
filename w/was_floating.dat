5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who <b>was</b> <b>floating</b> alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 1842, Francisco Lopez, {{the uncle}} of Antonio's second wife, Jacoba Feliz, took a rest under {{an oak tree}} in Placerita Canyon and had a dream that he <b>was</b> <b>floating</b> on a pool of gold. When he awoke, he pulled a few wild onions from the ground finding flakes of gold in the roots. Contrary to some portraits {{of him as a}} farmer who {{stumbled}} upon his discovery by dumb luck, Lopez had studied mineralogy at the University of Mexico and had been actively searching for gold. Evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area about thirty years prior, but the Lopez gold find was the first popularly documented incident in the area. This sparked a gold rush on a much smaller scale than the 1849 California Gold Rush. About 2,000 people, mostly from the Mexican state of Sonora, came to Rancho San Francisco to mine the gold.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "jumboization" [...] process {{consisted}} of five basic steps. First, the bow was removed and {{retained in the}} drydock {{while the rest of}} the ship <b>was</b> <b>floated</b> out. Next, the new section <b>was</b> <b>floated</b> in, raised, and joined to the bow. Third, the bridge structure was transferred to the new section by heavy lift crane on 9 January 1964. Then the stern section was severed and retained in drydock while the old midsection <b>was</b> <b>floated</b> out. In the last step, the new section with bow and bridge structure attached, <b>was</b> <b>floated</b> into the dock, raised, and joined to the stern.|$|R

25|$|Calleja {{received}} his appointment as Venegas's replacement on January 28, 1813, {{but did not}} actually take up the post until March 4. His initial assessment {{of the state of}} affairs was not encouraging. The government coffers were empty, and the government <b>was</b> <b>floating</b> a large debt. More than two million pesos were owed to the troops. Whole units lacked adequate uniforms and boots. Armament was in a bad state and there was a shortage of horses.|$|E
25|$|At 3.15 p.m. an {{amphibian}} aircraft, piloted by {{a senior}} {{officer of the}} RAAF based on the Rathmines, took off on a reconnaissance flight to seaward.

He found {{a great deal of}} wreckage <b>was</b> <b>floating</b> on the surface with the amphibian sighting the wreck site within ten minutes of the explosion an. The pilot landed the plane but found the water much rougher than he had expected. Because of the seas and the extent of the wreckage, he was unable to taxi close to one large piece of the flotsam, to which he could see a group of men clinging desperately. He taxied the machine some distance to the lea of a small island, where sheltered water enabled him to take off.|$|E

500|$|In April 1928, Reynolds {{signed a}} 67-year lease {{of the plot}} and {{finalized}} {{the details of his}} ambitious project. Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a decorative jewel-like glass crown. It also featured a base in which the showroom windows were tripled in height and topped by 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, creating an impression that the tower <b>was</b> <b>floating</b> in mid-air. Originally, the skyscraper would have risen , with 67 floors. When Van Alen's drawings were unveiled in the following August, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) praised the plan's deviations from the designs of previous skyscrapers, as well as its unique architecture. Reynolds's main contribution to the building's design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown, despite the initial opposition of Van Alen. These plans were approved in June 1928. The metal-and-crystal crown would have looked like [...] "a jeweled sphere" [...] at night.|$|E
500|$|Despite the Vansant incident, beaches {{along the}} Jersey Shore {{remained}} open. Sightings of large sharks swarming {{off the coast}} of New Jersey were reported by sea captains entering the ports of Newark and New York City but were dismissed. The second major attack occurred 45miles (72km) north of Beach Haven at the resort town of Spring Lake, New Jersey. The victim was Charles Bruder, 27, a Swiss bell captain at the Essex & Sussex Hotel. Bruder was killed on Thursday, July 6, 1916, while swimming 130yards (120m) from shore. A shark bit him in the abdomen and severed his legs; Bruder's blood turned the water red. After hearing screams, a woman notified two lifeguards that a canoe with a red hull had capsized and <b>was</b> <b>floating</b> just at the water's surface. Lifeguards Chris Anderson and George White rowed to Bruder in a lifeboat and realized he had been bitten by a shark. They pulled him from the water, but he bled to death on the way to shore. According to The New York Times, [...] "women [...] panic-stricken [...] as [...] mutilated body... brought ashore." [...] Guests and workers at the Essex & Sussex and neighboring hotels raised money for Bruder's mother in Switzerland.|$|E

500|$|With the Antarctic summer waning, Stenhouse had to {{consider}} the possibility that Aurora might be trapped for another year, and after reviewing fuel and stores he ordered the capture of more seals and penguins. This proved difficult, as the soft state of the ice made travel away from the ship hazardous. As the ice encasing the ship melted, the timber seams opened and were admitting around three to four feet (about a metre) of water daily, requiring regular work with the pumps. On 12 February, while the crew were busy with this activity, the ice around the ship finally began to break away. Within minutes the whole floe had splintered into fragments, a pool of water opened up, and Aurora <b>was</b> <b>floating</b> free. Next morning Stenhouse ordered the setting of sails, but on 15 February the ship was stopped by accumulated ice and remained, unable to move, for a further two weeks. Stenhouse was reluctant to use the engines because coal supplies were low, but on 1 March he decided he had no choice; he ordered steam to be raised, and next day the ship edged forward under engine power. After a series of stops and starts, on 6 March the edge of the ice was sighted from the crow's nest. On 14 March Aurora finally cleared the pack, after a drift of 312days covering [...] Stenhouse recorded the ship's position on reaching the open sea as latitude 64°27'S, longitude 157°32'E.|$|E
