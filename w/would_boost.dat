5|$|On 29 November 2011, {{the member}} state finance ministers agreed {{to expand the}} EFSF by {{creating}} certificates that could guarantee up to 30% of new issues from troubled euro-area governments, and to create investment vehicles that <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> the EFSF's firepower to intervene in primary and secondary bond markets.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
50|$|On August 21, 2006, President George W. Bush {{announced}} that US reconstruction aid to Lebanon <b>would</b> be <b>boosted</b> to 230 million dollars.|$|R

30|$|A European imaging biobanks network <b>would</b> {{significantly}} <b>boost</b> European {{research in}} the imaging domain by stimulating the design and validation of new imaging biomarkers, as well as improving our understanding of their biological significance.|$|R
5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment. These studies continued until 1962. In May 1958, ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of an atomic explosion on the Moon. The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth. It was hoped that such a display <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> the morale of the American people.|$|E
5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would {{be passed on to}} businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies, which it was hoped <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> exports from the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Texas vs. Ohio State {{football}} game, played September 10, 2005, was {{the first-ever}} meeting between The University of Texas at Austin and The Ohio State University {{in a college}} football game. The two teams came into the game ranked No. 2 and No. 4, respectively. It was the second game of the 2005 season for both teams. Schools have become increasingly conservative in scheduling non-conference opponents of a high caliber, so a meeting of two top-five teams in the country was unusual {{this early in the}} season. For either team, winning the game <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> their chances of ultimately playing in the BCS National Championship Game while the loser likely faced the end of their national championship hopes.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission {{estimated}} that this proposed {{version of the}} Directive would have created an additional 600,000 jobs in the EU, <b>would</b> have <b>boosted</b> economic growth, and would have increased product quality and choice for consumers.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for loss: Despite {{an overall}} strong effort, the team just fell short. Trump {{felt that if}} they had dropped their price a little lower, it <b>would</b> have <b>boosted</b> their sales by enough to carry them to victory.|$|R
5000|$|Dubai's recent {{economic}} and structural development were seen {{to play in}} its favor. [...] The construction of the Dubai Sports City and a multitude of new hotels - such as the Burj al-Arab - <b>would</b> also <b>boost</b> its chances.|$|R
5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} on a Saturday night timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely to}} watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> its timeslot. However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm timeslot, and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun of the coverage of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC Choice. In the US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes edited out to accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|E
5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E
5|$|The rivers Mersey and Irwell {{were first}} made navigable {{in the early}} 18th century. Goods were also transported on the Runcorn {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal (from 1776) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (from 1830), but by the late 19th century the Mersey and Irwell Navigation had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable. In addition, Manchester's business community viewed the charges imposed by Liverpool's docks and the railway companies as excessive. A ship canal was therefore proposed {{as a way of}} giving ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester. The region was suffering from the effects of the Long Depression, and for the canal's proponents, who argued that the scheme <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> competition and create jobs, the idea of a ship canal made sound economic sense. They initiated a public campaign to enlist support for the scheme, which was first presented to Parliament as a bill in 1882. Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool, the canal's supporters were unable to gain the necessary Act of Parliament to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885.|$|E
50|$|Proponents of the {{proposal}} argue that leaving the euro and reintroducing the drachma <b>would</b> dramatically <b>boost</b> exports and tourism and while discouraging expensive imports and thereby give the Greek economy the possibility to recover and {{stand on its own}} feet.|$|R
50|$|Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee Hwa was {{instrumental}} in introducing the Disneyland project to Hong Kong. When the SARS epidemic devastated the city's economy in 2003, {{it was hoped that}} the new Disneyland <b>would</b> help <b>boost</b> confidence in Hong Kong's tourism industry.|$|R

25|$|The county {{chairman}} Chris Grant {{was also}} excited to have Rana Naved signed for the 2012 season.

25|$|As Lampreia would state, {{one of the}} Brazil’s {{motivations for}} NPT {{accession}} was the belief that it <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> Brazil’s international credibility. Additionally, Argentina had already joined the regime in 1995 and its membership consisted of nearly {{every country in the}} world. Accordingly, Brazil did not want to remain isolated.|$|E
25|$|Anderson Greenwood's sole {{aircraft}} design {{was actually a}} collaborative effort of three engineers: Ben Anderson, Marvin Greenwood & Lomis Slaughter Jr. The name of the last member of the design team {{was not included in}} the product name as it was thought it <b>would</b> not <b>boost</b> sales.|$|R
50|$|Including two {{murders in}} the capital city, 4 {{people were killed in}} the space of a week in Canberra and in Sydney. As a result of {{heightening}} violence, New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees announced the state police anti-gang squad <b>would</b> be <b>boosted</b> to 125 members from 50.|$|R
50|$|After {{its first}} anniversary, the network faced low ratings and higher {{financial}} losses than expected. However, {{it was hoped}} that a planned advertising campaign <b>would</b> help <b>boost</b> awareness of the station. The Toronto transmitter power was also to be increased to 100 000 watts in by the end of 1978.|$|R
25|$|However, in September 2008, Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) {{announced}} that De Toppers would represent the Netherlands in Moscow. The trio, consisting of René Froger, Jeroen van der Boom and Gordon (Dutch national final contestant in 1990 and 2003), are highly {{popular in the}} Netherlands, and NOS hoped that they <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> Eurovision figures in the Netherlands, as well as ratings of the national final.|$|E
25|$|Imbalances in {{international}} trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard. A country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply. The resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of prices <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> exports; thus the deficit would be rectified. Any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have {{a decrease in the}} amount of money available to spend.|$|E
25|$|Gross {{domestic}} product growth of 3.6% in 2000 {{was expected to}} have fallen to around 1.5% in 2001, and only a minor recovery was forecast for 2002. The government was hoping that tax cuts, subsidies on child-care expenses, and wage increases <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> consumer confidence with real disposable income to increase by 5.4%. Exports were also expected to pick up in 2002, helped by {{the weakness of the}} Swedish krona, which hit record lows against both the dollar and the Euro in 2001.|$|E
3000|$|The {{flavonoid}} {{rings and}} ionone rings might have {{interfered with the}} gene expression, immune modulation and <b>would</b> have <b>boosted</b> the antioxidant effect resulting in apoptosis and death of cancer cells.

50|$|On 24 November 2008, the than Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, {{carried a}} state visit in Tirana, {{where he met}} with his {{counterpart}} PM Sali Berisha. During this visit an agreement was signed {{on the construction of}} two coal-fired power plants, financed by Italy which <b>would</b> help <b>boost</b> Albania's economy.|$|R
50|$|H2 {{previously}} {{purchased a}} controlling stake in another European automotive aftermarket parts distribution company called Sator Holdings, the market leader in Benelux and Northern France. It was hoped that H2's controlling interest in Sator <b>would</b> eventually <b>boost</b> {{the number of}} parts offered by Unipart Automoitive in the UK from 90,000 to 160,000.|$|R
25|$|In {{his memoirs}} Admiral Halsey gave four reasons for why he {{attacked}} Kure despite McCain's objections. Firstly, {{he believed that}} the attack <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> US morale and retaliate for the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, secondly it would ensure that the Japanese could not disrupt the planned Soviet invasion of Hokkaido, thirdly it would prevent Japan from using its fleet as a bargaining point to secure better peace terms and finally that he had been ordered to conduct the attack by his superior officer, Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2009, a {{free trade}} {{agreement}} (FTA) with the ASEAN regional bloc of ten countries and Australia, and its close partner New Zealand was signed. It is believed that this FTA <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> combined GDP across the twelve countries by more than US$48billion over the period between 2000 and 2020. ASEAN members, together with the group's six major trading partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea), began the first round of negotiations on 26–28 February 2013, in Bali, Indonesia on the establishment of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.|$|E
25|$|Policy {{planners}} {{debated the}} necessity and economic viability of high-speed rail service. Supporters argued that high-speed rail <b>would</b> <b>boost</b> future economic growth. Opponents noted that high-speed rail {{in other countries}} were expensive and mostly unprofitable. Overcrowding on existing rail lines, they said, could be solved by expanding capacity through higher speed and frequency of service. In 1995, Premier Li Peng announced that preparatory work on the Beijing Shanghai HSR would begin in the 9th Five Year Plan (1996–2000), but construction was not scheduled until {{the first decade of}} the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, LOHA {{president}} Janet Allen, and LOHA treasurer Bobbie Rosenfeld {{attended the}} 38th {{meeting of the}} Ontario Hockey Association and asked the OHA to help endorse the league. In the process, they announced that if the OHA <b>would</b> help <b>boost</b> its membership, the LOHA would create a provincial championship for its member teams.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, {{longtime}} {{college football}} assistant and NCSU alum Chuck Amato {{was hired as}} State's head football coach. Although Amato had no head coaching or coordinating experience, NCSU felt that Amato's eighteen-year tenure as defensive line coach under Bobby Bowden at Florida State, winning two national championships, <b>would</b> help <b>boost</b> recruiting, ticket sales, and program prestige.|$|R
5000|$|First stage {{engine burn}} would go until {{propellant}} depletion unlike Titan ICBMs which {{were designed to}} cut off when propellant flow/pressure and engine thrust started dropping as the tanks emptied. This was to prevent {{the possibility of a}} malfunctioning pressure sensor triggering an abort condition. Also running until depletion <b>would</b> slightly <b>boost</b> the Titan's lift capacity.|$|R
