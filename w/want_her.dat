5|$|When Duarte {{suddenly}} {{died and}} his mistress {{and their children}} sought to attend his funeral, there was an unpleasant scene at the church gates. Although Juana {{and the children were}} permitted to enter and pay their respects to Duarte, they were promptly directed out of the church. Mrs. Juan Duarte did not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> husband's mistress and children at the funeral and, as those of the legitimate wife, her orders were respected.|$|E
5|$|After Brian reveals Meg's {{secret to}} Peter and Lois, who don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> seeing Luke again, he soon breaks {{out of jail}} during a prison riot and tries {{to hide in the}} Griffins' house. When Brian comes to Meg's room to {{apologize}} for what he did to her, he finds him just as Peter enters. Peter only knows what is happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, {{following}} {{his release from}} prison, {{it was announced that}} Evans would resume training with Sheffield United after the Professional Footballers' Association had requested that Sheffield United let Evans train at the club as they were his last club before his conviction. The decision was controversial, and caused television presenter Charlie Webster, businesswoman Lindsay Graham and musicians Dave Berry and Paul Heaton to resign as patrons of the club. Athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill stated that she would <b>want</b> <b>her</b> name removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evans were signed by the club.|$|E
50|$|Three lost women cross {{paths and}} help each other. Elodie (Olivia Bonamy) <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} back, Natacha (Marina Foïs) <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> cat back, and Marianne (Amira Casar) <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> soul back.|$|R
60|$|Finding {{themselves}} {{helpless and}} balked of their revenge, the Six Snubnosed Princesses finally recovered from their excitement {{and settled down}} to a pleasant sisterly quarrel, as was their customary amusement. Indigo wanted to have Trot patched, and Cerulia <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> beaten with knotted cords, and Cobalt <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> {{locked up in a}} dark room, and Sapphire <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> fed on sand, and Turquoise <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> bound to a windmill, and so between these various desires, they quarreled and argued until dinner time arrived.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title is}} {{a play on}} words, with the narrator of the song saying to his girlfriend he <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> [...] "to be bad" [...] as in a dominatrix way, rather than he <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> [...] "badly".|$|R
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not <b>want</b> <b>her.</b> Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that he}} hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Megan tells Don {{that her}} {{audition}} gained her a callback for Little Murders and rehearsals begin shortly in Boston. He voices his displeasure at her being gone for three months. She accuses him of expecting her acting career to fail. When the callback {{does not go}} well, she tells him that, if she has to choose {{between him and the}} play, she would choose him, but will hate him for it. He assures her that he does not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to fail, and they kiss.|$|E
5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, every {{studio in}} Hollywood (except Paramount) and even {{overseas}} <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> services. Mary Pickford stated that Bow [...] "was {{a very great}} actress" [...] and <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to play her sister in Secrets (1933), Howard Hughes offered her a three-picture deal, and MGM <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to star in Red-Headed Woman (1932). Bow agreed to the script, but eventually rejected the offer since Irving Thalberg required her to sign a long-term contract.|$|R

5|$|David {{begins by}} sending poison pen letters to Nick's wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), which state that Nick {{is having an}} affair. Nick realises David is behind the letters. Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he knew all along and does not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs {{the steering wheel and}} causes a car crash. Price believed David was not trying to murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5|$|Libby accuses Zeke {{of writing}} Kyle Canning's (Christopher Milligan) essay for him, but Sunny reveals that she wrote it. Kyle was blackmailing her after he overheard Sunny telling Donna {{that her parents}} {{did not know about}} Zeke moving home. Karl and Susan make Sunny call her parents and tell them about Zeke. Sunny tells them that her parents <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to come home. Zeke tells Sunny that he will go to South Korea with her. However, when Sunny realises how much Susan and Karl need him, she tells him to stay. On her last day, Zeke organises a picnic and a {{performance}} at Charlie's from The Black Skirts. A few days after her departure, Sunny texts Zeke and tells him not to contact her again.|$|E
60|$|Yet he <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> still, he always, always <b>wanted</b> <b>her.</b> In his soul, he was desolate as a child, {{he was so}} helpless. Like a {{child on}} its mother, he {{depended}} on her for his living. He knew it, {{and he knew he}} could hardly help it.|$|R

He's been having her {{pretend to be}} Susan, T-Bag's ex. The prostitute <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> money. T-Bag prepares to pay her and insults her. The prostitute replies saying it's no wonder why Susan left him, calling Susan a [...] "bitch." [...] She {{attempts}} to leave, but T-Bag blocks her exit. She threatens to scream if he doesn't move.

50|$|Knight and Day - Pat Day {{is removed}} from her foster family because her natural mother, Mrs Knight, {{suddenly}} <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> back after years of ignoring her. But Pat soon finds that <b>her</b> mother only <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> {{so they can get}} a council flat, and her stepsister Janet is spiteful.|$|R
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her {{to start at the}} most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Tommy {{is under}} day-release, Toshiko (Naoko Mori) elects {{to keep him}} company. Whilst Toshiko spends time with Tommy, Jack (John Barrowman) and Gwen (Eve Myles) {{discover}} that the abandoned Cardiff hospital is showing signs of time distortion, with elements of the 1918 hospital appearing in the present. Meanwhile, Toshiko and Tommy grow closer; after an afternoon in the pub, he kisses her romantically. Later, Toshiko's colleague Owen (Burn Gorman) realises that Toshiko has developed feelings for Tommy and warns her to be careful as he does not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to get hurt. Upon their return, Jack realizes that the present year is when Tommy will be needed: {{he will have to}} travel back to 1918 and activate a Rift Key to close the connection between 1918 and the present and prevent disaster. As Tommy is due to be executed for cowardice three weeks after his return to 1918, Tosh initially refuses to let him go back. Jack persuades her of the necessity of Tommy's return.|$|E

5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E
