5|$|As {{noted by}} {{astrophysicist}} Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his 1995 commentary on Newton's Principia, this theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped {{for over three}} centuries. Since 1997, the theorem has been studied by Donald Lynden-Bell and collaborators. Its first exact extension came in 2000 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Mahomed and Vawda.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{the sixteenth}} century marked the {{beginning}} of the English Renaissance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> writers William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Sir Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Sir Philip Sidney, as well as great artists, architects (such as Inigo Jones who introduced Italianate architecture to England), and composers such as Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, and William Byrd.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} warning service {{was set up}} in the 1870s from Cuba <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Father Benito Viñes. After his death, {{hurricane warning}} services were assumed by the United States Signal Corps and United States Weather Bureau over the next decade, first based in Jamaica in 1898 and Cuba in 1899 before shifting to Washington, D.C. in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves {{appear in}} much of Tolkien's early poetry, and have {{influence}} upon his later works {{in part due to}} the influence of a production of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan in Birmingham in 1910 and his familiarity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Catholic mystic poet, Francis Thompson which Tolkien had acquired in 1914.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{poll shows}} {{a high degree}} of {{satisfaction}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the local police department. More than half the people surveyed during a 2005–2006 poll declared themselves satisfied (62.3%) or very satisfied (3.3%) with the activity of the county police department. The study found the highest satisfaction with car traffic supervision, the presence of officers in the street, and road education; on the negative side, corruption and public transport safety remain concerns.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E

5|$|Beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} {{have noticed}} that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime {{is closely related to}} two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E
5|$|Copper medals {{were struck}} to commemorate {{each of the}} contestants. The obverse side of these {{contained}} {{a picture of the}} respective fighter; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella! Horrida bella! (a quotation from Virgil which can be translated as wars, horrible wars) and the words Strength and magnanimity in the case of Perrins, and Science and intrepidity for that of Johnson. Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by his employers and says that they bear similarities <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a French die maker called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791. The National Portrait Gallery holds two pictures of the Banbury fight, one being an etching published by George Smeeton in 1812, and the other by Joseph Grozer in 1789.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, who had used the process to separate gases.|$|E
5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|In India simple {{artificial}} plant classification {{systems of}} the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Parashara (c. 400 – c. 500 AD), the author of Vṛksayurveda (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: Samiganiya (Fabaceae), Puplikagalniya (Rutaceae), Svastikaganiya (Cruciferae), Tripuspaganiya (Cucurbitaceae), Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae), and Kurcapuspaganiya (Asteraceae). Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the Prthviniraparyam of Udayana, Nyayavindutika of Dharmottara, Saddarsana-samuccaya of Gunaratna, and Upaskara of Sankaramisra.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} he {{was familiar}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Galen, <b>with</b> Ptolemaic astronomy, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> geographical <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Marinus and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> studies of Islamic geographers and astronomers.|$|R
25|$|A modern naturalistic view of {{the ancient}} world, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{abandonment}} of the term Antediluvian, came about <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Darwin and Agassiz in the 1860s.|$|R
50|$|Geneticism is {{a school}} of thought that holds that {{genetics}} determines all human characteristics, particularly psychological characteristics. This concept is primarily associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Francis Galton.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} epoch (1907–19), Noether dealt {{primarily}} with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, {{and her work}} became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her seminal work for physics, the two Noether's theorems.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest, though challenged {{the inclusion of}} chapters focussed on the environment. They also criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of,</b> the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as Robert Garner, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Alasdair Cochrane, Kimberly Smith or Siobhan O'Sullivan. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as the one which engaged most directly with this literature; his approach, however, was a negative one. Garner has written that Political Animals and Animal Politics should be praised for its trailblazing, but predicted {{that it would be}} superseded by stronger collections on the same theme.|$|E
5|$|Second, it {{was then}} that Japan {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
50|$|His style evolved through contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Andrea del Castagno, Alesso Baldovinetti and Sandro Botticelli. The art scholar Bernard Berenson {{regarded}} {{him as a}} follower of Cosimo Rosselli.|$|R
50|$|According to {{literature}} critics, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Stjepan Blažetin <b>the</b> poetry in Croatian of Hungarian Croats {{has entered the}} postmodern era. Blažetin's poetry {{is influenced by the}} poetry of Joja Ricov.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, {{the first}} major defeats of the Ottoman Empire reduced the {{perceived}} threat in European minds, which led to an artistic craze for things Turkish, Turquerie, just as there was a fashion for Chinese things with Chinoiserie, both of which became constitutive components of the Rococo style. Orientalism started to become hugely popular, first <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Jean-Baptiste van Mour, who had accompanied the embassy of Charles de Ferriol to Istanbul 1699 and stayed there until {{the end of his life}} in 1737, and later <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Boucher and Fragonard.|$|R
5|$|The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, {{probably}} by local man Thomas Sabin, {{has been compared}} favourably <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of CharlesII high on the west wall of the nave. The alabaster pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.|$|E
5|$|The European Renaissance brought {{expanded}} {{interest in}} both empirical {{natural history and}} physiology. In 1543, Andreas Vesalius inaugurated the modern era of Western medicine with his seminal human anatomy treatise De humani corporis fabrica, {{which was based on}} dissection of corpses. Vesalius was {{the first in a series}} of anatomists who gradually replaced scholasticism with empiricism in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience rather than authority and abstract reasoning. Via herbalism, medicine was also indirectly the source of renewed empiricism in the study of plants. Otto Brunfels, Hieronymus Bock and Leonhart Fuchs wrote extensively on wild plants, the beginning of a nature-based approach to the full range of plant life. Bestiaries—a genre that combines both the natural and figurative knowledge of animals—also became more sophisticated, especially <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> William Turner, Pierre Belon, Guillaume Rondelet, Conrad Gessner, and Ulisse Aldrovandi.|$|E
5|$|The {{charge on}} {{electrons}} and protons is opposite in sign, hence {{an amount of}} charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.|$|E
50|$|Fantasy {{literature}} was popular in Victorian times, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> {{writers such as}} Mary Shelley (1797 - 1851), William Morris and George MacDonald, and Charles Dodgson, author of Alice in Wonderland (1865).|$|R
