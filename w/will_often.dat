5|$|Senators may {{be members}} of joint {{committees}}: committees jointly established by both chambers of the Australian parliament. In addition, political parties <b>will</b> <b>often</b> have caucus committees comprising members of the parliamentary party; these committees <b>will</b> <b>often</b> have a policy focus, but are not committees of the parliament and are not bound by any of parliament's rules of procedures.|$|E

5|$|Courtship {{begins with}} a noisy flight by the male, {{followed}} by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down. After landing, the male will approach the female with a puffed-out breast, bobbing head, and loud calls. Mated pairs <b>will</b> <b>often</b> preen each other's feathers.|$|E
5|$|Fold order. Determining {{the order}} in which {{different}} parts of a protein fold is challenging due to the extremely fast time scales involved. Circularly permuted versions of proteins <b>will</b> <b>often</b> fold in a different order, providing information about the folding of the original protein.|$|E
25|$|Hilary Putnam {{has argued}} that any theory of {{mathematical}} realism would include quasi-empirical methods. He proposed that an alien species doing mathematics might well rely on quasi-empirical methods primarily, being <b>willing</b> <b>often</b> to forgo rigorous and axiomatic proofs, and still be doing mathematics—at perhaps a somewhat greater risk of failure of their calculations. He gave a detailed argument for this in New Directions.|$|R

5|$|Like {{many other}} parrots, kakapos {{have a variety}} of calls. As well as the booms (see below for a recording) and chings of their mating calls, they <b>will</b> <b>often</b> loudly skraark to {{announce}} their location to other birds.|$|E
5|$|Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders {{are known}} to exhibit {{elaborate}} courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it <b>will</b> <b>often</b> vibrate its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals.|$|E
5000|$|By 1948, Wills' {{drinking}} {{was becoming}} too {{out of control}} for Duncan. <b>Wills</b> <b>often</b> missed shows, and when the headliner failed to appear, the band's pay reverted to union scale. After a string of performances in 1948 without Wills, Wills overheard Duncan complaining one night before a performance. Wills told guitarist Eldon Shamblin to [...] "fire" [...] Duncan, who set out to form his own band.|$|R

5|$|Pugs {{have many}} {{wrinkles}} in their faces, so owners <b>will</b> <b>often</b> clean inside the creases to avoid irritation and infection. If {{this is not}} done, the dog may develop a condition known as skin fold dermatitis.|$|E

5|$|The wool {{quality of}} a Herdwick has unique qualities {{relating}} to durability. Thick bristle type fibres <b>will</b> <b>often</b> protrude from garments forming a protective barrier layer in blizzards—most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions. They {{have been known to}} survive under a blanket of snow for three days while eating their own wool.|$|E

5|$|Usually very {{inquisitive}} {{and friendly}} birds, they <b>will</b> <b>often</b> invade a campsite, searching for edible items, including fruit, insects, and remnants from containers of jam or honey, and milk is particularly favoured. Parent birds feed the young on insects, fruit and nectar, {{and have been}} recorded regurgitating milk to them as well.|$|E
5|$|Young birds {{indulge in}} play fighting, and one bird <b>will</b> <b>often</b> lock {{the neck of}} another under its chin. The kakapo is curious by nature and {{has been known to}} {{interact}} with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo, which have distinct personalities.|$|E
5|$|A bulker's voyages are {{determined}} by market forces; routes and cargoes often vary. A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on a different route. Aboard a coastal carrier in the tramp trade, the crew <b>will</b> <b>often</b> not know the {{next port of call}} until the cargo is fully loaded.|$|E

5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It <b>will</b> <b>often</b> publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee <b>will</b> <b>often</b> hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands <b>will</b> <b>often</b> associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
5|$|Convention {{programming}} includes presentations, panels, {{workshops and}} tutorials on anthropomorphic culture, from literature, fiction and art to science, technology and spirituality. The convention <b>will</b> <b>often</b> provide space for stand-up comedy routines by entertainers like Uncle Kage and , filk music, {{many kinds of}} gaming, and roleplaying sessions, as well as numerous puppeteering and performing arts events. A unifying theme is common for larger events.|$|E
