40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of topical {{application}} of Andrographis paniculata on the rate of wound enclosure and its histological features. A wound was created in four groups of rat in posterior neck region. Blank placebo was applied topically to the wounds of Group 1. Groups 2 and 3 were dressed with placebo containing 5 % and 10 % extracts of A. paniculata, respectively. Intrasite gel was applied topically to the wounds of Group 4. Macroscopical examination revealed {{that the rate of}} wound healing was significantly accelerated in the <b>wound</b> <b>dressed</b> with A. paniculata extract compared to the blank placebo. The <b>wounds</b> <b>dressed</b> with 10 % extract or Intrasite gel healed earlier compared to the <b>wounds</b> <b>dressed</b> with placebo containing 5 % A. paniculata extract. Histologically, <b>wounds</b> <b>dressed</b> with A. paniculata extracts showed markedly less scar width and contained large amounts of fibroblast proliferation. More collagen and less angiogenesis with absence of inflammatory cells were seen for <b>wounds</b> <b>dressed</b> with 10 % A. paniculata compared to the blank placebo. Conclusion, A. paniculata extracts significantly enhanced rate of wound healing in rats. © 2012 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

25|$|The frontovik usually carried {{all he had}} in {{a simple}} bag. Most of the frontovik had a perevgzochnii paket (<b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> packet), a razor, a shovel and would be very {{lucky to have a}} towel and toothbrush. Toothpaste, shampoo and soap were {{extremely}} rare. Usually sticks with chewed ends were used for brushing teeth. To relieve themselves latrine pits were dug, as portable toilets were rare in the Red Army. Soldiers frequently slept outdoors, even during the winter. Food was usually abysmal and often in short supply, especially in 1941 and 1942. The frontoviks detested the rear service troops who did not face the dangers of combat as krysa (rats). The frontovik lived on a diet of black rye bread; canned meats like fish and tushonka (stewed pork); shchi (cabbage soup) and kasha (porridge).”. Kasha and shchi were so common that a popular slogan in the Red Army was “shchi ee kasha, pisha nasha” (“schchi and kasha, that's our fare.”). Chai (hot sugared tea) was an extremely popular beverage together with beer and vodka. Makhorka, a type of cheap tobacco roiled in handmade cigarettes was the standard cigarette.|$|E
500|$|Calvatia craniiformis, {{commonly}} known as the brain puffball or the skull-shaped puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. It is found in Asia, Australia, and North America, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Its name, derived from the same Latin root as cranium, alludes to its resemblance to an animal's brain. The skull-shaped fruit body is [...] broad by [...] tall and white to tan. Initially smooth, the skin (peridium) develops wrinkles and folds as it matures, cracking and flaking with age. The peridium eventually sloughs away, exposing a powdery yellow-brown to greenish-yellow spore mass (the gleba). The puffball is edible when the gleba is still white and firm, before it matures to become yellow-brown and powdery. Mature specimens have been used in the traditional or folk medicines of China, Japan, and the Ojibwe as a hemostatic or <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> agent. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the brain puffball.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legs of a}} horse require routine {{observation}} for lacerations or swelling. [...] Everyday care involves {{brushing the}} legs with a brush to remove dirt and mud. [...] A currycomb is generally not used below the knees. [...] It is common to have excess hair trimmed from the fetlock to prevent excess accumulation of mud and moisture {{that may lead to}} skin problems, such as rain rot or scratches. [...] Many riders wrap the horse's legs with protective boots or bandages to prevent injury while working or exercising. [...] After a ride, it is common for a rider or groom to hose off the legs of a horse to remove dirt and to ease any minor inflammation to the tendons and ligaments. [...] Liniment may also be applied as a preventative measure to minimize stiffness and ease any minor strain or swelling. [...] If the horse has been overworked, injured, or is to be transported, a standing bandage or shipping boot may be placed on the horse's legs for protection, to hold a <b>wound</b> <b>dressing,</b> or to provide support. [...] Leg wraps are useful in preventing injury or for treating horses with leg injuries. [...] Veterinarians may recommend using wraps during rehabilitation to prevent further injury. [...] Another common use for leg wraps is to protect the legs of horses while being shipped in a horse trailer.|$|E
2500|$|In {{more modern}} applications, {{microbial}} cellulose has become relevant {{in the medical}} sector. [...] It [...] has been tested and successfully used as a <b>wound</b> <b>dressing,</b> especially in burn cases. [...] Studies have shown that burns treated with microbial cellulose coverings healed faster than traditional treatments and had less scarring. [...] The microbial cellulose topical applications are effective due to the cellulose's water holding ability and water vapor permeability. [...] The high water holding ability provides a moist atmosphere at the injury site, which is critical in healing, while the wicking ability allows seepage from the wound {{to be removed from}} the site. [...] Also, the microbial cellulose molds very well {{to the surface of the}} skin, providing a conformal covering even in usually difficult places to dress wounds, such as areas on the face. [...] This technique has been so successful that commercial microbial cellulose products, such as Biofill ®, have been developed. [...] Another microbial cellulose commercial treatment product is XCell produced by the Xylos Corporation, which is mainly used to treat wounds from venous ulcers. [...] Studies have also been performed where traditional gauze dressings are treated with a microbial cellulose biopolymer to enhance the properties of the gauze. [...] In addition to increasing the drying time and water holding abilities, liquid medicines were able to be absorbed by the microbial cellulose coated gauze, allowing them to work at the injury site.|$|E
2500|$|With {{any large}} number of people being in close {{quarters}} there was a constant threat of disease. [...] When one individual in a large group gets sick with a communicable disease, it spreads to others very quickly. [...] This premise remains true even today in the modern military. [...] The Romans recognized the difference between disease and wounds, each requiring separate treatment. [...] Drainage of excess water and waste were common practices in camps as well as the permanent medical structures, which come at a later date. [...] As the medical corps grew in size there was also specialization evolving. Physicians surfaced that specialized in disease, surgery, <b>wound</b> <b>dressing</b> and even veterinary medicine. Veterinary physicians were there to tend to livestock for agricultural purposes as well as combat purposes. [...] The Cavalry was known for their use of horses in combat and scouting purposes. [...] Because of the type of injuries that would have been commonly seen, surgery was a somewhat common occurrence. [...] Tools such as scissors, knives and arrow extractors have been found in remains. [...] In fact, Roman surgery was quite intuitive, in contrast to common thought of ancient surgery. [...] The Roman military surgeons used a cocktail of plants, which created a sedative similar to modern anesthesia. [...] Written documentation also showed surgeons would use oxidation from metal such as copper and scrape it into wounds, which provided an antibacterial effect; however, this method was most likely more toxic than providing an actual benefit. [...] Doctors had the knowledge to clean their surgical instruments with hot water after each use. [...] Wounds were dressed, and dead tissue was removed when bandages were changed. [...] Honey and cobwebs were items used to cover wounds, and have even been shown today to increase healing. [...] Because of the wide array of cases, it was not uncommon for surgeons to begin their careers in the army to learn their trade. [...] Physicians such as Galen and Dioscorides served in the military. [...] Most major advancements in knowledge and technique came from the military rather than civil practice.|$|E
