5|$|Several {{plans were}} introduced, {{with the most}} {{important}} plan being that of James Madison (the Virginia Plan). The Convention's work was mostly a matter of modifying this plan. Charles Pinckney also introduced a plan, although this wasn't considered and its exact character has been lost to history. After the Convention was <b>well</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> the New Jersey Plan was introduced though never seriously considered. It was mainly a protest to what some delegates thought was the excessively radical change from the Articles of Confederation. Alexander Hamilton also offered a plan after the Convention was <b>well</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> though it included an executive serving for life and therefore the delegates felt it too closely resembled a monarchy. Historians are unsure how serious he was about this, and some have speculated {{that he may have}} done it to make Madison's plan look moderate by comparison. The Connecticut Compromise wasn't a plan but one of several compromises offered by the Connecticut delegation. It was key to the ultimate ratification of the constitution, but was only included after being modified by Benjamin Franklin {{in order to make it}} more appealing to larger states.|$|E

5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage.

50|$|Upon their arrival, the Spaniards {{immediately}} subjugated the Indians, {{forcing them}} to labor in mines and on farms, imposing virtual slavery, brutality, and rape, and confiscating their goods and lands. Following {{the era of the}} gold seekers, the missionizing process became a concerted and intense effort in Durango between 1607 and 1615. After the establishment of missions and the settlement of Indians in towns, the Spaniards built garrisons to protect their settlements and haciendas to farm and tend cattle. This encroachment was not passively received. Continuous trouble culminated in a bloody uprising from 1616 to 1618, the first large—and possibly the most devastating—Indian rebellion in the border regions in the seventeenth century. The Spanish settlement that is now Durango city came under siege, and there was fighting at Mezquital in the south and at Canatlán in the north. By early 1621, pacification was <b>well</b> enough <b>under</b> <b>way</b> to allow the Spanish appointment of forty-six Tepehuan political officers to govern the Indian communities. Although sporadic insurgency continued (raids on Spanish farms and ranches were common around Mezquital), the two decades that followed are seen as the time of conclusive efforts to quell significant resistance.|$|R
5|$|Another major {{influence}} {{in his work}} was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was <b>well</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T.A.Richardson and James Harrison and {{it came to be}} developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne {{took over}} as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in 1950. Browne {{preferred}} fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines for a while. He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and the quality declined. At the end of 1950, Ziff-Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result {{to have been a}} definite improvement in quality. Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest-sized magazine, Fantastic, in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well. The move from the pulp format to digests was <b>well</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> in the early 1950s, and with Fantastics success there was little reason to keep Fantastic Adventures going.

5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get <b>well</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E

5|$|In 1825, Jones wrote {{a letter}} to Indian Agent James Givins {{regarding}} the year's delivery of gifts (due from various land purchases) to the Mississaugas. The letter was the first Givins had received that had been written by an Indian. Givins arranged a meeting with Jones during the second week of July. Jones arrived at the Humber River at the prescribed time, leading the approximately 50 Christian Indians, and his former adoptive father Captain Jim arrived leading the approximately 150 non-Christian Indians. At this meeting, a further 50 of the approximately 200 Indians of Jones' band were converted. Givins was accompanied by several members of Upper Canada's aristocracy, including Bishop John Strachan. The Christian dress and style of Jones' band of converts, including their singing of hymns, which had been translated into Ojibwe by Jones, created a favourable impression of the group with Strachan and the other political leaders present. Although Strachan, an Anglican, had strongly denounced the Methodists, he saw in Jones the opportunity to Christianize the Indians of Upper Canada. He hoped to convert Jones (and thereby his followers) to Anglicanism later. The Crown had previously agreed to build a village on the Credit River for the Mississaugas in 1820, but nothing had been done. Strachan told Jones he would make good on this agreement, and after a short meeting, all of the Christian Indians agreed to accept it. Construction of the settlement, called the Credit Mission, was soon underway and Jones moved there in 1826. By the summer of 1826, with construction of the settlement <b>well</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> the rest of the band had joined the Methodist church and settled at the Credit Mission. Among the last holdouts was Jones' former adoptive father, Captain Jim, and his family. At about this time Methodist Reverend Egerton Ryerson was assigned to the Credit Mission, and Jones quickly struck up a friendship with him. Ryerson's work at the camp freed Jones to begin taking lengthy missionary expeditions to other parts of Upper Canada. During the period 182527, Jones undertook missionary missions to Quinte, Munceytown, Rice Lake and Lake Simcoe. He preached in the native language, a key factor to helping the Indians understand and accept Christianity; small groups of Indians in these areas soon converted to Christianity.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to reprogramme human stem cells into hepatocytes in a robust and scalable manner for clinical and industrial applications. Hepatocytes are the parenchymal cells {{that make up the}} majority of the liver. The shortage of hepatocytes and difficulty in maintaining primary hepatocytes will remain key obstacles that must be overcome by researchers before hepatocyte transplantation can be used in clinical trials. Stem cells possess the unique ability to differentiate into any cell type in our body. In addition, they possess the ability to self-renew, meaning, they can act as a renewable source of hepatocytes. Thus, the goal is to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hES) to hepatocyes using cytokines and growth factors (GFs). Cytokines and growth factors were used in the past to mimic embryonic liver development, thus, the goal of this project is to advance a step further and to mimic adult liver development. The difficulty in this system is to translate adherent stem cell culture to a suspension culture that better suits their optimal culture environment. In this project, the focus will primarily be on the differentiation of human stem cells to hepatocytes. After rigorous cell culturing and data collection, it has been found that on day 10 of differentiation, the cells were <b>well</b> <b>under</b> their <b>way</b> of developing as hepatocytes, however they did not show target results for each gene expression tested for.

40|$|The Malaysian {{palm oil}} sector has been pegged by the Malaysian Government {{to be one}} of the focus areas for {{consolidation}} and restructuring in 2003. The Government’s aims are simple: 1) To create the world’s largest oil palm plantation company thereby leveraging economies of scale and hopefully become an efficient model for others to follow, 2) To enhance investors’ interest and increase tradability of the stock, and 3) To spearhead efforts in creating large capitalisation stock. As a result of this, recent events indicate that activities towards this aim may <b>well</b> be <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> Plans to merge PNB-owned plantation companies and the listing of FELDA on the KLSE have raised speculation and interest.

The aim of this study is to analyse the effects of market structure components and other performance measures to better understand the dynamics and determinants of financial performance for firms within the Malaysian palm oil sector. Emphasis in this study directed toward understanding the effects of firm size and firm ownership on financial performance, which is proxied by profitability. The study disproves the classical notion that ‘big equals better’. Firm size was shown to have an inverse relationship with financial performance. Further, it was found that privately-owned firms outperform state-owned firms in the Malaysian palm oil sector. These outcomes have far reaching implications that contest the viability of the Malaysian Government’s current initiatives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{reallocation of labour}} {{during the}} transition period, which is argued not only to ease {{the transition from a}} planned to market orientated economy, but also to be fundamental to the successful integration of Poland into the European Union. Labour force survey data is used to gauge the overall level of reallocation during the period 1994 - 1998, a period in which the transition process is considered to be <b>well</b> and truly <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> The results obtained illustrate the inherent immobility prevailing in the Polish labour market during this period and would appear to suggest the presence of relatively significant structural rigidities in the labour market. It is argued that mobility rates of this magnitude are likely to result in considerable strains being placed on the Polish economy when it enters the European Union and could, over the medium term, result in relatively high levels of unemployment. Unless mobility is stimulated, European accession is therefore likely to be a socially costly process. The microeconometric analysis of the determinants of individual mobility presented {{in the second part of}} the paper offers a first step to identifying the demographic, economic and social attributes which either aid or inhibit effective labour reallocation. The results obtained highlight a number of important differences in mobility behaviour across age, gender, educational attainment, occupational grouping and labour market experience, which will need to be taken into account in the formulation of active labour market policies to stimulate individual mobility.
