5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater <b>wrong</b> <b>is</b> women's lack of independence. Because they are unable to find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E

We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave <b>wrong</b> <b>is</b> committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{measure of}} {{compensation}} {{due to a}} plaintiff whose goods have been wrongfully converted may be merely nominal if the <b>wrong</b> <b>is</b> technical and the defendant can return the goods; it may {{be limited to the}} actual damage where the goods can be returned, but the <b>wrong</b> <b>is</b> substantial; but in ordinary cases it is the full value to the owner of the goods of which he has been deprived.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wrongs</b> <b>are</b> also of {{two kinds}} {{and they are}} either public or private.

This difference forms the distinction between criminal law (regarding crime) and civil law (regarding torts).|$|R

25|$|The {{input-output}} equations {{could be}} made to work, only if additional assumptions were made. But even in a dynamic model, it can be shown mathematically that assumptions (1), (3) and (4) have a crippling effect on the plausibility of longterm quantitative results obtained with the model. However, what ought to be concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions <b>wrong,</b> <b>is</b> the interpretation of the concepts <b>wrong,</b> <b>is</b> there a big difference between the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and how we could know that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} scholarly {{discussion of}} sati, {{whether it is}} right or <b>wrong,</b> <b>is</b> found in the Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on sati by Medhatithi of Kashmir argues that sati {{is a form of}} suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijnanesvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against sati.|$|E
25|$|Conversion, as {{a purely}} civil <b>wrong,</b> <b>is</b> {{distinguishable}} from both theft and unjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft {{will also be}} conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from unjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, {{the person who has}} another's property may always raise a change of position defense, to say they have unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there always must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights.|$|E

Daenerys offers both men the chance to make amends by sneaking into Meereen to free the slaves and start an uprising. Meereen soon falls and, in retaliation for the murdered child slaves, Daenerys has the city's rulers put to death. Selmy asks for Daenerys' forgiveness and becomes Lord Commander of her Queensguard while Jorah, who refuses to admit any <b>wrong,</b> <b>is</b> banished. When Daenerys learns that the council she left in Astapor has been overthrown, she decides to rule Meereen to practice for the rule of Westeros.|$|E
25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder <b>wrong</b> <b>is</b> {{not just the}} deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future that one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest {{in his or her}} future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does in fact desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E
500|$|In chapter seven, Cochrane {{approaches}} {{issues relating}} to animals and the environment. He first argues {{for the importance of}} this kind of analysis, before saying that, under the interest-based rights approach, non-conscious entities (including species, ecosystems and plants) cannot be understood to have rights; he then defends the necessity of consciousness for the possession of interests. Cochrane considers, but rejects, the land ethic of Aldo Leopold as a basis for the moral status of the environment, but instead defends the environment on welfare grounds. Though he rejects the notion that wild animals might own the land on which they live, Cochrane concludes that we have strict environmental obligations due to the rights and interests of sentient animals. Concerning endangered species, Cochrane rejects the notion of [...] "superkilling" [...] (that a special <b>wrong</b> <b>is</b> involved in wiping out a species) and the idea of [...] "compensatory justice" [...] (that more is owed to members of endangered species as a form of compensation). Instead, Cochrane argues that unconscious species may have contingent value, and members of rare conscious species may have a stronger right to life due to the interests of humans who will want to see them and the interests of other animals in their ecosystems Cochrane then argues that animals possess a concrete right not to be killed in order to preserve a favoured ecosystem, whether because of overpopulation of the species or because species are nonnative. However, control by contraception is argued to be acceptable.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it <b>wrong</b> <b>is</b> great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a [...] "brilliant episode from start to finish". He commented that [...] "We see what an amazing amount {{of goods and services}} one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode [...] "typically inspired", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: [...] "And just when you think the Simpsons creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a [...] "classic". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a [...] "fan" [...] of the episode's second half: [...] "Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste". He thought the first part was [...] "absolutely brilliant", though.|$|E
500|$|In Buddhist texts {{further details}} {{are given in}} what way {{and to what extent}} a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual {{attitude}} of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given. If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a [...] (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order. If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions. Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered <b>wrong,</b> <b>is</b> not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually [...] "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around. Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit. Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose. The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard {{to the size of the}} gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size. It is therefore recommended to give as much as you can afford, no more and no less. Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (...) [...]|$|E
