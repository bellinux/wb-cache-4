5|$|By convention, {{the game}} pieces {{are divided into}} <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> sets, and the players are {{referred}} to as <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Black</b> respectively. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E
5|$|Magic is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Black</b> magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character may learn only three spells per level. <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Black</b> Mages can potentially learn any of their respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (1) cal-culate age-specific and age-adjusted cause-specific mor-tality rates for Arab Americans; and (2) compare these rates with those for <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> Mortality rates were estimated using Michigan death certificate data, an Arab surname and first name list, and 2000 U. S. Census data. Age-specific rates, age-adjusted all-cause and cause-spe-cific rates were calculated. Arab Americans (75 ?) had higher mortality rates than <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> Among men, all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for Arab Americans were in the range of <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> How-ever, Arab American men had lower mortality rates from cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease compared to both <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> Among women, Arab Americans had lower mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, stroke, <b>and</b> diabetes than <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> Arab Americans are growing in number. Future study should focus on designing rigorous separate analyses for this population...|$|R

5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Black</b> against each opponent.|$|E

40|$|PurposeWe {{compared}} the nutrient profiles of hypertensive Korean-Americans, non-Hispanic <b>Whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blacks</b> {{with those of}} normotensive Korean-Americans, <b>Whites,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blacks.</b> MethodsThis study was a cross-sectional comparative design of nutrient profiles among three ethnic groups. Korean-Americans were interviewed at Korean-American health clinics and churches in Chicago and data were collected by the 24 -hour dietary recall method. Age- and sex-matched data of non-Hispanic <b>Whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blacks</b> were selected from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for comparison. Descriptive statistics, one way ANOVA with post hoc test, and the propensity score matching method within each hypertensive and normotensive group were used for data analysis. Subjects included 102 subjects with hypertension (Korean-Americans, n = 37; Whites, n = 37; Blacks, n = 28), and 149 subjects without hypertension (Korean-Americans, n = 55; Whites, n = 55; Blacks, n = 39) for final statistical analyses. ResultsSignificant differences in nutrient profiles among the three groups were as follows. In both hypertensive and normotensive groups, Korean-Americans consumed less energy from fat and saturated fatty acids and more energy from carbohydrates than did <b>Whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blacks.</b> All three ethnic groups exceeded the dietary reference intakes of sodium, but did not meet those of calcium and potassium. ConclusionThe findings suggest that protein {{may be needed to}} replace excessive carbohydrate intake in Korean-Americans and to replace fat intake in <b>Whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blacks.</b> Health professionals need to emphasize the importance of increasing calcium and potassium intake and decreasing sodium intake in their nutrition education for these ethnic groups to help prevent and control hypertension...|$|R
