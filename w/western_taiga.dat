40|$|Natura 2000 {{is part of}} the European Union: s {{framework}} to protect and preserve biological diversity. Natura 2000 - areas are by the goverment appointed to areas of national interest for preserving nature. Also wind power stations are appointed as of national interest and {{the reason for this is}} the goverments goal to get energy from reneweble energysources. This essay describes when both these intrests conflict eachother when it comes to building wind power stations within Natura 2000 - areas. The main focus of this essay is a casestudy of two cases from two different counties, Dalarna- and Norrbotten county, where applications have been made to build wind power stations within existing Natura 2000 - ares, both cases have reached the court dealing with enviromental issues. In Dalarna county the court dealing with enviromental issues said no to the application and in Norrbotten the court said yes but in both cases simular factors seem to have been determining the outcome. For instance seem the Natura 2000 protection to be of minor consideration and rather what kind of habitats and biotopes that could be damaged in case of putting up a wind power station park and how these habitats and biotopes would be affected seems to have been the main focus. In Dalarna county the area is consisting to onehundered percent of the priority biotope <b>western</b> <b>taiga</b> and in Norrbotten the area holds different types of biotopes of which some are counted as prioritied biotopes. The amount of energy produced have also been in focus when judgement have been made in the two cases. The fact that both wind power stations and Natura 2000 are of national interest seem to have been of no consideration and the conflict between these two interests does not seem to have been in focus in the two cases...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{carried out}} in the Kola {{peninsula}} (northern taiga) and in the South-western part of <b>Western</b> Siberia (southern <b>taiga</b> and forest-steppe) revealed identical course of the postfire restoration process of forest litter thickness in Scots pine forests. Despite the differences in mean annual temperature (2 °C) and other climatic characteristics the recovery time for thickness of forest litter in both regions amounts to 90 – 100 years after fire in pine forests of lichen site type and 120 – 140 years – in green moss type; the thickness of forest litter therewith corresponds 3 – 4 cm and 7 – 8 cm respectively. That means that within the natural borders of pine forests, communities of a specific type possess uniform characteristics of restoration. On the basis of empirical data it appears that the predicted increase of mean annual temperature of earth surface by (2 °C) will not bring changes into the character of postfire recovery of forest litter thickness. It was shown that during the period of the recovery, which spans about 90 years after fire in pine forests of lichen and green moss–lichen site types and 140 years in ones of green moss site types, the rate of increasing of carbon store in the forest litter averaged 0. 6 t ha– 1 year– 1, 0. 1 t ha– 1 year– 1 and 0. 2 t ha– 1 year– 1, respectively.

40|$|The {{exchange}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) between the atmosphere and a forest after disturbance by wind throw in the <b>western</b> Russian <b>taiga</b> was investigated between July and October 1998 using the eddy covariance technique. The research area was a regenerating forest (400 m x 1000 m), in which all trees of the preceding generation were uplifted during a storm in 1996. All deadwood had remained on site after the storm and had not been extracted for commercial purposes. Because of the heterogeneity of the terrain, several micrometeorological quality tests were applied. In addition to the eddy covariance measurements, carbon pools of decaying wood in a chronosequence of three different wind throw areas were analysed and the decay rate of coarse woody debris was derived. During daytime, the average CO 2 uptake flux was - 3 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1), whereas during night-time characterised by a well-mixed atmosphere the rates of release were typically about 6 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1). Suppression of turbulent fluxes was only observed under conditions with very low friction velocity (u * {{less than or equal}} to 0. 08 ms(- 1)). On average, 164 mmol CO 2 m(- 2) d(- 1) was released from the wind throw to the atmosphere, giving a total of 14. 9 mol CO 2 m(- 2) (180 g CO 2 m(- 2)) released during the 3 -month study period. The chronosequence of dead woody debris on three different wind throw areas suggested exponential decay with a decay coefficient of - 0. 04 yr(- 1). From the magnitude of the carbon pools and the decay rate, it is estimated that the decomposition of coarse woody debris accounted for about a third of the total ecosystem respiration at the measurement site. Hence, coarse woody debris had a long- term influence on the net ecosystem {{exchange of}} this wind throw area. From the analysis performed in this work, a conclusion is drawn that it is necessary to include into flux networks the ecosystems that are subject to natural disturbances and that have been widely omitted into considerations of the global carbon budget. The half-life time of about 17 years for deadwood in the wind throw suggests a fairly long storage of carbon in the ecosystem, and indicates a very different long- term carbon budget for naturally disturbed vs. commercially managed forests...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePollen {{and plant}} macrofossil data from {{northern}} Eurasia {{were used to}} reconstruct the vegetation of the last glacial maximum (LGM: 18, 000 +/- 2000 C- 14 yr BP) using an objective quantitative method for interpreting pollen data {{in terms of the}} biomes they represent (Prentice Et al., 1996). The results confirm previous qualitative vegetation reconstructions at the LGM but provide a more comprehensive analysis of the data. Tundra dominated a large area of northern Eurasia (north of 57 degreesN) to the west, south and east of the Scandinavian ice sheet at the LGM. Steppe-like vegetation was reconstructed in the latitudinal band from western Ukraine, where temperate deciduous forests grow today, to <b>western</b> Siberia, where <b>taiga</b> and cold deciduous forests grow today. The reconstruction shows that steppe graded into tundra in Siberia, which is not the case today. Taiga grew on the northern coast of the Sea of Azov, about 1500 km south of its present limit in European Russia. In contrast, taiga was reconstructed only slightly south of its southern limit today in south-western Siberia. Broadleaved trees were confined to small refuges, e. g. on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, where cool mixed forest was reconstructed from the LGM data. Cool conifer forests in western Georgia were reconstructed as growing more than 1000 m lower than they grow today. The few scattered sites with LGM data from the Tien-Shan Mountains and from northern Mongolia yielded biome reconstructions of steppe and taiga, which are the biomes growing there today...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{correlation}} coefficients with monthly temperature showed stronger negative, sometimes significant {{values for the}} birches, younger trees in particular. It is unlikely that birch is less well adapted to the dry and sometimes hot steppe conditions as this species populates the most southern outposts of all tree species of the Northern Mongolian steppe forests (Otoda et al. 2013; Gradel et al. 2017), notably in areas where larch have trouble surviving. The strong negative correlation of birch growth with temperatures in May (peak fire season) {{proved to be the}} most significant difference in Altansumber (Gradel et al. 2017) compared to the non-significant relationships drawn from our own larch chronology. We also observed differences in the growth performance between larch and birch growing in Altansumber. The growth performance and production of larch were clearly higher than those of birch in the same area (compared with Gradel et al. 2017). The mean width of tree-rings for the larch was 1.72 mm ± 1.45 (SD) and 0.26 (SE) compared to 1.18 mm ± 0.8 (SD) and 0.17 (SE) for the young birches (average age of 30 years) and 1.03 mm ± 0.74 (SD) and 0.18 (SE) for the old birch trees (average age of 72 years) (Gradel et al. 2017). A very similar scenario was observed in fire-disturbed sites of mixed birch-pine stands on largely south-facing slopes of the <b>western</b> Khentey Mountains (<b>taiga</b> zone; Bugant). Data from dendrochronological examinations conducted for mean annual ring growth showed an average of 1.94 mm ± 0.61 SD for the pine trees, and 1.13 mm ± 0.59 SD for same old birch trees within the same stand (Haensch 2015). Competitive status for both species were similar. The significant negative correlation of birch growth with temperatures in April (peak fires season) proved to be the most significant difference of the climate-growth relations between the two species. No significant temperature-growth relations were found for the pine trees (Haensch 2015). This means that the comparison of temperature-growth relationships for pine and birch showed an analogous scenario resembling previously outlined relationships between larch and birch. It is worth noting, however, that an important difference between the two species was the degree of fire damage sustained on lower stems: birch trees exhibited signs of having suffered as much as eight times more fire damage than the thick barked pine trees within the same stand (Gradel et al. 2015 a). Fire can damage the phloem and consequently affect transport of photoassimilates throughout a tree (Lüttge et al. 2005). Damage to the cambium can affect production and slow radial growth. While most trees are able to survive fire damage, the secondary effects can {{have a negative effect on}} growth performance for several years following. The average fire return interval in the western Khentey pine-birch forest was found to be only around 11.6 years (Oyunsanaa 2011).|$|R
