5|$|The {{revolution}} of May 1810 in Buenos Aires, intended {{to win the}} independence of Argentina from Spain, also had the consequence of emancipating the province of Buenos Aires from Argentina or, rather, of imposing the authority of this province upon the <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> emancipated from Spain. That day, Spanish power over the Argentine provinces ended and that of Buenos Aires was established.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Nehemiah, the Ashdodites seem to {{represent}} the <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> of the Philistines in the sixth century BCE, the speech of Ashdod (which half of the children from mixed families are described as adopting) would simply be the general Philistine dialect. Hugo Winckler explains {{the use of that}} name by the fact that Ashdod was the nearest of the Philistine cities to Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|The {{fears of}} {{terrorism}} received an extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{could call}} the <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If {{the right of}} conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, the Federation of Australia was {{the process}} by which the six {{separate}} British self-governing colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the <b>whole</b> <b>nation.</b> When the Constitution of Australia came into force, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.|$|E

This, I think, is an error.|$|E

The river Kaveri and its tributaries dominate this landscape of generally flat country that gradually slopes towards the sea, unbroken by major hills or valleys. The river, which {{is also known as}} the Ponni (Golden) river, had a special place in the culture of Cholas. The annual floods in the Kaveri marked an occasion for celebration, known as Adiperukku, in which the <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> took part.|$|E

The system was the third tropical cyclone to affect the island nation in 10 months, after Cyclone's Hina and Keli affected the islands during March and June 1997. Ahead of the system affecting the islands tropical cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for the <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> by the Tonga Meteorological Department. The worst affected Tongan island was Niuafo'ou where considerable damage occurred, while some damage was reported on other islands including Niuatoputapu, Tafahi, and Vava'u.|$|E
25|$|After the Kalmar War {{broke out}} in 1611, the Danish king tried to revive the {{volunteer}} leidang, with dire results. As the Norwegian citizenry had not been armed or trained {{in the use of}} arms for nearly three centuries they were not able to fight. Soldiers deserted or were captured. The soldiers had to participate in military drills, while providing supplementary labor to the local community when not in active service. Although the army still did not represent the <b>whole</b> <b>nation,</b> as city residents were exempt from military duty, 1628 is generally regarded by historians as the year when the modern Norwegian army was born.|$|E

Between 1925 and 1929 a power {{struggle}} {{took place in the}} new organization between Yaroslavsky and his followers, and the leadership of the former Moscow group (Galaktionov, Polidorov, Kostelovskaia, Lunin and others). The 1926 All-Union Conference on Antireligious Propaganda voted in favour of Yaroslavsky's views on the antireligious campaign, but the debate still continued. The Moscow group argued that the antireligious struggle should be led only by the party and the industrial proletariat, as opposed to the <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> which Yaroslavsky wanted to mobilize to conduct the antireligious campaign.|$|E
25|$|Richelieu's tenure was {{a crucial}} period of reform for France. Earlier, the nation's {{political}} structure was largely feudal, with powerful nobles and {{a wide variety of}} laws in different regions. Parts of the nobility periodically conspired against the King, raised private armies, and allied themselves with foreign powers. This system gave way to centralized power under Richelieu. Local and even religious interests were subordinated to those of the <b>whole</b> <b>nation,</b> and of the embodiment of the nation — the King. Equally critical for France was Richelieu's foreign policy, which helped restrain Habsburg influence in Europe. Richelieu did not survive {{to the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. However, the conflict ended in 1648, with France emerging in a far better position than any other power, and the Holy Roman Empire entering a period of decline.|$|E
