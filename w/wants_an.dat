40|$|Since 1990, migrant Australians' {{attitudes to}} {{immigration}} have waned and waxed {{according to the}} same overall pattern {{as those of the}} Australia-born. However, migrants are consistently less likely to <b>want</b> <b>a</b> decrease in the intake and consistently (slightly) more likely to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase. This is particularly true of those born in non-English-speaking-background (NESB) countries. Even so, in 2004, only 26 per cent of NESB-born Australians <b>wanted</b> <b>an</b> increase in immigration. Migrants are also likely to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in immigration from their own region of origin. But the stand-out group here are the British. UK-born Australians {{are much more likely to}} <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in British immigration than are Asia-born Australians to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in Asian immigration or Southern-Europe-born Australians to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in Southern European immigration. When we focus on regions within New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, the differences between the Australia-born and the NESB-born in their attitudes to immigration in general are marked. But in no instance do a majority of the NESB-born <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in immigration...|$|R

25|$|Luke is {{revealed}} to be keeping secret that the drug therapy is only a temporary solution, and Laura will eventually return to her catatonic state. Lulu is able to convince her cousin Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) to postpone her marriage to Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), allowing her parents to use the supplies already in place. On November 16, 2006, Luke and Laura remarry on their 25th wedding anniversary. A drunken Tracy has {{to be removed from}} the ceremony, and scheming Maxie manages to sneak into the ceremony and catch Laura's bouquet, much like Scott had 25 years before. On November 20, Luke reveals that Laura's illness is no longer mental but physical and she will soon revert to her catatonic state. Laura decides she <b>wants</b> <b>an</b> early Christmas as she may not be around for the real one, and is able to comfort Lulu when she reveals the truth about her abortion. When Luke arrives with the tree, Laura is confused, confirming that her catatonia is returning. After being escorted back to the asylum, Laura reveals to her daughter that she doesn't think she really killed Rick Webber and asks her to prove her innocence. After saying goodbye to her family, Laura returns to her chair and sits with Luke as he tearfully watches her slip back into silence.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins in}} a Los Angeles diner where a {{waitress}} named Slim (Jennifer Lopez) works with her best friend, Ginny (Juliette Lewis). She receives unwelcome romantic advances from Robbie, a customer who teases {{her about her}} name. Another man in the diner, Mitch Hiller (Billy Campbell), reveals that the customer had made a bet {{that he would be}} able to convince Slim to sleep with him. Soon after, Slim falls in love with and marries Mitch, and they have a child named Gracie (Tessa Allen). Years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her with a French woman named Darcelle. She confronts him and he admits it, but also insisting Darcelle means nothing to him. Slim becomes angry and threatens to leave, which enrages Mitch, who becomes violent, slapping and punching her in the face. He gives her a warning, saying that he makes the money and gets to do whatever he likes, implying he <b>wants</b> <b>an</b> open marriage. Mitch refuses to stop his affair unless she wants to fight him. The next day, Slim confides in Mitch's mother (Janet Carroll); she asks Slim what she did to make Mitch angry, implying he has a history of physical abuse. Ginny advises Slim to leave and imprison Mitch, but Slim does not want to hurt Gracie. She then goes to pick up Gracie from school, only to discover Mitch had already picked her up. Panicked that Mitch might have left town with her, she calls Mitch, who tells her that he took Gracie to the zoo.|$|E

Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "the show isn't as retro-stylish as it thinks it is ... the first hour of Agent Carter feels like an above-average episode of Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", noting that it tonally aims for His Girl Friday, Dick Tracy, and Alias ("A tough tonal mixture on a weekly broadcast budget, but also an ambition worth pursuing"), but praised Atwell's performance, calling her [...] "a delight" [...] and [...] "firing on all cylinders". Franich was negative about what he saw to be common MCU tropes, notably [...] "Somebody named Stark invented something dangerous; everyone <b>wants</b> <b>an</b> All-Important Glowing Thing; there's an implicit promise that nothing will be solved for weeks/years to come." [...] Though he was wary about the series being forced {{to contribute to the}} rest of the MCU, he did note that [...] "Agent Carter feels pleasantly segmented off from the greater Marvel Machinery".|$|E

She starts seeing a psychiatrist in the episode [...] "Born This Way", and is showing signs of improvement by the end of season two.
