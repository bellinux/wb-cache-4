25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced unsprung weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One wheel changes, the spanner would then retain the <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|E
2500|$|Large-volume users (such as auto makers) {{frequently}} use computer-controlled nut drivers. With such machines, {{the computer}} in effect plots a graph of the torque exerted. Once the torque reaches a set maximum torque chosen by the designer, the machine stops.

2500|$|A perimetric (and {{optional}} volumetric) alarm, {{engine immobiliser}} and remote-control central locking with deadbolts are standard equipment on the 75. Alloy wheels are fitted with locking <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts.</b> Automatic locking when driving off is standard, {{but can be}} disabled by a dealer. On the inside is a master locking switch and the boot can only be opened by remote control or an interior button. [...] A battery back-up sounder and tracking device called Trackstar were available as options.|$|E
40|$|A failed <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{belonging}} to an aircraft {{was sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> failed in progressive manner wherein a number of cracks had initiated all along the circumference of the nut at the fillet of the flange. Fractographic features indicated that the reason for the progressive failure was hydrogen embrittlement and it appears most probable that the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> would have picked up hydrogen during cadmium plating. In general, the microstructure of the nut material was found to be satisfactory and the composition was found to conform to the specification. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this repor...|$|R

2500|$|During the 2007 Geneva Auto Show Lamborghini debuted the Gallardo Superleggera. The name {{paid tribute}} to the {{construction}} style of the first Lamborghini production model, the 350GT, designed and built by Carrozzeria Touring and its emphasis on weight reduction. The Superleggera was lighter than the base Gallardo by [...] via the use of carbon fibre panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was upgraded by [...] thanks to an improved intake, exhaust and ECU {{for a total of}} [...] The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2016 Farage told The Mail on Sunday that he {{believed}} his car had been tampered with in October 2015, {{as he had been}} forced to stop when his car's <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> came loose. He reported that he had spoken with the French police but did not wish to pursue the matter any further. The Times, however, said Farage's story was untrue, and that Dunkirk prosecutors had no reason to suspect foul play or the police would have started an investigation. The owner of the breakdown garage concerned had said the problem was probably shoddy repair work, but he had been unable to communicate directly with Farage. Farage later said he had made a [...] "terrible, terrible mistake" [...] in speaking to journalists and that a Sunday newspaper had wrongly turned his claims of tampering into an assassination attempt.|$|E
2500|$|Boutsen left Williams {{and joined}} Ligier {{at the start}} of the [...] season. His {{replacement}} was a returning Nigel Mansell, who had spent the previous two seasons driving for Scuderia Ferrari. Williams also recruited future 1996 world champion, Damon Hill, as one of their new test drivers. Williams failed to finish in the first Grand Prix of the season at Phoenix, both drivers retiring with gearbox problems. Patrese got back on track for the team in the next Grand Prix at Interlagos, coming second behind McLaren's Ayrton Senna. The 1991 San Marino Grand Prix saw both cars retiring again: Mansell after a collision and Patrese with an electrical failure after 17 laps. The Grand Prix at Monaco saw Mansell finish in a points-scoring position, coming second, 18 seconds behind Ayrton Senna. At the next race, the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, Williams locked out the front row only for Patrese to drop back with gearbox problems and Mansell to retire from the lead on the final lap with an electrical fault. At the following race, in Mexico, Williams achieved a 1–2, Patrese finishing ahead of Mansell to score 16 points for the Williams team. Williams then ran a streak of victories, with Mansell winning the French Grand Prix, five seconds ahead of Alain Prost's Ferrari. Mansell then won again at the British Grand Prix; it had been four years since a Briton had won the grand prix, Mansell having won it in 1987. Three consecutive victories became four when Mansell won again in Germany, with Patrese about 10 seconds behind him in second place. Senna ended Williams's run of victories by winning in Hungary, finishing five seconds ahead of Mansell. Mansell later won the Italian Grand Prix and the Spanish Grand Prix, while Patrese won the Portuguese Grand Prix after Mansell's race was ruined by a botched pitstop in which only three <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> were fitted. Williams finished second in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 125 points in total, 14 points behind McLaren. Mansell finished second in the Drivers' Championship with 72 points, 24 points behind Senna.|$|E
50|$|Loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators}} are small pointed tags, usually made of fluorescent orange or yellow plastic, which are {{fixed to the}} lug <b>nuts</b> of the <b>wheels</b> of large vehicles. The tag rotates with the nut, and if the nut becomes loose, {{the point of the}} tag shifts noticeably out of alignment with the other tags. If too many lug nuts are loosened, the wheel can detach from the wheel stud; loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> indicators allow identification of loose nuts before this can occur.|$|R

5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank bolt spanner or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} box wrench or ring spanner used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|E
