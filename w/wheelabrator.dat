50|$|In wheel blasting, a {{spinning}} wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation {{because there is}} no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, cut wire, grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a cryogenic chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and rubber components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted {{as well as on the}} expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by <b>Wheelabrator</b> in 1932.|$|E
5000|$|Montrone Hall {{is named}} in honor of Sandra Montrone H'03 and Paul Montrone '62, H'86. A magna cum laude {{graduate}} of The University of Scranton and native of this city, Mr. Montrone distinguished himself as a student in academics and as leader on campus. After college, Mr. Motrone went on to earn a doctorate from Columbia University, and served as chairman, president & CEO of Fisher Scientific International Inc. until its merger with Thermo Electron Corporation to form Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Mr. Montrone has directed the development of other public and private companies, including the Signal Companies, Inc., and its successor Allied Signal, Inc.; the Henley Group; <b>Wheelabrator</b> Technologies Inc.; Latona Associates; the Metropolitan Opera; Liberty Lane Partners Inc.; and Perspecta Trust LLC. During the Clinton administration, Mr. Montrone served {{as a member of the}} President’s Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Healthcare Industry, as well as a founder of the National Forum for Healthcare Quality Measurement and Reporting. In addition to an honorary degree, the university has recognized Mr. Montrone as a recipient of the President’s Medal in 2003. Mrs. Montrone, a graduate of Marywood College and also a native of Scranton, serves as president of The Penates Foundation, was a founding director and later president of the board of directors of Seacoast Hospice, which earned national recognition when it was selected as a distinguished service organization by the United Nations and a Point of Light by the first President Bush, and, under President Clinton, she served on the President’s Advisory Committee on the Arts. In recognition of the Montrone’s great accomplishments and to commemorate their generosity towards the University of Scranton, one of the Mulberry Street apartment complexes was named after them.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work {{was supported by}} SNECMA {{as part of the}} MAIA ([URL] article= 2 &lang=) project, the Region Champagne-Ardennes and Sisson Lehmann of the <b>Wheelabrator</b> group. In order to tackle a continuous improvement of virtual engineering, product modelling has to integrate more knowledge that refers to every decision taken during the product development process. Those decisions have {{to be related to the}} assessment of the whole product life cycle. This paper particularly addresses the domain of product’s industrialisation that aims at selecting the manufacturing processes. This selection must currently be done as soon as possible and has to be strongly linked with product definition and computer aided design (CAD) modelling. Thiswork first presents some new results concerning a product–process interface to integrate manufacturing information in the product model and how it leads to the definition of the CAD model. Then this interface that also manages specific information coming from the manufacturing process (tolerances, stresses gradient…) is used to improve the wholemanufacturing process plan simulation. This process plan has, indeed, to track every material transformation issued from each manufacturing operation...|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{surfaces}} {{contaminated with}} radionuclides present a significant challenge during the decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) process. As structures undergo D and D, coating layers and/or surface {{layers of the}} concrete containing the contaminants must be removed for disposal {{in such a way}} as to present little to no risk to human health or the environment. The selection of a concrete decontamination technology that is safe, efficient, and cost-effective is critical to the successful D and D of contaminated sites. To support U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Management objectives and to assist DOE site managers in the selection of the best-suited concrete floor decontamination technology(s) for a given site, two innovative and three baseline technologies have been assessed under standard, non-nuclear conditions at the Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU). The innovative technologies assessed include the Pegasus Coating Removal System and Textron's Electro-Hydraulic Scabbling System. The three baseline technologies assessed include: the <b>Wheelabrator</b> Blastrac model 1 - 15 D, the NELCO Porta Shot Blast{trademark} model GPx- 1 O- 18 HO Rider, and the NELCO Porta Shot Blast{trademark} model EC- 7 - 2. These decontamination technology assessments provide directly comparable performance data that have previously been available for only a limited number of technologies under restrictive site-specific constraints. Some of the performance data collected during these technology assessments include: removal capability, production rate, removal gap, primary and secondary waste volumes, and operation and maintenance requirements. The performance data generated by this project is intended to assist DOE site managers in the selection of the safest, most efficient, and cost-effective decontamination technologies to accomplish their remediation objectives...|$|E
