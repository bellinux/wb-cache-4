60|$|SOCIALISM {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{by most of}} its champions chiefly {{as a means of}} increasing the welfare of the <b>wage</b> <b>earning</b> <b>classes,</b> and more particularly their material welfare. It has seemed accordingly, to some men whose aims are not material, as if it has nothing to offer toward the general advancement of civilization in the way of art and thought. Some of its advocates, moreover--and among these Marx must be included--have written, no doubt not deliberately, as if with the Socialist revolution the millennium would have arrived, {{and there would be no}} need of further progress for the human race. I do not know whether our age is more restless than that which preceded it, or whether it has merely become more impregnated with the idea of evolution, but, for whatever reason, we have grown incapable of believing in a state of static perfection, and we demand, of any social system, which is to have our approval, that it shall contain within itself a stimulus and opportunity for progress toward something still better. The doubts thus raised by Socialist writers make it necessary to inquire whether Socialism would in fact be hostile to art and science, and whether it would be likely to produce a stereotyped society in which progress would become difficult and slow.|$|E

40|$|Trade union crisis, {{working class}} crisis or {{wage-earner}} crisis ? Jacques Capdevielle. French trade unionism, {{as that of}} other developed countries, is in dire straits. While the diagnosis is generally agreed upon, the quest for causes and remedies is difflcult. Trade unionism is confronted with a real revolution, caused by a structural mutation of labor which began about 20 years ago. In its daily life, if not in the factory, the working class has been diluted within the <b>wage</b> <b>earning</b> <b>class,</b> and this dilution both integrated and split it : two convergent factors, in any case, which made it lose its specificity. As if this phenomenon was not complex enough, its analysis was hampered for a long time, at least in France, by the reference to a mythical working class. Capdevielle Jacques.

40|$|Based {{on various}} recent studies, the paper {{argues that the}} {{contemporary}} <b>wage</b> <b>earning</b> working <b>class</b> and lower middle class holds increasingly unfavorable views of corporations, as well as towards the federal government, especially among white males. This corresponds to rising authoritarianism, which itself results from declining economic opportunity and loss of status. Consequently, white males are searching for a leader to set things right and herald renewed white working man privilege. However, the simultaneous rejection of the established institutions of power suggests a generalized nihilism rather than any particular political commitment. Should frustration escalate and economic conditions deteriorate further, the paper predicts a generalized and randomized authoritarian destructiveness, rather than a coherent political movement...|$|R

We find that the {{selection of}} individuals into involuntary part-time work is more closely tied to job characteristics than personal or human capital characteristics.

Our econometric results suggest that stigmatization leads to a 39 % reduction in the <b>wage</b> <b>earned</b> by ex-convicts relative to the <b>wage</b> <b>earned</b> by non-convicts. They also suggest that the peer-group effect accounts for {{a reduction in the}} relative earnings of ex-convicts of 1. 1 % per year of study. In addition, we also show that ex-convicts earn 3. 1 % less per year of experience than non-convicts. Stigma Effect, Peer Effect, Crime Rate, Returns to Schooling, Wage Discrimination...|$|R
