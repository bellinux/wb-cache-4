2500|$|Following the {{submission}} {{and acceptance}} of this plea, the judge insisted that Berdella confess under oath as to Pearson's death. In response to questioning by his attorneys, Berdella stated: [...] "I put a plastic bag over his head, and tied it with rope and allowed him to suffocate." [...] When asked if he performed this act deliberately, and <b>with</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought,</b> Berdella simply stated, [...] "Yes." [...] He {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Upon being sentenced, Berdella was transferred to the Missouri State Penitentiary, to commence his life sentence. He would later be temporarily placed in protective custody at the Potosi Correctional Center, due to concerns for his safety.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{decision}} in In re Winship in 1970, the Court expressly said {{for the first time}} that due process demands from the government proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of a crime. [...] Thus, the Court held that a state court not force a defendant to prove he did not act <b>with</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> in order to avoid a murder conviction, as in Mullaney v. Wilbur, [...] [...] Criminal law [...] "is concerned not only with guilt or innocence in the abstract, but also with the degree of criminal culpability assessed" [...] in the defendant. [...] Thus, redefining the elements of murder to make the level of intent required bear on punishment was not an appropriate method for avoiding the reasonable-doubt requirement of the Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 1981, both counsels {{delivered}} their {{closing arguments}} {{before the jury}} (these closing arguments, rebuttals and surrebuttals lasted until December 22). In his closing argument {{on behalf of the}} prosecution, Stirling Norris described Bonin as an insatiable, callous individual who acted <b>with</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought,</b> and who derived extreme pleasure from the suffering he inflicted upon his victims. Having outlined the torture Bonin's victims had endured, Norris concluded his closing arguments by urging the jury to [...] "give him [...] what he has earned". Defense attorney William Charvet began his closing argument in defense of Bonin on December 21. Although Charvet did not specifically ask the jurors to find Bonin not guilty, he did request they only return the [...] "reasonable verdict you can bring"; indicating a likelihood of not guilty verdicts on at least some counts upon which Bonin stood charged. Charvet then hearkened towards the credibility of some of the delivered testimony, pouring particular scorn upon Miley and Munro, whom he emphasized had turned state's evidence, and thus, Charvet alleged, had tailored their testimony to the desires of the police. As such, Charvet contended the testimony of both accomplices as unworthy of belief. Charvet repeatedly reminded the jury he had exposed a myriad of inconsistencies in the testimony of Munro's account of the murder of Steven Wells in the various statements he had given, and had compelled him to admit that he lied on numerous occasions.|$|E

60|$|He {{began to}} dig furiously with the shoe, {{throwing}} the snow <b>with</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> full in Pat's face.

In a few minutes Walter had dug away enough snow to get his shoes under him and walked forth in triumph, followed by Hal. Sparrer, anxious to prove himself a good sport, refused all aid. Being small and light he had not sunk in as the others had and managed to get one shoe under him. With this for a support he soon had the other fastened. It was the work of a moment to adjust the first one and he was ready to take his place in line.|$|E

This is certainly a magnificent edifice, and yet I doubt whether it is so impressive as it might and ought to have been made, considering its immensity. It makes no more impression than you can well account to yourself for, and you rather wonder that it does not make more.

5000|$|<b>Malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> is {{no longer}} {{regarded}} as a necessary mens rea element to prove a murder conviction. The term is a catch-all phrase that encompasses all the states of mind that are sufficient mens rea [...] for murder. Most Australian jurisdictions require some degree of actual awareness of the resulting consequences of the accused's own actions to justify a murder conviction. The High Court of Australia affirmed {{that there is a}} spectrum of mens rea ranging from intention to kill to reckless indifference that would be relevant in securing a murder conviction. However, the High Court ruled that it was not necessary to prove <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> in a manslaughter conviction. The Full Court in Victoria distinguished between the two classes of manslaughter. They were manslaughter by reckless indifference and manslaughter by criminal negligence in R v Nydam in which <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> was definitively ruled out as an element in a charge of manslaughter by criminal negligence.|$|R
6000|$|Afterwards I {{looked at}} many of the {{pictures}} of the old masters, and found myself gradually getting a taste for them; at least, they give me more and more pleasure the oftener I come to see them. Doubtless, I shall be able to pass for a man of taste by the time I return to America. It is an acquired taste, like that for wines; and I question whether a man is really any truer, wiser, or better for possessing it. From the old masters, I went among the English painters, and found myself more favorably inclined towards some of them than at my previous visits; seeing something wonderful even in Turner's lights and mists and yeasty waves, although I should like him still better if his pictures looked in the least like what they typify. The most disagreeable of English painters is Etty, who had a diseased appetite for woman's flesh, and spent his whole life, apparently, in painting them with enormously developed busts. I do not mind nudity in a modest and natural way; but Etty's women really thrust their nudity upon you <b>with</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought,</b> [...] . and the worst of it is they are not beautiful.|$|E

60|$|The {{business}} {{portion of}} the town clusters about {{the banks of the}} Leam, and is naturally densest around the well to which the modern settlement owes its existence. Here are the commercial inns, the post-office, the furniture-dealers, the iron-mongers, and all the heavy and homely establishments that connect themselves even with the airiest modes of human life; while upward from the river, by a long and gentle ascent, rises the principal street, which is very bright and cheerful in its physiognomy, and adorned with shop-fronts almost as splendid as those of London, though on a diminutive scale. There are likewise side-streets and cross-streets, many of which are bordered with the beautiful Warwickshire elm, a most unusual kind of adornment for an English town; and spacious avenues, wide enough to afford room for stately groves, with foot-paths running beneath the lofty shade, and rooks cawing and chattering so high in the tree-tops that their voices get musical before reaching the earth. The houses are mostly built in blocks and ranges, in which every separate tenement is a repetition of its fellow, though the architecture of the different ranges is sufficiently various. Some of them are almost palatial in size and sumptuousness of arrangement. Then, {{on the outskirts of the}} town, there are detached villas, enclosed within that separate domain of high stone fence and embowered shrubbery which an Englishman so loves to build and plant around his abode, presenting to the public only an iron gate, with a gravelled carriage-drive winding away towards the half-hidden mansion. Whether in street or suburb, Leamington may fairly be called beautiful, and, at some points, magnificent; but by and by you become doubtfully suspicious of a somewhat unreal finery: it is pretentious, though not glaringly so; it has been built <b>with</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought,</b> as a place of gentility and enjoyment. Moreover, splendid as the houses look, and comfortable as they often are, there is a nameless something about them, betokening that they have not grown out of human hearts, but are the creations of a skilfully applied human intellect: no man has reared any one of them, whether stately or humble, to be his lifelong residence, wherein to bring up his children, who are to inherit it as a home. They are nicely contrived lodging-houses, one and all,--the best as well as the shabbiest of them, --and therefore inevitably lack some nameless property that a home should have. This was the case with our own little snuggery in Lansdowne Circus, as with all the rest; it had not grown out of anybody's individual need, but was built to let or sell, and was therefore like a ready-made garment,--a tolerable fit, but only tolerable.|$|E
