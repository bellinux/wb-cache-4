5|$|Into the 1990s, Bathurst gained wider {{recognition}} from television audiences, first as writer Mark Taylor in Joking Apart from 1993 to 1995, then as David Marsden in Cold Feet from 1998 to 2003. The decade also saw him {{appear in the}} television series The House of Eliott, The Detectives, and Hornblower, and the films Twenty-One (1991) and Terry Jones's The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows (1996).|$|E

25|$|Chinook winds , {{or simply}} Chinooks, are föhn <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{interior}} West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges, although the original usage is {{in reference to}} wet, warm coastal <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest.|$|R
50|$|Baldy Mesa has a {{high desert}} climate with hot dry summers and {{generally}} cold and wet winters. The area experiences intense rain and occasional snow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter months.

5|$|On television, the American Broadcasting Company aired it for {{the first}} time right after its 1979 re-release. The first U.S. {{broadcast}} attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second highest televised movie share at the time behind Gone with the <b>Wind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second biggest TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} inspirations were The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows by Kenneth Grahame, and {{the works}} of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. His literary influences have been P.G. Wodehouse, Tom Sharpe, Jerome K. Jerome, Roy Lewis, Alan Coren, G. K. Chesterton, and Mark Twain.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of the <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child, in a theater {{production}} of The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother, and made her television debut in VH1's In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she won a Young Hollywood Award for her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received positive media attention {{for her role in}} Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone's first starring role and earned her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. This breakthrough was followed with further success in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love and the drama The Help (both 2011).|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} through late 2002, with targeted release dates of December in Japan and early 2003 in North America. During the final stages, two planned dungeons that fell behind schedule were cut {{and replaced with}} a quest to recover Triforce pieces around the Great Sea. Elements of these dungeons were recycled for later Zelda games. On October 15, 2002, Nintendo revealed the game's official Japanese subtitle, Kaze no Takuto (Wind Baton), to emphasize the role of <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. The company announced the official English version, The Wind Waker, on December 2, 2002. In {{the gap between the}} Japanese and North American releases, the designers reworked some troublesome segments, notably shortening the lengthy Triforce quest.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{was drawn}} to acting {{from the age of}} four; she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years. Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage {{production}} of The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows, playing the part of Otter. The actress was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix's Valley Youth Theatre—including The Princess and the Pea, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat—and performed with the theater's improvisational comedy troupe. Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon's All That. Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All Blacks had the {{advantage}} of the <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a move from a scrum to pass to Smith, who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back to Smith who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan attacked but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries to McDonald and Wallace to win 9–0.|$|E
5|$|The Eta Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most massive that can be studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally clears.|$|E
5|$|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{and the only}} one made under {{founding}} member Syd Barrett's leadership. The album, named after the title of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows and featuring a kaleidoscopic cover photo of the band taken by Vic Singh, was recorded from February to May 1967 and released on 5 August 1967. It was produced by Beatles engineer Norman Smith and released in 1967 by EMI Columbia in the United Kingdom and Tower in the United States, in August and October respectively.|$|E

5|$|The region's climate {{has been}} dry since the Tertiary. The area around Licancabur is {{dominated}} by year-round high pressure caused by the South Pacific High, giving it a very sunny climate. Because {{of the lack of}} moisture, solar radiation energy is dissipated primarily by <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Llano de Chajnantor area, wind generally reaches its maximum strength during the day. Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where the ozone layer is thinner) and high altitude, it receives a large amount of ultraviolet radiation. The world's highest level of ultraviolet radiation was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} April 1947, Hordern {{accepted}} the small part of Captain Hoyle in Richard Llewellyn's comic drama film Noose. Two other roles occurred that year: as Maxim de Winter in a television adaption of Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca, followed by {{the part of a}} detective in Good-Time Girl, alongside Dennis Price and Jean Kent. The following year he took part in three plays: Peter Ustinov's The Indifferent Shepherd, which appeared at the newly opened Q Theatre in Brentford, West London; Ibsen's Ghosts; and an adaptation of The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in which he portrayed the part of the blustery, eccentric Mr Toad.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early twentieth century the main channel {{moved away from the}} cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With the <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor {{was raised}} in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her {{childhood}} she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed {{a major part of}} her early years—"the happiest part". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.|$|E
