5|$|Roger's son Robert {{inherited}} {{and improved}} the castle. Robert was a favourite of King John, and hosted him at Warkworth Castle in 1213. The castle {{remained in the}} family line, with periods of guardianship when heirs <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> control their estates. King EdwardI stayed overnight in 1292 and John de Clavering, descendant of Roger fitz Richard, made the Crown his inheritor. With {{the outbreak of the}} Anglo-Scottish Wars, EdwardII invested in castles including Warkworth where he funded the strengthening of the garrison in 1319. Twice in 1327 the Scots besieged the castle without success.|$|E
5|$|John de Vieuxpont died in 1241, {{before he}} came of age. The new heir, John's son Robert, was not old enough to inherit, so the family's lands {{remained}} in wardship. During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont {{came of age in}} around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He was one of the northern lords that revolted in support of Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King HenryIII. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. The guardians of the two girls, who at the time <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the shrievalty of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.|$|E

Pope Urban responded by banning grain shipments from Farnese controlled areas. When the Farnese were then unable to pay their debts the Pope sent debt collectors. Finally the Pope send troops to occupy Castro. The Pope's forces (12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry) were led by Antonio, his brother Taddeo and mercenary field commander Luigi Mattei.|$|E
25|$|In early 1933, Slye, Nolan, and Spencer {{formed the}} Pioneers Trio, with Slye on guitar, Nolan on string bass, and Spencer as lead vocalist. The three rehearsed for weeks {{refining}} their vocal harmonies. During this time, Slye {{continued to work}} with his radio singing group, while Spencer and Nolan began writing songs for the trio. In early 1934, the fiddle player Hugh Farr joined the group, adding a bass voice to their vocal arrangements. Later that year, the Pioneers Trio became the Sons of the Pioneers when a radio station announcer changed their name because he felt they <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> be pioneers. The name was received well and fit the group, which {{was no longer a}} trio.|$|E
25|$|The MDC's first {{opportunity}} to test opposition to the Mugabe government came in February 2000, when a referendum was held on a draft constitution proposed by the government. Among its elements, the new constitution would have permitted President Mugabe to seek two additional terms in office, granted government officials immunity from prosecution, and authorised government seizure of white-owned land. The referendum was handily defeated. Shortly thereafter, the government, through a loosely organised group of war veterans,some of the so-called war veterans judging from their age were not war veterans as they <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> have fought in the chimurenga, sanctioned an aggressive land redistribution program often characterised by forced expulsion of white farmers and violence against both farmers and farm employees.|$|E

25|$|In Livy's account, Tarquinius Priscus {{had been}} elected king {{on the death of}} the {{previous}} king, Ancus Marcius, whose two sons <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> inherit or offer themselves for election. When Servius' popularity and his marriage to Tarquinius' daughter made him a likely successor to the throne, these sons attempted to seize the throne for themselves. They hired two assassins, who attacked and severely wounded Tarquinius. Tanaquil immediately ordered the palace to be shut, and publicly announced from a palace window that Tarquinius had appointed Servius as regent; meanwhile, Tarquinius died of his wounds. When his death became public knowledge, the senate elected Servius as king, and the sons of Ancus fled to exile in Suessa Pometia. Livy describes this as the first occasion that the people of Rome were not involved in the election of the king. In Plutarch, Servius reluctantly consented to the kingship at the death-bed insistence of Tanaquil.|$|E
25|$|When Lud died, Androgeus and {{his brother}} Tenvantius <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> rule, so the throne went to their uncle Cassibelanus. Androgeus was made Duke of Trinovantum (London) and Kent, and participated in the defence of Britain against Julius Caesar. After Caesar's first two invasions were repelled, the Britons held a celebration at which sacrifices {{were made to the}} gods and games played. Cuelinus, a nephew of Androgeus, {{wrestled}} with Hirelglas, Cassibelanus's nephew, and killed him in a dispute over the result. Cassibelanus demanded Androgeus hand over his nephew for trial, but fearing the king's intentions, Androgeus refused, offering to try him in his own court. Cassibelanus made war on Androgeus, who appealed to Caesar for help. He gave hostages, including his own son Scaeva, as proof of his intentions, and Caesar invaded a third time. Between them, Androgeus and Caesar forced Cassibelanus to submit and agree to pay tribute to Rome. Caesar spent the winter in Britain, and he and Cassibelanus became friends. When he finally returned to Rome to fight the civil war against Pompey, Androgeus went with him, never to return.|$|E
25|$|Yazid was {{succeeded by}} his son, Mu'awiya II, but {{he died a}} few weeks later and never enjoyed any real {{authority}} outside the family's traditional stronghold of Syria. His death provoked a crisis, since his other brothers <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> succeed. As a result, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate and Ibn al-Zubayr was accepted by most of the Muslims as their new leader: the Umayyad governor of Iraq, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, was evicted from the province, coins in Ibn al-Zubayr's name were minted in Persia, and the Qaysi tribes of northern Syria and the Jazira went over to his cause. Even some members of the Umayyad family considered going to Mecca and declaring their allegiance to him. In central and southern Syria, however, the Umayyad cause was upheld by the local tribes, led by the Banu Kalb under Ibn Bahdal and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. At their initiative, a shura of the loyal tribes was held at Jabiyah, where Marwan ibn al-Hakam, a cousin of Mu'awiya I who had served under the Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644–656) but played no role in Mu'awiya's Umayyad regime, was elected as the Umayyads' caliphal candidate.|$|E

25|$|Other {{challenges}} met {{those children}} who <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> work in factories or were evacuated to areas {{where there were no}} factories that could accept student laborers. The demands by the military and a strict rationing system meant that even in the countryside food was scarce. Transitioning from inner cities to quiet, bucolic towns meant that the children were struck with a sense of alienation as they faced an unfamiliar environment, the growing resentment of their host families, and ridicule from local children {{when it came to the}} difference in accents or ignorance concerning agricultural tasks. One teacher who was evacuated with his students in 1945 kept a diary and noted the gradual shift in daily activities from education to agriculture to gathering activities. By the summer, students were even preparing for the eventual Allied invasion of Japan by training to fight with bamboo spears and throwing rocks at targets. The students spent part of each day cultivating gardens and some days they were sent out to forage for things such as wisteria bark and bamboo shoots or bark; on other days they made charcoal and carried it from a distant mountain; classroom assignments included writing letters to soldiers at the front.|$|E

500|$|Æthelwulf died on 13 January 858. According to the Annals of St Neots, he {{was buried}} at Steyning in Sussex, but his body was later {{transferred}} to Winchester, probably by Alfred. Æthelwulf was succeeded by Æthelbald in Wessex and Æthelberht in Kent and the south-east. The prestige conferred by a Frankish marriage {{was so great that}} Æthelbald then wedded his step-mother Judith, to Asser's retrospective horror; he described the marriage as a [...] "great disgrace", and [...] "against God's prohibition and Christian dignity". When Æthelbald died only two years later, Æthelberht became King of Wessex as well as Kent, and Æthelwulf's intention of dividing his kingdoms between his sons was thus set aside. In the view of Yorke and Abels this was because Æthelred and Alfred <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> rule, and Æthelberht agreed in return that his younger brothers would inherit the whole kingdom on his death, whereas Kirby and Nelson think that Æthelberht just became the trustee for his younger brothers' share of the bookland.|$|E
