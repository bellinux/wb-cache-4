6000|$|... "I am--so {{happy that}} I'm afraid it never will happen. If I do go, I'll write {{and tell you}} all about the fine sights, and how I get on. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> to?" [...] asked Ralph, {{beginning}} enthusiastically and ending rather bashfully, for he admired Merry very much, and was not quite sure how this proposal would be received.|$|R
6000|$|... "You really aren't {{responsible}} in the least," [...] Jessie declared. [...] "Still, I {{can understand the}} idea troubling you. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are many}} {{difficulties}} which you cannot understand, which prevent me. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{shut the door}} which God has opened to so many dark lands?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thought I might cheer you up," [...] said Luke, appearing. [...] "How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play 'The Girl I Left Behind Me,' or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL, petting her, 'There, there, you foolish woman. Joy {{will come}} in the morning; I never was surer of anything. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take you home now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No matter. I am {{to blame}} for it when it did happen; and now you will never hear another word from me. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> swear it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... “That depends. I really don’t want {{to cause}} you trouble. You see, I {{was fond of}} you once, Tony—and <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell you that I am still?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, but, dear, {{you must}} {{remember}} your mother. She gets so anxious, and every word the doctor says is law. How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come again like this, perhaps?--like Santa Claus?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, my boy, {{nothing like}} looking at matters cheerfully. You know, lad, how warmly all your old friends are with you. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> bring Charlie next time I come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He gave {{me another}} smile, sadder, fainter, sweeter than before, and said: [...] "When <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to see <b>me</b> again, so I could work out this dollar?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Happy thought!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{came out}} here to write letters, not caring for fishing, {{especially}} in boats; how <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write {{the rest of the}} story from your dictation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I was indiscreet," [...] she confessed. [...] "I {{dare say}} {{you know as}} much about him as I do. At what time <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come and help you change the bandages?" ...|$|E
