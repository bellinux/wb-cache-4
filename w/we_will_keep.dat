25|$|It is our policy-and we have {{increasingly}} {{the means and}} the detailed plans {{to carry out this}} policy-to ensure that the Soviet leadership knows that if they chose some intermediate level of aggression, we could, by selective, large (but still less than maximum) nuclear attacks, exact an unacceptably high price in the things the Soviet leaders appear to value most--political and military control, military force both nuclear and conventional, and the industrial capability to sustain a war. In our planning we have not ignored the problem of ending the war, nor would we ignore it {{in the event of a}} war. And, of course, we have, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep,</b> a survivable and enduring capability to attack the full range of targets, including the Soviet economic base, if that is the appropriate response to a Soviet strike.|$|E

He cabled Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it, and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz {{had been sent to}} Turkey on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler, as did SS officer Kurt Becher: [...] "Himmler said to me: 'Take whatever you can from the Jews. Promise them whatever you want. What <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> is another matter.'" ...|$|E
500|$|To {{the right}} of Queen Charlotte, HMS Brunswick had {{initially}} struggled to join the action. Labouring behind the flagship, her captain John Harvey received a rebuke from Howe for the delay. Spurred by this signal, Harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped Queen Charlotte, blocking her view of {{the eastern half of}} the French fleet for a time and taking severe damage from French fire as she did so. Harvey hoped to run aboard Jacobin and support his admiral directly, but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between Achille and Vengeur du Peuple. This manoeuvre failed when Brunswick's anchors became entangled in Vengeur's rigging. Harvey's master asked if Vengeur should be cut loose, to which Harvey replied [...] "No; we have got her and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> her". The two ships swung so close to each other that Brunswick's crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids, the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet.|$|E

500|$|In early 2011, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero gained {{international}} attention when Sir Richard Branson {{announced plans to}} introduce lemurs—endangered primates from Madagascar—to Moskito Island {{as part of a}} captive breeding project for conservation purposes. Biologists, conservationists, and the general public quickly voiced concerns over the impact that would have on the native species of the island. In particular, people feared that the lemurs would wipe out the local population of Virgin Islands dwarf sphaeros, which was referred to as “one of the world’s rarest lizards”, because of the lemurs’ “aggressive, omnivorous” behaviour. Other researchers instead focused on concerns about the lemurs’ ability to thrive or the pathogens they might introduce. The leader of Branson's environmental impact assessment agreed that caution was needed with the introduction, even before the plans to introduce the lemurs were announced. Regarding the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero, Branson stated that the concerns were misplaced because lemurs mostly eat plant material and would rarely eat geckos if at all. However, Branson ultimately backed down, stating, “I will keep the lemurs enclosed whilst we get experts to conduct further surveys on geckos and particularly the dwarf geckos. If these studies indicate any real risk to these geckos, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> the lemurs enclosed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Raja Petra {{was held}} without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Centre in {{northern}} Perak state, which had 60 ISA detainees, mostly suspected Islamic extremists. The ISA permits an initial detention of two months for investigation, {{followed by a}} two-year jail sentence which can be renewed indefinitely. The 1948 ISA is a holdover from British colonial rule, intended for use against communist insurgents. Raja Petra's wife Marina Lee Abdullah said: [...] "(Police) said my husband has been sent to Kamunting this morning {{and that he will}} remain there for two years with no trial. This is the worst news I can receive but <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> fighting for his release. This is dirty foul play by the government as they know {{that we are in the}} process of fighting for his release in the court but I was expecting this. Raja Petra was detained for allegedly 'insulting Islam' and publishing articles on his website which has tarnished the country's leadership to the point of causing confusion among the people." [...] Raja Petra's lawyer sought his release in a court hearing but this was dismissed. Raja Petra's detention caused widespread protests by civil society groups, lawyers and other online commentators.|$|E
