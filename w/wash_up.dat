5|$|In 2015 {{a common}} grey seal {{found its way}} from the <b>Wash</b> <b>up</b> the river and spent a few weeks {{sleeping}} in gardens next to the river in Deeping St James. The seal was spotted further downstream in Spalding as it eventually made its {{way back to the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} oviparous {{like most other}} fish, laying their eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the {{consistency}} of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Once empty, the egg case {{is known as a}} mermaid's purse, and can <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> on shore. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, Alice {{travels to}} Alaska in an airplane, {{tracking}} broadcasts {{from a safe}} haven called Arcadia; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of Los Angeles, where they find survivors living in a prison which is surrounded by thousands of undead. They meet Luther West, (Boris Kodjoe) who leads the surviving band from the prison, Wendell (Fulvio Cecere), Crystal Waters (Kacey Clarke), Bennett (Kim Coates), Kim Yong (Norman Yeung), and Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). With their help, Alice finally lands on the prison's roof and learns Arcadia isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no-one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, Chris (Wentworth Miller), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to <b>wash</b> <b>up,</b> but catches Wendell attempting to peep. Holding him at gunpoint, they are attacked {{by a group of}} infected that dug into the prison. They take Wendell, but she manages to kill them.|$|E

25|$|A Coast Guard Strike Team, {{specially}} trained to manage oil spills, was {{flown in from}} California. A containment boom was placed around the ship, {{and some of the}} oil was vacuumed off the beach.

25|$|The US {{military}} used {{ocean dumping}} for unused weapons and bombs, including ordinary bombs, UXO, landmines {{and chemical weapons}} from at least 1919 until 1970. Millions of pounds of ordnance were disposed of in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of at least 16 states, from New Jersey to Hawaii (although these, of course, do not <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> onshore, and the US {{is not the only}} country who has practiced this).|$|E

25|$|Yeast {{is added}} to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of {{thousands}} of litres) called a washback. Washbacks are commonly made of Oregon Pine or stainless steel. The yeast feeds on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation and can take up to three days to complete. When complete, the liquid has an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume, and is now known as <b>wash.</b> <b>Up</b> until this point the process has been quite similar to the production of beer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1891, House left the Maxim Syndicate and started a factory, at Teddington on the River Thames, to build fast motor {{launches}} using kerosene oil as fuel. During the trials of the first launch, the Doil, its speed caused a wake to <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> on banks of the river. For this Henry House was summoned {{to appear in court}} and fined 10 pounds and costs. One of the witnesses for the Crown swore the craft was going 26 knots an hour, testimony which proved to be a good advertisement.|$|E

25|$|Orangutans {{living in}} Borneo {{scavenge}} fish that <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> {{along the shore}} and scoop catfish out of small ponds for fresh meals. Over two years, anthropologist Anne Russon saw several animals on these forested islands learn {{on their own to}} jab at catfish with sticks, so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan's waiting hands. Although orangutans usually fished alone, Russon observed pairs of apes catching catfish on a few occasions. On the island of Kaja in Borneo, a male orangutan was observed using a pole apparently trying to spear or bludgeon fish. This individual had seen humans fishing with spears. Although not successful, he was later able to improvise by using the pole to catch fish already trapped in the locals' fishing lines.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to survival, the early colonists {{were expected to}} make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realized there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{the hunters}} separate, {{with the younger}} one manning a spot high on a cliff near a {{waterfall}}. He descends from his post to <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> in a small waterfall in the hills. His gun out of reach, the hunter suddenly finds himself cornered by the grizzly, who rears and roars {{at the sight of}} the man. Faced with certain death, the hunter cowers in fear. The grizzly, seemingly affected by the hunter's distress, turns and leaves. The young hunter, impressed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his gun into the air. When the hunter's companion joins him, having heard the gunshots, the younger man tells him that the bear is dead. However, spying the bear ascending a scree, the older man raises his rifle to shoot, only to be stopped by the other man. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they free the young cub and then ride off into the wilderness.|$|E

25|$|In the Chinese Market Mary meets Klarion the Witch boy, {{who tries}} {{to get some of}} her power. After Eclipso {{attempts}} to corrupt Mary, the Shadowpact take notice of Mary's activities, and attack Mary and Eclipso, who are overwhelmed and escape. Eclipso takes Mary to meet Darkseid, who offers to show her true darkness. Upon observing his treatment of people as mere puppets, Mary attacks him. An interruption by Desaad allows Mary to escape. Eclipso talks Mary into returning to Darkseid and submitting to his authority, suggesting that she can usurp his powers if she grows strong enough. The asteroid on which Mary and Eclipso are standing is destroyed by a stray shot from the Dominators and Monarch's armies. After Eclipso teleports her to safety, Mary blasts Eclipso with her own black diamond after realizing that Eclipso was only interested in selling her to Darkseid as a concubine in exchange for power. Eclipso manages to wrest the diamond from Mary's grasp, and leaves, telling her that she is once again alone. Eclipso then attempts to kill Mary, but finds that she is too strong. During their battle, Mary calls down the lightning, which strikes the two of them, causing Mary to fall into the ocean and <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> on the shores of Themiscyra.|$|E
500|$|The {{wreck of}} New Carissa caused {{one of the}} most serious oil spills to affect the state of Oregon, and the worst since a 1984 spill near Longview, Washington that dumped [...] of oil into the Columbia River. As Oregon has no {{significant}} oil refinery facilities, oil tankers do not often dock at its ports, making the state relatively safe from oil spills. Analysis conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that over 3,000 shorebirds and seabirds perished. The birds belonged to more than 50 species. Among the birds killed were 262 threatened marbled murrelets and between four and eight endangered western snowy plovers. Harbor seals, fish, and shellfish were also killed or affected. Several beaches were fouled, with tarballs continuing to <b>wash</b> <b>up</b> for more than a month after the wreck.|$|E
