5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in {{painting}} trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials {{were influenced by}} their political ideals of bringing order {{to the world and}} tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E

25|$|The {{study found}} that when mental {{rotation}} {{is used as a}} predictor of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between mental rotation and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern. Male correlations ranged from -0.03 to 0.54. However, an interesting finding was that in the three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. Interestingly enough, for the verbal aptitude test on SAT, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.|$|E

In Table 2, the p value of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test exceeds the significance level 0.05 for all of the experiments, signifying that these results are likely to follow the normal distribution. Thus, we conducted the statistical test under the assumption of normality. Then, we checked whether there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between the mean of the results using the paired t test. In Table 2, the p values of the paired t test for all subjects are below the significance level 0.05, signifying that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between the result of the two experiments. Therefore, we consider that the proposed system effectively decreases the waiting time.|$|R
