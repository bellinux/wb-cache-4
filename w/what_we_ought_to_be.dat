It was a notable fight; such as had not taken place within the memory of the oldest boy in the village, and from which, in after years, events of juvenile history were dated,--especially pugilistic events, of which, when a good one came off it used to be said that, [...] "such a battle had not taken place since the year of the Great Fight." [...] Bob Croaker was a noted fighter, Martin Rattler was, up to this date, an untried hero. Although fond of rough play and boisterous mischief, he had an unconquerable aversion to earnest fighting, and very rarely indeed returned home with a black eye,--much to the satisfaction of Aunt Dorothy Grumbit, who objected to all fighting from principle, and frequently asserted, in gentle tones, {{that there should be no}} soldiers or sailors (fighting sailors, she meant) at all, but that people ought all to settle everything the best way they could without fighting, and live peaceably with one another, as the Bible told them to do. They would be far happier and better off, she was sure of that; and if everybody was of her way of thinking, there would be neither swords, nor guns, nor pistols, nor squibs, nor anything else at all!

60|$|Oh, my friends, {{take this}} to heart solemnly, in the year to come. Our troubles, more of them at least than we fancy, are our own fault, and not our neighbours', or the government's, or anyone's else. And those which are not our own fault {{directly}} are so in this way, that they are sent as sharp and wholesome lessons to us; and if we were <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> we should not want those lessons. Do not fancy {{that that is a}} sad and doleful thought to begin the new year with. God forbid! It would be doleful and sad indeed if any one of us, in spite of all his right-doing, might be plunged into any hopeless misery, through the fault of other people, over whom he has no control. But thanks be to the Lord, it is not so. We are His children, and He cares for {{each and every one of}} us separately. Each and every one of us has to answer for himself alone, face to face with his God, day by day; every man must bear his own burden; and to every one of us who love God, all things will work together for good. It is, and was, and always will be, as Abraham well knew, far from God to punish the righteous with the wicked. The Judge of all the earth will do right. None of us who repents and turns from the sins he sees round him and in him; none of us who prays for the light and guiding of God's Spirit; none of us who struggles day by day to keep himself unspotted from this evil world, and live as God's son, without scandal or ill-name in the midst of a sinful and perverse generation; none of us who does that, but God's blessing will rest on him. What ruins others will only teach and strengthen him; what brings others to shame, will only bring him to honour, and make his righteousness plain to be seen by all, that God may be glorified in His people. Let the coming year be what it may; to the holy, the humble, the upright, the godly, it will be a blessed year, fulfilling the blessed promises of the Lord, that those who trust in Him shall never be confounded.|$|E

40|$|Digital storytelling, the {{practice}} of combining personal narrative with multimedia to produce a short autobiographical movie, continues to expand its creative uses in classrooms around the world. However, teaching the actual story process within digital storytelling presents several challenges for teachers as it demands a combination of creative writing, basic film conventions, visual and media literacy, {{as well as the}} technical facility with the technology. Digital storytelling presents a unique opportunity for students to acquire much more than new technology skills. It enables them to represent their voices in a manner rarely addressed by state and district curriculum while practicing the digital literacy skills that will be important to their 21 st century futures. Storytelling and multimedia production have rarely been taught, if at all, while the development of students narrative skills has rested on the shoulders of English teachers. This pedagogical disconnect between story literacy and technology literacy {{is at the heart of}} the multiliteracies debate. Elliot W. Eisner writes in The Kind of Schools We Need, <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developing in our schools is not simply a narrow array of literacy skills limited to a restrictive range of meaning systems, but a spectrum of literacies [...] .

40|$|The incentives-for-authors {{formulation}} of copyright’s purpose is so deeply ingrained in our discourse and our thought processes {{that it is}} astonishingly hard to avoid invoking, even when one is consciously trying not to do so. Yet avoiding that formulation is exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing. Everything we know about creativity and creative processes suggests that copyright plays very little role in motivating creative work. In the contemporary information society, the purpose of copyright is to enable the provision of capital and organization so that creative work may be exploited. And the choice of copyright as a principal means of promoting cultural production has consequences for the content of culture as well. This reframing has four important consequences for debates about copyright law and policy. First, abandoning the incentives-for-authors story requires {{us to talk about}} cultural progress differently. The incentives-for-authors story has functioned as a smokescreen, enabling scholars, judges, and legislators to conflate economic and creative motivation. Severing the motivational link between creativity and economics requires us {{to come up with a}} better understanding of how cultural progress emerges, and a more accurate account of how the economic incentives that copyright provides affect progress more generally. Second, an account of copyright as incentives-for-capital suggests a different approach to conceptualizing the kind of “property” that copyright represents. Copyright scholars habitually compare copyright to property in land, a conceptual move that passes over an important stage in the evolution of economic activity and associated economic rights. There are important benefits to be gained from comparing post-industrial, information property to industrial, corporate property, and copyright law more explicitly to corporate law. Specifically, copyright law in the post-industrial era works to separate authorship from control of creative works so that a set of coordination and governance problems closely associated with information resources can be solved. Third, comparing copyright more explicitly to industrial, corporate property and legal regimes governing its use suggests some different ways of thinking and talking about problems of social welfare that so often bedevil regimes of property law. Fourth, comparing copyright more explicitly to industrial, corporate property foregrounds copyright law’s (largely unrealized) potential to function as a tool for ensuring accountability to the authors without whom the copyright system could not function...|$|E
40|$|In 1992 {{following}} the acquittals of four LAPD officers that brutally beat motorist Rodney King, riots broke out {{for about a}} week withgreat destruction. The rioters caused an estimated 1 billion in damage; most stores were burned to the ground. The riots left 2, 383 wounded and 53 dead. [1] In this atmosphere, the rapper Ice Cube released the song 2 ̆ 2 We Had to Tear this Muthafucka Up, 2 ̆ 2 during which he juxtaposed the clash between white authorities and frustrations of local, minorities in urban areas. Amidst the background of political speech by Mayor Ben West and newscaster reports of 2 ̆ 2 The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty [...] . 2 ̆ 2 Ice Cube begins his rap: Not guilty, the filthy, devils tried to kill me. When the news gets to the hood the niggas will be, Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust. Kickin 2 ̆ 7 up dust is a must. I can 2 ̆ 7 t trust, a cracker in a blue uniform, Stick a nigga like a unicorn. Born wicked, Laurence, Powell, foul Cut his fuckin 2 ̆ 7 throat and I smile. [2] Ice Cube 2 ̆ 7 s song not only narrates the story that the men were acquitted—which led to the rioting in Los Angeles, but it also exhibited the conflict between gangsta rap culture and the LAPD culture. Gangsta rap is known as much or more for its vulgarity as for its politics in mainstream American media, and the LAPD is renowned for its brutality though it maintains that it only seeks to actively maintain law and order. This project will use the Rodney King riots as a lens to examine the racial and cultural conflict between these two groups. My preliminary thesis is that LA gangsta rap and the culture that it represents only mirrored what the minorities of Los Angeles faced under the oppressive authority of the LAPD; and that the LA riots served as a concrete manifestation of the ethos of gangsta rap with its call to lash out against the abuses of white authority and strive for local control. While my thesis has not been wholly cemented it will certainly contain elements of: 1) {{the manner in which the}} violent rap culture coopted the violent style of LAPD and vice versa, 2) the struggle for local authority between a white minority and a black majority in the urban neighborhoods, and 3) the riots as a populist expression of the sentiments of gangsta rap group Niggaz With Attitude and rapper Ice Cube as an extension of the Black Power movement. The questions that will guide my research are: In what ways does the gangsta rap culture reflect the opposing LAPD culture in terms of racism, violence, and vulgarity? To what extent did the gangsta rap and LAPD subcultures represent the urban and suburban cultures, respectively, in Los Angeles? If representative, how did that impact rioting? Did gangsta rap music have a sustaining effect on the riots? In what ways were both gangsta rap culture and the LAPD altered by the riots? Was one affected more than the other? Considering NWA claimed to be a source of news for urban struggle, was it a truthful representation of daily life for African-Americans in urban LA? Was it accurate or excessive? What was the influence of control of authority and distribution of power between local minorities and majorities on the relationship between the two subcultures and the rioting? There are many scholarly studies on LA in the 1980 s and early 1990 s under the Reagan and Bush administrations. [3] While cultural scholars have examined the rise of LA hip hop, political scholars have examined the beating of Rodney King and the riots that followed in the context of the broader struggles of the civil rights movement in the conservative era. These books have differed in their approaches whether they emphasize issues of local authority, popular culture, and cultural politics. Stephen Tuck 2 ̆ 7 s We Ain 2 ̆ 7 t <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> (2010), Jeff Chang 2 ̆ 7 s Can 2 ̆ 7 t Stop, Won 2 ̆ 7 t Stop (2005), Bradford Martin 2 ̆ 7 s The Other Eighties (2011), and Gil Troy 2 ̆ 7 s Morning in America (2005), use different source and frameworks to understand the role of race, local politics, and popular culture in Los Angeles. [4] In my work I want to undertake my thesis from a perspective that bridges national and grassroots politics with developments in popular culture to deepen historical understanding of the impact of gangsta rap as a form of local, popular-cultural politics on the 1992 riot, an event that would take place on the national stage. The Chapter entitled 2 ̆ 2 Reagan, Rap, and Resistance, 1979 - 20002 ̆ 2 in We Ain 2 ̆ 7 t <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> addresses issues of local authority, grassroots movements, and the Civil Rights Movement. Stephen Tuck, a cultural historian, argues that the simultaneous rise of rap music and resurgence of political conservatism at the time of Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s election represented the decline of the traditional Civil Rights Movement. Tuck contends that the fight for racial equality became a more localized, grass-roots effort. [5] While contemporary critics contended that gangsta rappers reinforced negative stereotypes by glorifying violence and wearing heavy jewelry and politicians claimed it as an attack on traditional family values, Tuck believed that the critics of gangsta rap 2 ̆ 2 missed the point. 2 ̆ 2 According to him, rap raised many of the issues on the ground such as unemployment, poor housing, prison, and the police while simultaneously illuminating the tensions between black Americans by marginalizing groups such as women, homosexuals, and middle to upper-class blacks. [6] My work will differ from Tuck 2 ̆ 7 s insofar as I will focus on the Rodney King beating and riot—issues that he does not even mention. I will combine his approach of looking at cultural politics with a popular culture approach by studying the lyrics of the music itself. I also want to further investigate an idea that he just mentions which is that 2 ̆ 2 hip hop was a reflection of existing [inner-city] tensions. 2 ̆ 2 [7] While this is just an aside in Tuck 2 ̆ 7 s writing I want to explore this idea as it pertains to the Rodney King issue, the LAPD, and gangsta rap specifically. While Tuck only briefly examines the history of hip hop, Jeff Chang 2 ̆ 7 s book Can 2 ̆ 7 t Stop, Won 2 ̆ 7 t Stop: a History of the Hip Hop Generation deals specifically with the rise of rap over time. His chapters 2 ̆ 2 The Culture Assassins: Geography, Generation, and Gangsta Rap 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Gonna Work It Out: Peace and Rebellion in Los Angeles 2 ̆ 2 specifically cover gangsta rap 2 ̆ 7 s rise and the LA riots. Chang, a journalist and hip-hop critic, while presenting the history of the rise of NWA argues that while they had political ideas worked into their songs, the group had no intention of becoming role models for the black community. [8] They wanted to simultaneously use shock and excess in order to gain sales and to express the unheard voice of the 2 ̆ 2 brother on the corner. 2 ̆ 2 [9] My thesis diverges from Chang 2 ̆ 7 s work because I want to focus on the way that, though the group had no intention of becoming leaders, in a paradoxical way their songs are a source of cultural politics. This ironically caused them to become the leading voice for expressing urban tensions in a way other artists could not. In a later chapter Chang treats the riots and building of LA, but he does so from a gang perspective. In my own work I will not focus on gang activity whatsoever. I will look at the roots of the rioting and the cultural clash between gangsta rap and the LAPD. Brad Martin 2 ̆ 7 s, The Other Eighties: a Secret History of America in the Age of Reagan is a history of popular culture during the 1980 s and how it can explain oppositional events and movements that occurred during the Reagan era to challenge the conservative ascendency. Pertinent to my work is his chapter 2 ̆ 2 Fighting the Power: The Response of African American Politics and Culture. 2 ̆ 2 In this chapter Martin, a political historian, claims that policies of urban industrialization, cuts to social welfare, and 2 ̆ 2 white flight 2 ̆ 2 to suburbs did not make the urban underclass passive but that it made the black community more active in cultural realms, particularly the arts, to achieve political goals. [10] Martin goes on to claim that gangsta rap is a West Coast extension of the consciously political, militant rap style of Public Enemy and therefore an extension of historic black resistance to white authority. Gangsta rap dealt with themes such as police oppression and criminalization of black youth. I want to build on Martin 2 ̆ 7 s closing notion that through gangsta rap 2 ̆ 2 African Americans used hip-hop and the cultural realm to thrust ideas and messages into the public consciousness. 2 ̆ 2 [11] He, like all of the source material that treats gangsta rap as simply a force of cultural politics from the perspective of African Americans, but this neglects any analysis of the opposing LAPD culture and the ways in which rap music shaped the views of white police officers toward the African American communities they patrolled. My research examines gangsta rap culture and LAPD culture together to more thoroughly understand the perceptions of the 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 by each community. This more comprehensive analysis will illuminate more fully the tensions that begot the riots {{following the}} acquittals in the Rodney King case. Gil Troy 2 ̆ 7 s Morning in America uses a cultural-political approach to examine events that occurred during Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s administration from a national lens. Troy 2 ̆ 7 s justifies his approach by virtue of his focus, Reagan, who himself was a dominating political figure and believed in a top-down approach. Troy analyzes an event in each year of Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s presidency in a different location each time. He uses this strategy to illustrate that the 1980 s were a 2 ̆ 2 time of high drama, great progress, and intense frustration. 2 ̆ 2 His own caveat is that even though this was time when many realized the American Dream there were still many others that 2 ̆ 2 demanded liberty and justice and equality and prosperity and meaning and morality and community for all. 2 ̆ 2 [12] This caveat is where my work adds on to his because of its civil-rights focus. The approach used by Troy is important for me in building my thesis because by combining my grassroots political approach with a national, top-down approach such as his I am able to juxtapose the national and local political rhetoric to strengthen my work and further situate it historically. I will use a variety of primary sources to narrate my thesis and answer my research questions. These sources include songs, memoirs, legislative reporting, and newspaper and magazine articles. The songs I will use are from the most influential gangsta rap group, NWA, and from the solo work of its leading member Ice Cube. The group was based in Los Angeles and started to gain real fame and notoriety with the release of their album Straight Outta Compton (1988) just a few years prior to the beating of Rodney King. The songs relay the daily experiences of these young black men with law enforcement. Songs I have chosen to use in my writing include 2 ̆ 2 Fuck Tha Police 2 ̆ 2 (1988), 2 ̆ 2 Gangsta Gangsta 2 ̆ 2 (1989), and 2 ̆ 2 We Had to Tear This Muthafucka Up 2 ̆ 2 (1992). I chose these songs because they give the most forward accounts of the intersection of police and rap culture or because they manipulate the feelings that surfaced following the beating and reached their zenith during the riots. There are two memoirs I will examine to understand the context of the Rodney King beating and subsequently the riots. The first is the memoir of Rodney King, The Riot Within, which gives me great insight into what happened during the beating and the rioting from the central figure of both events. [13] The other memoir I will study is Presumed Guilty: the Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair. It conveys the perspective of Stacey Koon, the police officer who tasered Rodney King twice and abetted his beating. [14] This memoir is valuable to my project because it offers insight into culture of the LAPD. Another source that will give me both quantitative and qualitative information to use to analyze the culture of the LAPD. The Report of the Independent Commission on the LAPD presents statistical data about crime reporting and response as well as testimony of police officers and transcripts of the communication between officers. [15] The Commission collected this data while investigating abuses of police force by the LAPD, and the investigation resulted solely because of George Holliday 2 ̆ 7 s nationally broadcasted footage of the King beating. Finally I will analyze a myriad of articles from newspapers and magazines. [16] I will primarily look at music and rap related magazines to help contextualize NWA 2 ̆ 7 s music. I will be able to see how influential they were as well as read their own words to see how they viewed their music. In terms of newspapers I will study primarily the Los Angeles Times in order to get a sense of how the riots played out and how the media framed the objects of my thesis: the beating, the acquittals, the riots, and the music. My project will contribute to our understanding of gangsta rap and the LA riots in several ways. I will explain how gangsta rap culture critiques the oppressive LAPD culture in order to contextualize a style of music that many people do not understand. While many scholars and contemporary journalists have condemned gangsta rap for its vulgarity, sexism, and negativity, I examine it as both a cultural source and legitimate form of political activism. By treating seriously a popular culture source that shaped local and national perceptions of minority lifestyles and political frustration, my work will bridge a gap in historical scholarship between music history, cultural history, and political history to show the important connection between the values expressed in gangsta rap and their ultimate fomentation in the form of the LA riots.
