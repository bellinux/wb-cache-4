500|$|FiringSquad said Freelancers {{multiplayer}} mode encapsulated the [...] "best {{and worst}} of [...] in a nutshell": although players can move their characters anywhere, group with others for missions, and trade ships and equipment, they have very little else {{to do in the}} unchanging virtual galaxy. [...] Despite these limitations, Stratos Group said the joy of playing with real-life counterparts is a positive factor; the NPC pilots are so inept that human-controlled pilots outperform them most of the time. [...] However, as the missions are practically the same, IGN and GameCritics.com questioned the point of playing them repeatedly with friends. [...] Furthermore, IGN thought it was meaningless to amass wealth and higher-grade equipment when they cannot be transferred to other servers. [...] The lack of substance and repetitiveness led the gaming site to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Freelancer can be viable as a commercial multiplayer product. [...] Whereas massively multiplayer online games such as EverQuest have thousands of players in a vast playing area, Freelancer can accommodate only up to 128; the loneliness of playing in such a sparsely populated virtual world gave UGO concern as well over the longevity of Freelancers multiplayer mode.|$|E

60|$|As {{he ended}} she sighed, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{it would be}} before he told her what she knew was in his heart.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Twemlow murmured condolences. Mr. Beach's set {{expression}} was {{of one who}} is <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the strain of existence can be supported.|$|R
60|$|And the veiled lady {{is still}} waiting for you up-stairs. You <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> she will stop, also what will happen after she is gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "That boat {{must have}} at least two hundred dollars' worth aboard," [...] I calculated. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it took to get the load?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bullen," [...] Hallett said, {{the next}} morning, [...] "here we are again. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> we shall get to rest our wearied bodies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will step}} inside?" [...] I asked awkwardly, and while I spoke I was <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{it would be}} before the earl's {{excitement}} broke out.|$|R
60|$|It {{was well}} he said that, for I was {{thinking}} how elaborately everything was planned. I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{he had the}} scheme in his head.|$|R
60|$|Mannering turned {{abruptly}} {{round and}} looked {{her in the}} face. He had been gazing out of the window, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would be before Hester returned.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{they have}} taken all the extra harness as well," [...] added Chet, his black eyes {{snapping}} angrily. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> ago this happened." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{that proves}} {{we are on}} the right trail!" [...] cried Roger, joyfully. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> ago it was when he threw the paper away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{like you}} when you're ironical," [...] Mrs. Halliday rejoined, {{and looking up}} saw that Evelyn had come in. She <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the girl had been there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> you {{would remain in}} that trance, Mr. Crocker," [...] she said. [...] "Is it {{too much to ask}} what you were {{thinking}} of?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I keep <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{until my}} own date with the executioner will arrive, I wish I were dead right now, but I'm not. Death {{would be a}} welcome relief." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the fine}} weather continues, and we <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> a time must elapse ere our mutineers eat up their mysterious food and are starved back to work.|$|E

60|$|I {{replied that}} I had enjoyed it exceedingly, {{and looked at}} Mr. Marx, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he meant to stay. I had taken a sudden but strong dislike to Mr. Isaacs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Gwendolen, indifferently, finding {{all places}} alike undescribable {{as soon as}} she {{imagined}} herself and her husband in them. [...] "I only <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> you would like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{talk about}} the job first," [...] said Dave, {{trying to keep his}} wits about him, {{although}} he was terribly disturbed. He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would be before Phil would return.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> I am {{to keep it}} over?" [...] he said. [...] "It is a queer {{sensation}} steering {{without having}} an idea which way you are going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess he's used to that. He don't seem {{to expect}} to be looked at. Well! we're all just where we started. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it will keep up." ...|$|E

60|$|Soon he bade Marguerite good-night. She {{was tired}} out, body and soul, and he--her {{faithful}} friend--vaguely <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{she would be}} able to withstand the strain of so much sorrow, such unspeakable misery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said, [...] "now we {{are getting}} to the point. I have been <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would take you to see it, Allan, {{but if you are}} slow, you are sure." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{found no}} answer. I was <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Ortheris, {{in the bank}} of the river, would hold out, and whether I should be forced to help him to desert, as I had given my word.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a fine}} prospect, truly," [...] remarked Fred, as he {{sank down}} on one of the stools. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> we'll have to stay in this hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{this is too}} bad!" [...] {{he murmured}} to himself, as, too weak to stand longer, he sank down on the floor. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> I have been riding?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P.P.S. I {{hear that}} the Sahara {{flotation}} was really a success, notwithstanding the Judge attacks. Sir Robert and my uncle have made millions. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they will keep them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Disbelief in {{the power}} of {{language}} to convey the experience of being is dispiriting fare, and such propositions are contentiously pressed. One <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> failure, unrelieved by humor or compassion, can continue as the occasion for Brodsky's art.|$|R
60|$|The air in {{the hold}} was {{stifling}} and soon I breathed with difficulty. I longed for a drink of water, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> I could stand being in the place should those on deck forget I was there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{you meant}} {{to stay in}} that damned place"--one of the freedoms he had assumed as a husband being {{the use of his}} strongest epithets. Gwendolen, turning to see the rest of the party approach, said-- ...|$|R
