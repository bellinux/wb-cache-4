2500|$|Today anchors {{started out}} as [...] "Communicators". Creator Pat Weaver envisioned a person whose {{responsibilities}} would go {{beyond the bounds of}} traditional sit-down news anchors. The Communicator would interview, report, moderate dialogue and generally tie the show together into a coherent whole. Garroway and his successors have all followed that model, with little variation. Today, the hosts are expected to do much the same, and on any given day <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> correspondents, newsmakers and lifestyle experts; introduce and close each half-hour; conduct special segments (such as cooking or fashion) and go on-assignment to host the program from different locations. Although the [...] "Communicator" [...] nomenclature has since dropped out of favor, the job remains largely the same.|$|E
