5|$|Asipatravana/Asipatrakanana (forest of sword leaves): The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana reserve this {{hell for}} a person who digresses from the {{religious}} teachings of the Vedas and indulges in heresy. The Vishnu Purana states that wanton tree-felling leads to this hell. Yamadutas beat them with <b>whips</b> {{as they try to}} run away in the forest where palm trees have swords as leaves. Afflicted with injury of <b>whips</b> and swords, they faint and cry out for help in vain.|$|E
5|$|Octocorallia {{comprises}} the sea pens (Pennatulacea), soft corals (Alcyonacea), and blue coral (Helioporacea). Sea <b>whips</b> and sea fans, known as gorgonians, {{are part of}} Alcyonacea and historically were divided into separate orders.|$|E
5|$|Taptasurmi/Taptamurti (red-hot iron statue): A man {{or woman}} who indulges in illicit sexual {{relations}} with a woman or man is beaten by <b>whips</b> and forced to embrace red-hot iron figurines of the opposite sex.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the book}} The Chain <b>Whip,</b> this may refer to the hard <b>whip</b> (more akin to a {{truncheon}} than a multi-section <b>whip)</b> due to the ambiguity in the Chinese. [...] "Both the hard <b>whip</b> and the soft <b>whip</b> can both be referred to simply as <b>whip</b> (鞭) in Chinese.". Different books make wildly differing claims {{about the history of}} the Chain <b>Whip.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>whip</b> cracker spins the <b>whip</b> {{anti-clockwise}} (if right-handed) {{over his}} or her head. When the <b>whip</b> is approximately 90 degrees {{to the right of}} the <b>whip</b> cracker, he or she swings the <b>whip</b> in the opposite direction. It is one of the simplest techniques, yet it can be one of the loudest used in <b>whip</b> cracking.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>whipping</b> is the {{simplest}} type of <b>whipping</b> knot, {{a series of}} knots intended to stop a rope from unravelling. As it can slip off the rope easily, the common <b>whipping</b> {{should not be used}} for rope ends that will be handled. This <b>whipping</b> knot is also called 'wolf' <b>whipping</b> {{in some parts of the}} world. The 'Hangman's knot' is a variation of this <b>whipping</b> knot.|$|R
5|$|At the 2008 general election, the Fifth Labour Government, led by Helen Clark, was {{defeated}} by John Key's National Party. Following Clark's election-night resignation, Phil Goff was unanimously elected as the party's leader, with Annette King as deputy, and Darren Hughes and Steve Chadwick as the senior and junior <b>whips,</b> respectively. The party lost more support in the 26 November 2011 general election; its popular vote dipped to 27% – its worst-ever result under the mixed-member proportional representation system – and its number of MPs was reduced from forty-three to thirty-four. On 29 November 2011, Goff and King announced their resignations, effective 13 December. New <b>whips</b> also had to be chosen because Rick Barker (who replaced Hughes as the senior whip in April 2011, following Hughes leaving Parliament) and Chadwick were not re-elected to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend {{in such a way}} that the tip of the flagellum <b>whips</b> in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea <b>whips),</b> and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
50|$|By 1994, {{all three}} major {{parties in the}} House of Representatives had a <b>whip</b> and a deputy <b>whip,</b> but only the National Party's deputy <b>whip</b> did not receive an {{additional}} salary. On 12 May 1994, Kim Beazley, then the Leader of the House, announced that, {{in conjunction with the}} creation of the second debating chamber, the Government <b>Whip</b> in the House of Representatives would become the Chief Government <b>Whip,</b> and his deputy would become the Government <b>Whip.</b> In addition, a second junior <b>whip</b> would be added. Beazley offered the same arrangement for the Liberal Party and to see that the Nationals' deputy received a salary. Labor elected its <b>whip</b> that day, and the Liberals appointed an additional <b>whip</b> on 2 June 1994, with the new <b>whip</b> responsible for business in the second chamber.|$|R

5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea <b>whips).</b> These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E

Chris Hipkins and Darien Fenton were chosen as the senior and junior <b>whips,</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, a {{statement}} was made anonymously {{on behalf of}} some Pussy Riot members that both Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were no longer members. However, both were among the group that performed as Pussy Riot during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, where group members were attacked with <b>whips</b> and pepper spray by Cossacks who were employed as security guards. On 6 March 2014, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were assaulted and sprayed with green paint by local youths in Nizhny Novgorod.|$|E

The Liberals {{followed}} suit in November 1974 Labor added a second deputy in August 1985, {{pointing out that}} its <b>whipping</b> operation would then match the Coalitions (which had a Liberal <b>whip</b> and deputy and a National Party <b>whip).</b> Liberal added a second <b>whip</b> in 2009, while in opposition.|$|R
5|$|Will (Matthew Morrison) and Shelby {{agree to}} hold a mash-up {{competition}} between the New Directions and the Troubletones. Santana (Naya Rivera) takes the rivalry very seriously, and taunts and derides her former New Directions teammates—particularly Finn. He challenges Santana and the other Troubletones to a game of dodgeball. Finn and Santana are the last two people standing, until Santana <b>whips</b> a ball at Finn's face, and wins the game. Despite having won, Santana violently targets Rory (Damian McGinty), and makes his nose bleed.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the <b>whips</b> could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|Heralds {{could have}} {{attributed}} to Jesus the harp for arms inherited as {{a descendant of}} David. Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, {{and it was so}} used by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments of the Passion. These instruments were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in a seal from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown of thorns, sponge and <b>whips.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main reason was that the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable reason was that the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief <b>whips</b> were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E
5|$|Mushers {{must start}} the race with at most {{fourteen}} dogs and finish with {{no fewer than}} six. Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog <b>whips</b> and forced feeding are forbidden. Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be {{under the influence of}} performance-enhancing substances such as steroids. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind <b>whips</b> up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E

Aggie (<b>Whip's</b> cousin) warns <b>Whip</b> not to go against Ridge, but <b>Whip</b> wants revenge. Taylor and <b>Whip</b> suffered marital problems when she found herself drawn to Ridge once again. <b>Whip</b> accuses Taylor of always making Brooke look back. Taylor later consumes hallucinogenic berries that Thomas brought back from the island he and Brooke were trapped on.

50|$|To date, Cool <b>Whip</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{preferred}} <b>whipped</b> topping brands in the USA. A survey conducted in early 2015 across 24,000 American households evaluated consumption of <b>whipped</b> topping brands between 2011 and early 2015. The results determined that Cool <b>Whip</b> was the preferred <b>whipped</b> topping product, accounting for nearly 45% of respondents for all periods in the survey. Reddi-wip (<b>whipped</b> cream in an aerosol can) was a distant second in this survey, showing an 18% preference from survey respondents.|$|R
5|$|The {{ships were}} well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, {{and the only}} demand of mutineers—led by João Cândido Felisberto—was the {{abolition}} of what they called slavery: they objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training, and punishments including bolo (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) {{and the use of}} <b>whips</b> or lashes (chibata), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.|$|E

He ended the 1966–67 season with nine goals in 11 games for Wolves, and helped the club to secure {{promotion}} to the First Division. He spent the summer of 1967 in the United States playing for the Los Angeles Wolves in the United Soccer Association, scoring three goals in eleven games to help Wolves to win the West Division title and then captained the side and scored a goal as they beat the Washington <b>Whips</b> 6–5 in the USA Final at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then <b>whips</b> off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E
