5|$|Larter defined Clear {{as a girl}} who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, and has made a life within that. She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's holding to her grip for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her sex appeal, something she's insecure about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E
25|$|As in the past, most {{handcrafted}} products {{produced in}} Mexico are still consumed domestically in everyday family life, especially {{items such as}} clothes, kitchen utensils and the like, as well as ceremonial and religious objects. Much of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> knows as Mexican craft was promoted in the 1920s and is considered luxurious, with Talavera pottery as an example. Tradition survives {{in the production of}} many of these products. Only five percent of Mexico’s artisans employ innovative methods in production, design and promotion with success. 65% continue making their crafts with little, if any, differences from their ancestors and 30% are somewhere in between.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the University Extension was {{strictly}} {{a liberal arts}} program with no intention of offering professional programs. [...] In 1971, however, it was recognized that [...] "our charter is too narrow, our staff too small" [...] for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> needed in that day and age, and a committee was appointed by President Derek Bok to review the [...] "structure and purpose of Extension." ...|$|E

[...] However, she stated that if Schwartz and Savage were interested in creating a different Gossip Girl spin-off, CW would [...] "of course [...] be open to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali Larter, {{who starred}} in the 1999 film Varsity Blues, was cast as female lead Clear Rivers. [...] "The film shows {{how easy it is}} to turn on someone, to blame someone when you're scared," [...] Larter said. [...] "It's also about trusting your intuitions and yourself". She defined her part as [...] "that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself, and had made a life within that. She's an artist, she lives by herself, and she's kinda holding to her grip for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> has given her".|$|E

500|$|Spence D. from IGN Music {{commented that}} the song is the coolest song on the album up to this point. Paul Rees from Q {{magazine}} complemented the track as a [...] "conventional rock song, filled with drama, darkness and surprises". USA Todays Edna Gunderson said that the [...] "funkified" [...] synth-pop of [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] attests to Madonna's [...] "undiminished" [...] skills as a shrewd pop composer. Yahoo! Music's Dan Genoe commented that Madonna has a personality crisis in the song. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice gave the song a mixed review, writing: [...] "It mutes slightly the slaphappy beats of Mirwais's own club hit [...] "Disco Science" [...] to make vague digs at the press and defensively vow self-improvement. Madonna's voice is mixed and diced into baby gurgles, {{which might have been}} cute if it weren't so redundant." [...] John Payne from LA Weekly deduced that even within the synth sounds of the song, he could see [...] "real feeling deeply ingrained in this particular icon. 'Why should I care <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> thinks of me?' That is, yes, she does care <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> thinks of her. She says she’ll just withdraw from the public eye, ’cause who needs this, huh?" [...] Conversely, Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, gave a negative review saying that [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] might be the silliest track that Madonna had ever recorded.|$|E
500|$|Although Sony did {{not release}} the track as a single, it was {{confirmed}} that [...] "This Is It" [...] {{would be released}} to radio stations for airplay, but {{that it would not be}} downloadable. Sony chose to release the song as an album-only track as part of a strategy to encourage fans to buy the entire album. McClain, also a co-producer of the This Is It album said, [...] "This song only defines, once again, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> already knows -- that Michael [...] is one of God's greatest gifts." [...] "This Is It" [...] premiered, as scheduled, on Jackson's official website MichaelJackson.com on October 12 at midnight.|$|E
500|$|Sidney Colvin, in his 1917 {{biography}} on Keats, grouped [...] "Indolence" [...] {{with the}} other 1819 odes in categorizing Keats's [...] "class of achievements". In 1948, Lord Gorell described the fifth stanza as, [...] "lacking the magic of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> agrees are the great Odes" [...] but describes the language as [...] "elicate, charming even". Later, in a 1968 biography of Keats, Gittings describes {{the importance of the}} poem: [...] "The whole ode, in fact, has a borrowed air, and he acknowledged its lack of success by not printing it {{with the other}}s... Yet with its acceptance of the numb, dull and indolent mood as something creative, it set the scene for all the odes that followed." ...|$|E

500|$|David Crosby portrays {{himself in}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the episode as the 12-step sponsor for Lionel Hutz. During Marge's trial for shoplifting, prosecutors show the Zapruder film and assert that Marge was present on the grassy knoll when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The scene where Maude Flanders peers {{through a hole in}} a wall at Marge is a reference to the 1960 film Psycho. In Lionel Hutz's dream of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> would be like without lawyers, the writers had wanted to use the song [...] "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing" [...] which was used in Coca-Cola advertisements, but they could not get the rights to it. Instead, they used a similar instrumental theme.|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{was an avid}} music lover, most {{interested}} in Baroque and Renaissance music. She sang in choral groups {{for most of her}} life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on the TV show Uranium, Dio stated that the [...] "dragon" [...] of the album title refers to technology. He expressed concern with it threatening society in the future. Dio elaborated that the title track refers to [...] "those who perpetrate injustices and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is doing to stop them. In fantasy tales, dragons were notorious for stealing children and feeding them to their babies. During {{the first part of}} the song, I sing 'Someone has taken a child.' The second part is about a cruel feudal lord. The third part is about 'electronic serfdom.'" [...] He also expressed [...] belief that the computer has become a god in modern society. [...] "It is a small god with an electrical heart (...) It is time to rebel against it." ...|$|E

500|$|Wolters was perturbed by an {{interview}} with Speer published in Der Spiegel in November 1966, in which Speer, while again taking responsibility for crimes of the Nazi era, blamed Hitler, rather than Germany, for starting World War II. Wolters wrote to Speer on November 30, describing Speer's assignment of blame as a [...] "dangerous oversimplification made entirely from today's perspective... You will surely remember that in 1939 we were all {{of the opinion that}} Hitler was Germany. Although we were certainly depressed rather than enthusiastic about the war in Poland, we surely considered that the responsibility for it was {{to be found in the}} provocative conduct by the Poles, and it was the British who made of it a world war." [...] Wolters asked Speer to [...] "concentrate wholly on what really happened, leaving aside <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> thinks of it now".|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Mukerji {{appeared}} in Pradeep Sarkar's crime thriller Mardaani, {{in which she}} played the lead role of Shivani Shivaji Roy, a Maharashtrian policewoman involved in a kidnapping case that leads her to uncover secrets of human trafficking in India. She took on the role [...] "to show all girls what the reality is, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> has come to, and how they need to protect themselves". In preparation, she interacted with senior officials of Mumbai's crime branch, and learned the Israeli self-defense technique of Krav Maga. Rajeev Masand found Mukerji to be the prime asset of the film, adding that by [...] "investing Shivani with both physical strength and emotional courage, she gives us a hero that's hard not to root for". Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra also praised her performance, writing that she not only [...] "imbues Shivani with steely resolve but also gives her emotional depth". The film was a commercial success and garnered Mukerji another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Boyle started {{brainstorming}} {{ideas with}} designer Mark Tildesley, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce and costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They considered [...] "what was essentially British", with the non-British Larlarb {{able to offer}} a view of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> thought Britain meant. Cottrell Boyce had given Boyle a copy of Pandaemonium, (named after the capital of Hell in Paradise Lost) by Humphrey Jennings, which collated contemporary reports from the industrial revolution. [...] It had become traditional during the opening ceremony to 'produce' the Olympic rings in a spectacular manner. Cottrell Boyce commented [...] "Danny had a very clear idea {{that in the first}} 15 minutes you had to have a great, startling image that could go around the world; it had to climax with something that made people go 'Oh my God!'". [...] Boyle decided that [...] "the journey from the pastoral to the industrial, ending with the forging of the Olympic rings" [...] would be that image.|$|E
