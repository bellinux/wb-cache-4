5|$|The {{remainder}} of the regiments carried a red banner displaying the Columns of Gediminas. Those that bore the Vytis, {{also known as the}} Pahonia, were armies from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while those <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> the Columns of Gediminas were from noble families of Lithuania. Until the end of the 18th century, when it was annexed by the Russian Empire, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania used the Vytis as its flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} of Germany's {{military presence in}} Serbia resulted in {{a new wave of}} mass executions and war crimes. The commanders <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> the most responsibility for these atrocities were primarily of Austrian origin and had served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Most were ardently anti-Serb, a prejudice that the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch links to the Nazis' wider anti-Slavic racism.|$|E

5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a casino}} in the 1920s, the Rosendale Theater {{was seized by}} the village and {{converted}} into a theater in 1949 by Anthony Cacchio, a man <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> a strong resemblance to filmmaker Otto Preminger. The first film shown on opening night in February 1949 was Blood on the Moon. Caccio owned the building outright by 1954, and operated it with his son, Anthony Cacchio Jr., who banned popcorn in the theater in 1969. The theater served as the village's fire department at one point.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi regime {{promoted}} a liberal {{code of conduct}} regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> children out of wedlock. Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. The same {{was the case for}} married women, who liaised with soldiers, civilians or slave labourers. For example, sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer. Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's second wife, Anna of Celje, {{had died}} in 1416, leaving a daughter, Jadwiga. In 1417, Władysław married Elisabeth of Pilica, who died in 1420 without bearing him a child, and two years later, Sophia of Halshany, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> him two {{surviving}} sons. The death in 1431 of his daughter Jadwiga, the last heir of Piast blood, released Władysław to make his sons by Sophia of Halshany his heirs, though he had to sweeten the Polish nobles with concessions to ensure their agreement, since the monarchy was elective.|$|E
5|$|After Anne Hyde's death, a {{portrait}} of her painted by Willem Wissing was commissioned by the future Mary II; this used to hang above {{the door of the}} Queen's Drawing Room of the Garden House at Windsor Castle. Two years {{after the death of his}} first wife, James married a Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> James Francis Edward, James' only son to survive to adulthood. James became king of England, Ireland, and Scotland in 1685, but was deposed during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The throne was then offered by Parliament to Anne's eldest daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange. After Mary died in 1694 and William in 1702, Anne Hyde's daughter Anne became queen of the three kingdoms and, in 1707, the first sovereign of the united Kingdom of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012–2015 {{revealed that}} Nyuserre Ini undertook building {{works on the}} valley temple of Menkaure, as witness by numerous seal impressions bearing his serekh discovered on the site. These works ended a long period from the reign of Shepseskaf until his reign during which the Giza necropolis was not the object of royal attention. Beyond Menkaure's valley temple, Nyuserre apparently also took a wider interest {{in the administration of}} the pyramid town of Khafra and revived the cult of both Menkaure and queen Khentkaus I. According to Mark Lehner, this queen, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> the same name as Nyuserre's mother and like his mother bore two pharaohs, provided Nyuserre with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of both Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefre's death.|$|E
5|$|Biko married Ntsiki Mashalaba in December 1970. They had two {{children}} together: Nkosinathi, born in 1971, and Samora, born in 1975. Biko's wife chose the name Nkosinathi ("The Lord is with us"), and Biko named their second child after the Mozambican revolutionary leader Samora Machel. Angered by her husband's serial adultery, Mashalaba ultimately moved out of their home, {{and by the time}} of his death, she had begun divorce proceedings. Biko had also begun an extra-marital relationship with Mamphela Ramphele. In 1974, she bore him a daughter, Lerato, who died after two months. A son, Hlumelo, was born to Ramphele in 1978, after Biko's death. Biko was also in a relationship with Lorrain Tabane, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> him a child named Motlatsi in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In April 1952 Sihanouk married Paule Monique Izzi, the {{daughter}} of Pomme Peanga Cambodian lady, and Jean-François Izzi, a French banker of Italian ancestry.

Before his marriage to Monique, Sihanouk had married five other women including Phat Kanhol, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, Sisowath Monikessan, Mam Manivan Phanivong, and Thavet Norleak. Monikessan died of childbirth in 1946, and his marriages to the other women all ended in divorce.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first {{five years in the}} hamlet of Anchiano in the home of his mother, and from 1457 lived in the {{household}} of his father, grandparents and uncle {{in the small town of}} Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children: Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (<b>who</b> <b>bore</b> him another six children: Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni).|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's {{coat of arms}} {{was unusually}} complex for the period, with seven {{different}} quarterings.

5|$|Thi {{lived in}} the American capital until 1975, {{when he moved to}} Arkansas. He {{lived in the}} {{southern}} state for a short period before settling in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

According to his relatives, Thi remained popular among the Vietnamese American community, most of whom had come to the US after the fall of Saigon and were stridently anti-communist. His family said their refugee compatriots often recognized him, and usually refused to let him pay for meals at their restaurants. Thi's second marriage, to Oanh Nguyen, ended in divorce. They had five children, four sons and a daughter. He later remarried, to Catherine Nguyen, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> him a daughter. In all, Thi had six children and 12 grandchildren.

5|$|Clan MacAulay dates, with certainty, to the 16th century. The clan {{was engaged}} in several feuds with {{neighbouring}} clans. However, the clan's fortunes declined in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the decline and fall of Clan MacAulay, which ended {{with the death of}} Aulay MacAulay in the mid-18th century, the clan became dormant. With the revival of interest in Scottish clans in the 20th century a movement was organised to revive Clan MacAulay. The modern organisation strove to unite the three unrelated groups of MacAulays, and all <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> the surname MacAulay, under one clan and chief. In 2002, the clan appointed a potential chief of Clan MacAulay, but his petition for formal recognition was denied by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The Lord Lyon ruled that the petitioner did not meet two criteria: anyone without a blood link to a past chief must be Clan Commander for ten years before being considered for recognition, and that the chiefship in question was of the MacAulays of Ardincaple and not of all MacAulays. To date, Clan MacAulay does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, and therefore can be considered an Armigerous clan.|$|E
5|$|In the Bibliotheca, the Arcadian genealogies are {{immediately}} {{followed by the}} Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror {{the structure of the}} Catalogue because other fragments of the papyrus roll that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of Atlas' daughters: Taygete, Electra, Alcyone, Sterope, Celaeno, Maia and Merope. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene. Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of Lacedaemon, through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including Tyndareos, the father of Helen, and Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. To Zeus yet again Electra bore Dardanus, the progenitor of the Trojan line, and Eetion, who was killed for sleeping with Demeter. Dardanus' sons were Erichthonius and Ilus. Hyrieus and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter Antiope, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> Amphion and Zethus to Zeus. Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in Euboea, but not before bearing Abas, the eponym of the Abantes. His line is traced down to Elephenor, leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War. Sterope lay with Ares and bore Oenomaus, but it is possible that this union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of Pelops and Oenomaus' daughter Hippodameia.|$|E
5|$|Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the {{marriage}} bore one child, Amanda. Rosaleen never watched Lawton play football during their ten-year marriage. Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. He would not hear from his daughter until she was convicted of stealing from playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen was on her fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, <b>who</b> <b>bore</b> him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E
