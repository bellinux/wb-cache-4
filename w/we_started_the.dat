Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> <b>The</b> rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The roar of the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

That was the turning point as <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> new wave rock, and the band was taking a roller-coaster in music searching for something out of the ordinary”, says Sigtryggur Baldursson.|$|E

Rajamouli used those birds in several shots. Upon finishing the stages of the stadium composite, Kamalakannan flew to Iran again to work with Adel for the 3D city shots which were created entirely in CG. Adili designed 3D horses for the hero and villain and Draper {{designed the}} 3D people flocking behind the horses. About Adili's work, Kamalakannan said, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> city-shot renders, it has taken several hours to render one frame.

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> casting process, and all I saw was a lot of people who couldn't play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E

Djawadi {{has worked on}} the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created {{for the beginning of}} the episode, titled [...] "Light of the Seven", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, [...] "The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience.

In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , and then when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E

In 2011, Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement's development, saying [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> band, the problem was we didn’t belong anywhere. Because we were playing very heavy music, we were wearing tons of make-up and crazy outfits. So we couldn’t belong anywhere", [...] " [...] that eventually became visual kei." [...] He added [...] "But visual kei is more like a spirit, it’s not a music style or, you know... I think it is a freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, that’s what I believe visual kei is." [...] Upon former guitarist hide's death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, Billboards Steve McClure declared it [...] "the end of an era", explaining [...] "X were the first generation of visual kei bands For the next generation of bands, it's like: That's it.

500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then we knew we were also accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, although I think it still less than 50% of our general fan base." ...|$|E
