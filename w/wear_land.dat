40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} special {{model for the}} chip forming process based on a simple shear plane cutting model, which determines {{temperature}} distribution on the <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> of cutting tools. The propriety of the model is verifed by comparing the calculated temperature with the measured one, which is obtained {{by means of a}} special micro-thermocouple technique. The results obtained are as follows : (1) Moving the shear plane forward and downward from the cutting edge makes it possible {{to take into account the}} distributions of heat sources and velocities in the primary shear zone. (2) The profile of temperatures on the <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> is the same as that on the rake face, while both the maximum temperature and the difference between max. and min. temperatures are lower than those on the rake face. (3) The distribution of frictional tress on　the <b>wear</b> <b>land</b>　is uniform, and the magnitude is nearly half the maximum frictional stress on the rake face. (4) When cutting 0. 46 ％C carbon steel with a worn carbide cutting tool having a <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> length of 0. 6 mm, the Temperature on　the workpiece surface rises 60 K at a cutting speed of 3. 33 m/s.

40|$|In {{the field}} of ultra-precision machining, {{the study of the}} {{relation}} between chip morphology and tool wear is significant, since tool wear characteristics can be reflected by morphologies of cutting chips. In this research, the relation between chip morphology and tool flank wear is first investigated in UPRM. A cutting experiment was performed to explore chip morphologies under different widths of flank <b>wear</b> <b>land.</b> A geometric model was developed to identify the width of flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> based on chip morphology. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the occurrence of tool flank wear can make the cutting chips truncated at both their cut-in and cut-out sides, and reduce the length of cutting chips in the feed direction. The width of truncation positions of the cutting chip can be measured and used to calculate the width of flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> {{with the help of the}} mathematical model.

40|$|In this paper, a new auto-regressive {{algorithm}} is proposed to reconstruct 3 D topographic surface for diamond tool wear, using its in-process image. First, based on digital image processing technique, tool wear lands are separated from a tool wear image captured by a CCD camera under a 100 X optical system; Second, a traverse search method of arc translation is put forward to eliminate feigned wear lands, and a least square polynomial method is adopted to fit inner-and outer-contours of the wear lands, self-adaptively filtering noises and connecting the discontinuous wear lands; Finally, the auto-regressive calibration method is developed to reconstruct its 3 D topographic surface. The <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> is extracted self-adaptively, and the wear area, maximal wear width, average wear width and worn volume can be determined automatically by the algorithm. The reconstructed 3 D topography of the tool <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> can be identified, based on the tool wear image captured by SEM. The result indicates that the method is capable of reconstructing 3 D topography of the tool <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> and provides a possibility for in-process 3 D-wear measurement in ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) and the algorithm reliability is validated finally.

40|$|In {{turning of}} {{platinum}} alloy Pt 850, the wear behavior of tools and the cutting characteristics of Pt 850 are investigated experimentally. K 10 carbide, cermet, ceramics and PCD {{are used as}} tool materials. K 10 carbide and cermet are not suitable for the cutting of this material because severe wear on the tool flank was observed after a few second of cutting, that is, {{the width of the}} flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> was about 1 mm after 10 seconds cutting. The width of <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> of Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4 ceramic tools was small compared with K 10 carbide tool, but the cutting forces increased rapidly as the cutting proceed. PCD tool can be used for cutting of Pt 850 because the width of flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> is much small compared with other tool materials used in this experiment and the increasing rate of cutting force is not so great. The influence of cutting speed on the flank wear of PCD tool is small.

For comparison tests with conventional fluid supply method have been carried out. Gears have been generated with full depth of cut and with two axial feed with constant cutting speed value. During hobbing cutting forces have been measured by experimental stand. Tool wear has been measured directly as a width of flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> of the hob cutter teeth.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{theoretical}} and experimental studies {{are carried out}} to investigate the intrinsic relationship between tool flank wear and operational conditions in metal cutting processes using carbide cutting inserts. A new flank wear rate model, which combines cutting mechanics simulation and an empirical model, is developed to predict tool flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> width. A set of tool wear cutting tests using hard metal coated carbide cutting inserts are performed under different operational conditions. The wear of the cutting inset is evaluated and recorded using Zygo New View 5000 microscope.

The wear constants in the proposed wear rate model are determined based on the machining data and simulation results. A good agreements between the predicted and measured tool flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> width show that the developed tool wear model can accurately predict tool flank wear to some extent...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of tool wear can affect cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality in ultra-precision fly cutting (UPFC), {{there has been no}} research in this area due to the complex cutting mechanism of UPFC. The theoretical and experimental research described in this paper was therefore conducted to explore tool wear characteristics in UPFC and their relationship to cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality. Results from the study reveal that tool wear characteristics in UPFC include cutting edge fractures, workpiece material welding, <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> formation, sub-wear land formation, and micro-grooves. The cutting edge fractures lead to the formation of ridges on both the cutting chips and machined surface; the material welding increases the thrust force, crushes cutting chips, and deteriorates the machined surface quality; and the formation of <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> on the cutting edge makes the machined surface burred and fuzzy, and the micro-grooves leave some traces on the machined surface. By analyzing the captured cutting force, it is found that the progress of tool wear in UPFC can increase the cutting force and its power spectral density at the natural frequency of the dynamometer. Findings from the research provide rich insight into the relationships of tool wear characteristics to cutting forces, chip formation, and machined surface quality in intermittent cutting processes.
