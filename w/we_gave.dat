25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> him some black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E

25|$|On September 29, 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan disputed Treaty of Lausanne. He said “We {{gave away}} the islands (in the Aegean) through the Treaty of Lausanne,”, “The islands, which if we care to shout (from the western Asia Minor coast) we’ll {{be heard on}} the other side (the islands), <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> away with Lausanne. What will now happen with the {{continental}} shelf? What will happen with the airspace and land? We’re still fighting for all of these". This caused displeasure in Athens. A Greek Foreign Ministry source remarked that “everyone should respect the Treaty of Lausanne,” noting that it is “a reality in the civilized world which no one, including Ankara, can ignore.”, added that the Turkish leader’s comments were likely geared for domestic consumption.|$|E
500|$|According to Aston Barrett, [...] "some of {{the songs}} had been {{recorded}} before, ..., in different studios and with different musicians, but <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> them that strict timing and brought the feeling out of them more." [...] "Baby We've Got a Date (Rock it Baby)" [...] is similar to [...] "Black Bitter," [...] recorded in an earlier session.|$|E
500|$|CTV Olympics {{reported}} that Olympic curlers largely enjoyed the episode. American men's team coach Phill Drobnick said [...] "The team watched {{it together and}} <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> it two thumbs up, they {{did a great job}} and it was reaching out to a new audience for our sport, so that's always great for us too." [...] American team alternate Chris Plys said [...] "They didn't make a mockery of the sport, which is nice. Curling catches a lot of abuse." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1966 European Cup Winners' Cup Final was 1–1 after 90 minutes. Borussia Dortmund won 2–1 after extra time. Shankly stated afterwards, [...] "We didn't {{play well}} and <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> away two silly goals." [...] Their FA Cup defence {{ended in the}} third round to Chelsea. They regained the League title {{on the last day of}} April 1966 with two Hunt goals to beat Chelsea [...] Yeats matched Alex Raisbeck and Donald MacKinlay as double league title winning, Scottish Liverpool captains.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Townsend lent {{his voice}} to {{characters}} in several episodes of the Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse (see Musician cameos in Metalocalypse for more). The original character design for Pickles the Drummer, one of the series' main characters, bore {{a striking resemblance to}} Townsend. The series' co-creator Brendon Small acknowledged the similarity, and altered the design before the series began. [...] "We made sure he didn't look like Devin Townsend. <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn't look like that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Apple {{successfully}} sued eMachines, whose eOne {{too closely}} resembled the then-new iMac's trade dress. The eOne {{was taken off}} the market, resulting in eMachines' losing the ability to sell the eOne as intended. In eMachines' EDGAR statement for May 1, 2001, eMachines stated that its [...] "net loss for the first quarter of 2001 was $31.1 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to a loss of $11.9 million, or $0.13 per share, {{in the first quarter of}} 2000", and that these results [...] "reflect the substantial discounts and incentives that <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> to retailers to enable liquidation of product inventories".|$|E

500|$|The group re-recorded {{the song}} for the Rio album {{a few months later}} at London's AIR Studios with {{producer}} Colin Thurston, who also recorded the hits [...] "Too Shy" [...] for Kajagoogoo, and [...] "I Want Candy" [...] for Bow Wow Wow. Andy Taylor remembers: [...] "He was a great organizer and arranger, <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> him far more ideas and music than the track actually needed, and he was important in the process of whittling them down to the essential elements." [...] Thurston and the band decided to keep the demo's original electronic backing track and just re-record the other instruments and vocals.|$|E
500|$|Kaif's {{paternal}} parentage {{has been questioned}} by {{some members of the}} film industry. In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: [...] "We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too... religious?... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great". Kaif called Shroff's comments [...] "hurtful".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{broadcast}} of the 13th season, Parker and Stone made every episode from the previous 12 seasons of South Park available for free viewing on the official series website, South Park Studios. New episodes from the 13th season were made available for {{one week after the}} original airdate, then removed for 30 days, after which they were returned to the site permanently. The episodes were uncensored and ad-supported, so no membership fees were required to view the shows. In a statement, Parker and Stone said, [...] "We got really sick of having to download our own show illegally all the time. So <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> ourselves a legal alternative." ...|$|E

500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I told myself that I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} {{of the doctrine of}} substantive legitimate expectation in Singapore public law was accepted by the Court of Appeal in the case of Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor. In his judgment written on behalf of the Court, Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated that the idea behind the doctrine is that certain [...] "expectations could, in suitable circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right". Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> to life imprisonment. That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{significance}} of the fixture for the two clubs was increased by the fact that, had Arsenal avoided defeat, they would have extended their unbeaten league run to 50 matches. Wenger told reporters at his press conference that he felt no increased pressure, though added the team's midweek draw in the UEFA Champions League at Panathinaikos increased expectation. He admitted his team's behaviour in the fixture last season was unacceptable, but pointed out [...] "...the best response <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> was to win the fair play table. That meant we took responsibility for what we did and we have improved our attitude." [...] Wenger believed United's strengths lay in creativity, {{and did not want}} to set his team out to nullify, rather to [...] "...play our game based on speed and technique." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1965–66, Liverpool {{regained the}} League Championship title {{and reached the}} final of the European Cup Winner's Cup at Hampden Park, however the team lost 2–1 in extra time to Borussia Dortmund. Shankly's summary of that final, played on a wet night, was: [...] "We didn't play well and <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> away two silly goals". Shankly and Paisley had learned a great deal about European {{football}} which Liverpool would eventually turn into trophies. The strategy in the two-leg ties was [...] "containment away, attack at home". Shankly applied the principle in a preliminary round tie against Juventus when Liverpool were away in the first leg. Despite Juventus taking the lead after 81 minutes, Shankly ordered his players to ensure the deficit was only one goal. Liverpool then switched to all-out attack in the second leg at Anfield and won 2–0.|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Irwin Winkler {{stated the}} choice to film in Taiwan was due to lower costs. [...] " [...] was very, very expensive, and it was budgeted, because it takes place in 1670 in Japan. We got lucky and found out about Taipei, and in and around Taipei and Taiwan, we found great, great locations. The prices were very cheap, {{and we were able}} to make it for a price." [...] Winkler {{disclosed}} that the tight budget forced many of the cast and crew, including himself, to work for minimum pay: [...] "And all the actors, Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, everybody worked for scale. Marty worked for scale, I worked for under scale. <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> back money." [...] James Martin, a Jesuit priest and published Catholic scholar, worked closely with the filmmakers to ensure an accurate portrayal of the Jesuits.|$|E
