The <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> experiences large shear forces {{and these are}} enhanced around the bolt hole.

40|$|High {{values of}} {{residual}} stresses {{is one of}} the most common reason of breaking lots of metal constructions, including rails. These stresses can reach values of flow limit, especially in the area of faults. Estimation of residual stresses values allows to get information about technical condition <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> and also allow to avoid abnormal situations So, the aim of the research is creating the model of stress-strain state <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> which was hardened in its top and bottom, and to compare modeling results with experimental measurements of stresses and discrepancy of the housing. For creating the model and making evaluations by finite element method we used a program COMSOL. Forces on the top and bottom <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> cause tension stresses, forces on the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> cause tensile stresses. We compared calculated values of stresses with discrepancy of the housing. The discrepancy of the housing is informative characteristic for estimating the residual stresses according to standards. For experimental measurements we used an acoustic structuroscope SEMA. This structuroscope uses the acoustoelastic phenomenon for measurements. We made measurements <b>of</b> the five <b>rails.</b> According to the calculation results of the model, critical discrepancy of the housing in 2 mm corresponded to the following values of maximum stresses: – 54 MPa in the top <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> 86 MPa in the web and – 62 MPa in the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>rail.</b> Experimental measurements are the following: from – 48 MPa to – 64 MPa in the top <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> 54 MPa to 93 MPa in the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> and – 59 MPA to – 74 MPa in the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>rail.</b> Absolute error was ± 5 MPa. Thus we created the model, which allowed to analyze strain-stress state and compare real values of stresses with discrepancy of the housing.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} <b>of</b> the heavy <b>rail</b> roller straightening, the roller {{leveller}} only presses the plastic deformation on the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>rail.</b> Because the stiffness of flanges {{which are in}} both sides is stronger than the web, the heavy rail always has the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>web</b> falling. In that case, we can not achieve the desired effect of straightening by the theoretic bending deflection. In this paper, a finite element model of one straightening unit was built by the ANSYS, the straightening process was simulated and the web falling affect with the bending deflection and the roller spacing was analyzed. Some pictures of curve were drew through the relationships of bending deflection and web falling, the relationships of roller spacing and web falling. In order to gain the better straightening effect, the actual bending deflection can be {{the sum of the}} theoretical bending deflection and web falling from the curve once the roller spacing was defined...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic Guided Waves can {{propagate}} {{over long}} distances, {{and are thus}} suitable for the interrogation of long structural members such as rails. A recently developed Ultrasonic Broken Rail Detection (UBRD) system for monitoring continuously welded train rail tracks, primarily detects complete breaks. This system uses a guided wave mode with energy concentrated in the head <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> which propagates large distances and which is suitable for detecting defects in the rail head. Exploiting a second mode, with energy concentrated in the web section, {{would allow us to}} e ectively detect defects in the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this study is to develop an ultrasonic piezoelectric transducer that can excite a guided wave mode with energy concentrated in the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail.</b> It is required that the transducer must strongly excite such a mode at the operational frequency of the UBRD system. The objective is thus to obtain a design with optimal performance. A recently developed numerical modelling technique is used to model the interaction of the transducer with the rail structure. The technique employs a 2 D Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) mesh <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> cross-section and a 3 D nite element mesh of the transducer; and is thus referred to as SAFE- 3 D. The accuracy of the SAFE- 3 D method was validated though experimental measurements performed on a previously developed transducer. A design objective function representative of the energy transmitted by the transducer to the web mode was selected. The identi ed design variables were the dimensions of the transducer components. The performance of the transducer was optimized using a response surface-based optimization approach with a Latin Hypercube sampled design of experiments (DoE) that required SAFE- 3 D analyses at the sampled points. A Nelder- Mead optimization algorithm was then used to nd an optimal transducer design on the response surface. The performance of the optimal transducer predicted by the response surface was found to be in good agreement with that computed from SAFE- 3 D. The optimum transducer was manufactured and experimental measurements veri ed that the transducer model was exceptionally good. The design method adopted in this study could be used to automate the design of transducers for other sections <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> or other frequencies of operation.

The higher baseplate also supports the switch rail better. This makes a stronger switch which can be curved, reducing the jolt to the train and allowing higher speeds.

40|$|The {{continuous}} welded rails used {{in most of}} the United States lack expansion joints of any sort. This {{leads to}} a much smoother ride and a longer service life for rails and wheels, but also causes extreme temperatures to induce high stresses in these rails. In very warm conditions these stresses can incite sudden buckling <b>of</b> the <b>rails,</b> which is dangerous and difficult to predict. To alleviate these risks rail stresses need to be regularly monitored, but current practices are slow and labor intensive. This research develops a non-contact prototype apparatus designed to quickly measure longitudinal stress in rails. The measurement is performed by generating a Rayleigh wave along the surface <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> and analyzing the polarization of the Rayleigh wave some distance further down the <b>rail.</b> An evaluation <b>of</b> this measurement technique is performed on <b>rails</b> <b>of</b> varying age and surface condition in a lab environment.

This paper argues that teaching Ruby on Rails is a good choice for teaching students appropriate development habits through its rigorous application of the model-view-controller design pattern in the application code. Furthermore, productivity gains from using the Rails framework means that students can tackle more challenging issues when developing web sites. This is because most of the defaults for Rails work for everybody so developers can focus on the business logic and not the object/relational mapping of the CRUD details.

50|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{attaching}} the stainless steel to the aluminium. The oldest is a co-extruded method, where the stainless steel is extruded with the aluminium. This method has suffered, in isolated cases, from de-lamination (where the stainless steel separates from the aluminium); this {{is said to have}} been eliminated in the latest co-extruded rails. A second method is an aluminium core, upon which two stainless steel sections are fitted as a cap and linear welded along the centre line <b>of</b> the <b>rail.</b> Because aluminium has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than steel, the aluminium and steel must be positively locked to provide a good current collection interface.

40|$|Abstract- Application of guided waves {{for rail}} {{inspection}} in railroad industry is {{considered in the}} paper. They are particularly sensitive to vertical defects and they are used at relatively low frequency so they are not significantly attenuated by weld material. Dispersion curves and mode shapes for guided waves in rails were calculated using finite element technique. For the experiments a mode that only propagates in the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> at frequency less than 100 kHz was chosen. Novel transducers were designed which produce in-plane displacements. For damping of the transducers a specially designed backing material composite was used {{in order to reduce}} the ringing effect of the piezo element at low frequencies. Experiments were conducted using a single transducer and array of four transducers. Different materials were evaluated for dry-coupling of the transducers to the rail surface. The experimental prototype system enables the screening of 20 meters <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> from a single array position. Without careful design of the transduction system and a full understanding of guided wave mode behaviour, the superposition of multiple modes all travelling at different velocities will result in data that is difficult to interpret. The key to an effective and practical test is the determination of the particular guided wave modes that are required for the test and the preferential generation and detection of these modes relative to the other unwanted modes [2 - 4]. 2.

Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track under moving traffic on frequent track degradation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks, especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train.

In this study, the SAFE- 3 D model {{is used in the}} design optimization <b>of</b> a <b>rail</b> <b>web</b> transducer. A bound-constrained optimization problem was formulated to maximize the energy transmitted by the transducer in the web mode when driven by a pre-defined excitation signal.

A Latin hypercube sampled design of experiments that required a total of 500 SAFE- 3 D analyses in the design space was employed in a response surface-based optimization approach. The Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm was then used to find an optimal transducer design on the constructed response surface. The radial basis function response surface was first verified by comparing a number of predicted responses against the computed SAFE- 3 D responses. The performance of the optimal transducer predicted by the optimization algorithm on the response surface was also verified to be sufficiently accurate using SAFE- 3 D. The computational advantages of SAFE- 3 D in transducer design is noteworthy given we needed to conduct more than 500 analyses.

Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> yarns with different designs <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the jack. Load <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections.
