30|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} motion models {{that can be}} used to <b>warp</b> <b>blocks</b> between frames, such as the affine, projective, and bilinear motion models [19]. In the past, these motion models have been used in the context of predictive video codecs to obtain more accurate predictions, especially when non-translational motion is present. For example, in [20], block matching with several first-order geometric transforms was proposed and significant RD performance improvements were obtained when compared to simple translational block matching. More recently, a parametric motion representation was proposed [21] where a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracking algorithm is adopted to match correspondence points and a motion segmentation algorithm is used to compute several parameter sets for a perspective transform; then, several warped reference pictures are generated and the best is selected for the coding process. In [22], a parametric Skip mode is proposed using a parametric motion estimation algorithm with cubic spline interpolation to obtain a set of motion model parameters for each frame; these parameters describe the global motion between the current and last decoded frames. Then, a new zero-residue Skip mode makes use of the estimated parameters to obtain a new prediction that can be selected for each block (although more typically used for background areas that may be well described with global motion). In the past, advanced motion models have brought significant advances in terms of coding performance for predictive video codecs at the cost of higher encoding and decoding complexity. However, these advanced motion models have not yet been exploited in the context of distributed video codecs, i.e., SI creation solutions employing advanced motion models based on geometric transforms to perform the SI frame interpolation are not available in the literature.|$|R

The NCG also is used to choose robust blocks. To embed the watermark information the chosen blocks are changed by geometric warping. To extract the watermark, the original video is not necessary. The NCG is used to detect the watermarked blocks and compute the embedded watermark bit. In some cases, the independent geometric <b>warping</b> of <b>blocks</b> which contain the same object results in visible artifacts. We propose to link blocks {{in space and time}} to block groups.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the development of}} a new framework for the construction of motion compensated wavelet transforms for highly scalable video compression. The current authors recently proposed a motion adaptive wavelet transform based on motioncompensated lifting steps. This approach overcomes several limitations of existing methods. In particular, frame <b>warping</b> and <b>block</b> displacement methods cannot efficiently exploit complex motion without sacrificing invertibility. By contrast, the motion-compensated lifting transform remains invertible regardless of the motion model. The previous work was primarily in the context of a block motion model. However, block motion models inevitably yield discontinuous motion fields, which poorly represent complex motion in real video sequences. In this paper we consider the benefits of a continuous motion field, by incorporating a deformable mesh motion model into the existing framework. Experimental results show that this leads to improved compression and visual quality. In addition, we show that the invertibility of continuous motion fields allows greater potential for compactly representing the motion information. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe sparse matrix-vector {{multiplication}} (SpMV) is {{a fundamental}} kernel used in computational science. As a result, {{the performance of a}} large number of applications depends on the efficiency of the SpMV. This kernel is, in fact, a bandwidth- limited operation and poses a challenge for optimization when the matrix has an irregular structure. Over the last few years, a large body of research has been devoted to implementing SpMV on throughput-oriented manycore processors. Several sparse matrix formats have been proposed, with different strengths and weaknesses, as well as other alternative optimization strategies such as row reordering. This paper proposes the design of an architecture-aware technique for improving the performance of the SpMV on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). This optimization is based on a novel heuristic capable of reducing cache memory accesses within hardware-level thread <b>blocks</b> (<b>warps).</b> The technique is designed and implemented using a variation of the sliced ELL sparse format. However, the underlying idea is structure-independent and can be easily adapted to other sparse representations.

40|$|Photogeologic {{and field}} mapping of a 530 mi² area in southeastern Washington and {{southern}} Madison Counties, Arkansas, indicates that post-Atoka structural deformation occurred primarily through differential uplift of basement fault blocks. Northeast and east trending basement faults and fracture systems are present. Northeast trending features {{are related to}} the major fracture systems of the stable continental interior. They were initiated by shearing during Pre-Cambrian time and have subsequently acted as crustal zones of weakness along which mostly vertical movement has occurred. East trending basement faults may have originally developed as a result of tension between the stable Ozark uplift and the subsiding Arkoma basin during late Atokan time. Northeast and east trending faults join to form a mosaic of polygonal basement blocks. During post-Atoka uplift(s) of the Ozark region, each block behaved more or less independently. Normal faults and (more commonly) monoclinal draping occurred in the sedimentary rocks which overlie the marginal basement fault zones. Slight tilting and <b>warping</b> of the <b>blocks</b> created local homoclinal dips whose magnitude and direction may change abruptly at block margins.
