25|$|Sonic 3D Blast was {{the final}} Sonic game to be {{released}} for the Sega Genesis. Sega had discontinued official support for the Genesis in 1995, but intended all along to produce the game for the 16-bit console because games typically sell for {{one to two years}} after their platforms' discontinuation. Early on, a test build was made to help decide if a split-screen two-player mode would be viable, but split-screen would not end up in the final product. Jon Burton, programmer for the Genesis version, implemented an exception handler <b>where,</b> <b>should</b> an error occur, the game would greet the player with a secret level select screen instead of crashing; this was done so the game could easily pass Sega's approval process for publishing games. Burton also gave this version a unique full motion video intro sequence that could only fit on the 4MB cartridge by using compression and various tricks to make the low-resolution video appear higher resolution.|$|E

50|$|The proper {{recitation of}} the Quran {{is the subject}} of a {{separate}} discipline named tajwid which determines in detail how the Quran should be recited, how each individual syllable is to be pronounced, the need to pay attention to the places <b>where</b> there <b>should</b> be a pause, to elisions, <b>where</b> the pronunciation <b>should</b> be long or short, <b>where</b> letters <b>should</b> be sounded together and <b>where</b> they <b>should</b> be kept separate, etc. It may be said that this discipline studies the laws and methods of the proper recitation of the Quran and covers three main areas: the proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels (the articulation of the Quranic phonemes), the rules of pause in recitation and of resumption of recitation, and the musical and melodious features of recitation.|$|R

2500|$|Information {{security}} {{must protect}} information throughout {{the life span}} of the information, from the initial creation of the information on through to the final disposal of the information. [...] The information must be protected while in motion and while at rest. During its lifetime, information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems. There are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened. To fully protect the information during its lifetime, each component of the information processing system must have its own protection mechanisms. The building up, layering on and overlapping of security measures is called defense in depth. In contrast to a metal chain, which is famously only as strong as its weakest link, the defense-in-depth aims at a structure <b>where,</b> <b>should</b> one defensive measure fail, other measures will continue to provide protection.|$|E
2500|$|Black {{would not}} appear again until April at a ChickFight event where {{she made an}} {{emotional}} retirement announcement that was interrupted by Jetta who demanded Black explicitly acknowledge she was the reason Black was retiring but rather than ignore her, Black challenged her to what was dubbed a [...] "Career vs. Humiliation" [...] match at ChickFight XI <b>where,</b> <b>should</b> she lose, Black would have to admit it was Jetta that retired her but if she won Jetta would have to publicly go {{on her knees and}} admit Black's superiority. Jetta made her intentions known by squashing Faith LeHaine early on in the evening, wrenching her shoulder with a Japanese stranglehold and spent most of the match against Black working on her shoulder but Black retaliated, applying the Garden of Eden around the ring post and eventually locking it on Jetta {{in the middle of the}} ring forcing her to tap out. Following the match Black announced that she didn't need Jetta to go on her knees as she had just proven her superiority in the match. She later announced her retirement from wrestling.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{electrification}} systems take AC {{energy from}} a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and {{converted to a}} DC voltage {{to be used by}} traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. <b>Where</b> <b>should</b> this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? [...] And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? [...] Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). [...] Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. [...] Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.|$|E
2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate. To consolidate such {{a large segment of}} moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, {{it can be said that}} healthcare itself is a [...] "special" [...] institution within society. With that said, healthcare ought to [...] "be treated differently from other social goods" [...] in a society. It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? <b>Where</b> <b>should</b> they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E

Yes, there is – that I {{do not have}} her forgiveness; and she is and remains an intermediate court, a legitimate court, that must not be bypassed. Her forgiveness certainly cannot justify me eternally, {{no more than a}} person’s implacability can harm anyone but himself, but her forgiveness is a part of a divine procedure. Why, then, do you not have it? Because I could not make myself understandable to her. ... Suppose she had forgiven me. Then, of course, she would not have forgotten me.

Be it done for you as you believe. But everything in you that is flesh and blood and is timorousness and attachment to things of this earth must despair, so that you cannot acquire external certainty. If this like for like holds true even in relation to what most definitely must be called Gospel, how much more, then, when Christianity is itself the Law. “Forgive, then you will be forgiven" [...] Works of Love, Sep 29, 1847, Hong 378-380 ...|$|E
