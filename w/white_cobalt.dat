50|$|V1 - Introduced in 1999 and {{featured}} a pickguard, top jack, reverse headstock, licensed Floyd Rose tremolo systems and 22 frets. Versions were HH, HSS, and HSH. V1 Stagemasters {{did not come}} from the factory in HHH or SSS versions. Colors made were Black, Polar <b>White,</b> <b>Cobalt</b> Blue Metallic, Galactic Purple and Frost Red. All V1 models were available with a natural wood color headstock or with a matching painted headstock. All came with chrome hardware. Discontinued in 2000. Very early versions had CY98xxxxxx serial numbers but were assembled in early 1999, not in 1998 per Fender Customer Service. V1 bodies & necks are interchangeable with Stratocaster guitars.|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of the MA-XRF imaging results shown in Figs.  3 a, b, the {{background}} blue involves mixtures of cobalt-based, copper-based and chromium-based pigment(s) admixed with lead white and zinc <b>white.</b> <b>Cobalt</b> blue has been positively identified by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in two paint fragments taken from the background (see Additional file 1 : Table S 1). The Co distribution map suggests the presence of this blue pigment mainly in the upper-right background while Ultramarine and Prussian are most prevalent in the upper left. Ultramarine and Prussian blue were also identified, through point Raman spectroscopy analyses (see Additional file 1 : Table S 2). In comparison with the surrounding blue background, the three leaves depicted in the upper left corner of the painting are richer in Co element. Unlike the background surface, Prussian blue appears as the predominant blue pigment used for depicting the dress, although this one incorporates cobalt blue-based areas as well. The chromium distribution overall the dress suggests further yellow and/or green Cr-based pigment(s) for achieving the greenish blue shades. Unfortunately, {{it was not possible to}} determine if the detected pigments are mixed together or if they come from distinct paint layers. Only Prussian blue and Vermilion were successfully identified in the blue and red small brushstrokes depicting the edges of the dress in the red shirt region.|$|E
50|$|On February 19, 1937, a Royal Decree {{issued by}} Queen Wilhelmina finally {{laid down the}} red, white and blue colours as the {{national}} flag (heraldic colours of bright vermilion, <b>white</b> and <b>cobalt</b> blue).|$|R
50|$|In {{the blue}} series {{the absence of}} the yellow pigment turns the body colour to white, {{although}} this is usually suffused with blue, often quite heavily. When the suffusion is light, Dilute Skyblues are known as Whites; when it is heavy they are known as Suffused <b>Whites.</b> Dilute <b>Cobalts</b> and Mauves are usually known as Suffused Whites.|$|R

30|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown the {{improved}} ability to identify artists’ pigments by combining results from X-ray fluorescence (XRF), which provides elemental information, with reflectance spectroscopy in the visible to near infrared (400 – 1000  nm) that provides information on electronic transitions. Extending the spectral range of reflectance spectroscopy into the UV, 350 – 400  nm, allows identification of several white pigments since their electronic transitions occur in this region (e.g., zinc white and rutile and anatase forms of titanium white). Extending the range further into the infrared, out to 2500  nm, provides information on vibrational transitions of various functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carbonate, and methyl groups. This allows better identification of mineral-based pigments and some paint binders. The combination of elemental information with electronic and vibrational transitions provides a more robust method to identify artists’ materials in situ. The collection of both sets of spectral information across works of art, such as paintings and works on paper, allows generating a more complete map of artists’ materials. Here, we describe a 2 -D scanner that simultaneously collects XRF spectra and reflectance spectra from 350 to 2500  nm across the surfaces of works of art. The scanner consists of a stationary, single pixel XRF spectrometer and fiber optic reflectance spectrometer along with a 2 -D position-controlled easel that moves the artwork {{in front of the}} two detection systems. The dual-mode scanner has been tested on a variety of works of art from illuminated manuscripts (0.1 [*]×[*] 0.1  m 2) to paintings as large as 1.7 [*]×[*] 1.9  m 2. The scanner is described and two sets of results are presented. The first is the XRF scanning of a large warped panel painting by Andrea del Sarto titled Charity. The second is a combined XRF and reflectance scan of Georges Seurat’s painting titled Haymakers at Montfermeil. The XRF was collected at 1  mm spatial sampling and the reflectance spectral data at 3  mm. Combining the results from the data sets was found to enhance the identification of pigments as well as yield distribution maps, in spite of the relatively low reflectance spatial sampling. The elemental and reflectance maps allowed the identification and mapping of lead <b>white,</b> <b>cobalt</b> blue, viridian, ochres, and likely chrome yellow. The maps also provide information on the mixing of pigments. While the reflectance image cube has 10 – 20 ×[*]larger spatial samples than desired, the elimination of having to use two hyperspectral cameras to cover the range from 400 to 2500  nm makes for a low cost dual modality scanner.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by the {{architect}} Antonio Palacios, it was inaugurated on 17 October 1919. It {{was one of}} the original eight stations that served Madrid´s first metro line. This was the first such project in Spain, and {{the architect}} was inspired by the look of the Parisian stations of the time. He managed to mitigate the possible reluctance of the public to use the subway, by using bright, colorful materials in the spaces in contact with travelers, such as hallways, tunnels, passage and platform finishes, extensively using tiles and other <b>white</b> and <b>cobalt</b> blue ceramic pieces. Its design met the criteria of functionality, simplicity and economy.|$|R

40|$|Utilizing a radical-nucleophilic {{aromatic}} substitution reaction, a novel bisterpyridine compound {{containing a}} high degree of conjugation was synthesized. This compound was then used along with a series of transition metal compounds to create a series of coordination polymers. The metals used in this series were iron, resulting in a deep purple compound; nickel, resulting in a pale yellow compound; zinc, resulting in a slightly pink, off <b>white</b> compound; <b>cobalt,</b> resulting in a vibrant turquoise compound; copper, resulting in a dark pastel green compound; and ruthenium, resulting in a dark red compound. The iron coordination polymer was characterized using NMR spectroscopy, and was estimated to possess a molecular weight just under 40, 000 g/mol using viscometric analysis. Conductivity measurements were performed on the iron polymer, the results of which unfortunately showed no conductivity. The thermal properties of the iron coordination polymer were also examined, and using TGA it was found to undergo two major decompositions at approximately 460 °C and 485 °C losing 11. 27 % and 55. 04 % mass respectively. It was also observed to undergo a glass transition at - 37. 86 °C. The full polymer series was examined using NMR spectroscopy, and several of the compounds were also examined using EPR spectroscopy. Several of the polymers were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy, and the zinc polymer displayed an unexpected fluorescence enhancement of nearly five times over the uncoordinated monomer. Quantum yield experiments determined that this polymer has a quantum yield of 0. 33 %...|$|R

50|$|Drawn by the großer Berggeschrey (“Great Call of the Mountains”) to the Ore Mountains in the 16th century (silver, tin, <b>cobalt,</b> <b>white</b> {{earth and}} gravel mining), many {{settlers}} came {{here from the}} Harz Mountains and found a new home. Bockau received status as a mining area, comparable to status as a mining town, although Bockau was not actually considered a town. Specialists and academics, too, settled here. In 1750, Gottlieb Lorenz introduced vitriolic acid distilling into Bockau. From gravelly ores mined in the area, such as pyrite, which yield sulphur salts (vitriol) came, after weeks of heating and “cooking” in stone vats, concentrated sulphuric acid, also called vitriolic acid. This was put to use in medicine and was an important raw material for both inorganic and organic chemistry. About 1760 there were already 7 vitriol plants in town, and by 1812 there were 24 distilleries in operation. Important sidelines for the farmers were tree felling, charcoal making, resin harvesting (this was limited by decree to a patch of the woods known as the Harzweide, or “resin meadow”, to prevent widespread damage to the forest https://web.archive.org/web/20081120185657/http://www.beerheide.net/home/geschichte.htmhttp://www.wanderer-familie.de/html/genealogie.html) and log driving.|$|R
5000|$|West {{from these}} beaches is Playa Carrizalillo which has <b>white</b> sand and <b>cobalt</b> blue water edged in light green. This 300 m beach is {{on a small}} bay. There are no {{vehicular}} roads to this beach, and the footpath descends a steep slope on a recently installed rock stairway. It takes about fifteen minutes to walk to here from the town. A water taxi ride from Playa Principal is another option for accessing Carrizalillo. [...] Waves are normally gentle, except for a zone that opens directly onto the ocean where waves are big enough for surfing. The difficult access means that the beach is not as crowded with walking vendors as the Puerto Angelito Beach. There are few restaurants and the area is generally cleaner. On {{the east and west}} sides of the bay are rocky outcroppings that serve as habitat {{for a wide variety of}} fish and coral, making it popular for snorkeling. Near Carrizalillo is the Rinconada, a former landing strip that is now lined with restaurants, salons, and shops. It also contains a lending library run by a local charity run by expatriates.|$|R
