40|$|Research has {{identified}} three personality subtypes in adults <b>with</b> eating disorders (<b>EDs)</b> : a high-functioning, an undercontrolled, and an overcontrolled group. The current study investigated whether similar personality prototypes exist in adolescents <b>with</b> <b>EDs,</b> and whether these personality prototypes show relationships to external correlates indicative of diagnostic validity. Methods: Experienced clinicians from an adolescent practice-research network provided data on ED symptoms, DSM-IV comorbidity, personality pathology, {{and family and}} developmental history for 120 adolescent patients <b>with</b> <b>EDs.</b> Results: Consistent <b>with</b> {{the findings from the}} adult literature, three types of personality pathology emerged in adolescents: High functioning/Perfectionistic, Emotionally Dysregulated, and Avoidant/Depressed. The High-functioning prototype showed negative associations with comorbidity and positive associations with treatment response. The Emotionally Dysregulated prototype was specifically associated with externalizing Axis I and Cluster B Axis II disorders, poor school functioning, and adverse events in childhood. The Avoidant/Depressed prototype showed specific associations with internalizing Axis I and Clusters A Axis II disorders, poor peer relationships, poor maternal relationships, and internalizing disorders in first-degree relatives. Conclusions: These data support the presence of at least three diagnostically meaningful personality prototypes in adolescents <b>with</b> <b>EDs,</b> similar to those found previously in adults.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives Heightened {{sensitivity}} to social comparison and negative self-evaluation have {{been implicated in}} the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs). This study used behavioral tasks, as well as self-report measures, to examine processing of social rank-related cues and implicit self-concept in participants <b>with</b> <b>EDs.</b> Method Fifty healthy participants (HCs), 46 people <b>with</b> an <b>ED,</b> and 22 people recovered from an ED (REC) undertook an attentional bias task using social rank-related cues and an implicit self-evaluation task. In addition, they completed self-report measures of social comparison, submissive behavior, and shame. Results People <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> showed vigilance toward social rank-related stimuli and lower implicit positive self-evaluation than HCs. Self-report data confirmed the behavioral findings and showed that people <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> had higher levels of unfavorable social comparison, submissive behaviors, and external and internal shame than HCs. People who had recovered from an ED showed an intermediate profile between the two groups. Discussion People <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> have heightened {{sensitivity to}} social rank-related cues and impaired self-evaluation at an automatic level of processing. Some of these biases remain in people who have recovered. Interventions which aim to remediate social threat sensitivity and negative bias about self and others might be of benefit in EDs. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Constraint and impulsivity are not isolated to the domain of eating in women <b>with</b> <b>EDs.</b> Personality provides a link between eating and sexuality in at least a subset of women <b>with</b> <b>EDs.</b> A large body of clinical and empirical literature generated over the last 30 years has linked eating disorders (EDs) and sexuality (see Wiederman, 1996, for a recent review).

40|$|Stroke {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of eating {{difficulties}} (EDs). It {{is one of the}} leading causes of death and disability and one of the most important factors contributing to health-care costs. There is a clear association between EDs after stroke and undernutrition, where studies have shown that structured screening of eating function among stroke patients can predict nutritional problems as well as need for subsequent institutional care. Reliable and valid instruments that can identify EDs exist, but there is lack of knowledge on how persons experience living <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> after stroke. Stroke unit care is evidence-based and grounded in multidisciplinary collaboration and continuity of care. The overall aim of this thesis is to explore and describe EDs after stroke as represented by health care professionals in patient records (PRs) and transferred information, and as described by persons living <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> after stroke. An additional aim is to explore methodological aspects related to the inclusion of persons <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> and communication impairment in research studies. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Two studies used descriptive designs (I, II), one an explorative design (III) and one applied a methodological discussion (IV). In one of the studies PR data were used (I), in another study data were derived from three sources: PRs, screening of patients and interviews with nurses (II). Persons <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> after stroke participated in Study III while literature, empirical data and researchers' experiences served as the data in study IV. Data were analysed by categorisation of phrases (I), content analysis (II) and descriptive statistics (I, II), by qualitative analysis (III) and by processing of literature and empirical findings in two research groups (IV). The main findings from the studies on representation of stroke care in PRs (I, II) showed that, despite that > 50 % of patients in Study I and all patients in Study II had EDs, there were few signs of multidisciplinary collaboration dealing with this problem. Unsystematic screening for swallowing difficulties was routine, whereas screening for nutritional risk and EDs was lacking (I, II). Multidisciplinary discharge summaries proved to have low quality and entailed little information on patients' eating ability (I). The two EDs most frequently documented were swallowing and lack of energy to complete a meal (I,II). EDs were described in vague terms (I, II). In Study II, all patients had swallowing difficulties and most patients had lack of energy to complete a meal. The electronic information transfer tool held information on eating ability for most patients (II), but the nursing staff in residential home care perceived deficiencies in that information, even identifying several EDs not reported at discharge (II). Experiences from persons living <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> after stroke were presented in one main theme: Striving to live a normal life, including three sub-themes: Abandoned to learn on one's own (little support from health care professionals to learn to handle eating), Experiencing losses (loss of eating functions and loss of valued activities) and Feeling dependent in mealtime situations (III). One major finding from the methodological exploration (IV) is that creative approaches and suitable methods for inclusion of participants <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> and communication impairment into qualitative studies can be found in the fields of aphasiology and learning disabilities. Another major finding from Study IV is that researchers need good communication skills as well as knowledge in neuropsychology. A general conclusion is that screening for EDs should be routine in stroke care and that a multidisciplinary terminology to express EDs must be developed to provide accurate information transfer. Health care professionals need to enhance their knowledge in nutrition and provide support to stroke patients <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> <b>with</b> the goal that they can eat and perform meal-related activities in accordance with their habits before the stroke. To gain access to the experiences of persons <b>with</b> <b>EDs</b> and communication impairment researchers need to test participatory approaches when planning for inclusion of those persons...|$|R
