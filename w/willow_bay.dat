2500|$|On April 20, 1999, CNN was {{covering}} Clinton's speech in Littleton, Colorado, following the Columbine High School massacre. Dobbs ordered the producer {{to cut away}} from the speech and return to broadcast Moneyline. Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN {{to return to the}} speech. Kaplan later said, [...] "Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it". Dobbs announced on the air that [...] "CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton". A few days later, Dobbs announced that he was leaving the network to start Space.com, a website devoted to astronautical news.

50|$|In late summer, {{phytoplankton}} {{stock is}} dominated by green algae paired equal levels of diatoms, cyanobacteria, and a species of eutroph carapace flagellate (Ceratium hirundinella). Several of the blue green algae present in the lake are potentially poisonous and, notwithstanding non-alarming levels, therefore carefully monitored near the bathe. Lacking soft and shallow bottom areas near the shore, the lake contains only commonplace vegetation, save for the population of crack willow and the hybrid between white <b>willow</b> and <b>bay</b> <b>willow</b> found on the southern shore. Aquatic plants are dominated by white waterlily, amphibious bistort, and occasional curled pondweed (uncommon to Stockholm).|$|R

40|$|Native {{woodlands}} are characterised by {{a canopy}} of locally native trees and shrubs. They provide habitat for {{a large proportion of}} our native wildlife species including many targeted by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Woodlands in the Western Isles are generally dominated by downy birch, eared and grey willow, and rowan, with small stands of aspen found on mineral soils. Two native species: hazel and juniper (also found outwith woodlands) have a particularly limited and fragmented distribution, and may {{be on the verge of}} extinction. A number of other Scottish native species, including ash, blackthorn, bird cherry and <b>bay</b> <b>willow,</b> have been recorded, though their status as locally native is questionable. There are historical records of alder and oak, but they are currently not known outside plantations. UK Biodiversity Status...|$|R

5000|$|The birding trails along Grand Isle {{consists}} of nearly sixty acres of marsh and chenier habitat and are divided up into six tracts that are {{managed by the}} Louisiana Nature Conservancy and the Grand Isle Community Development Team. [...] The trails mainly consist of tracts procured by the Grand Isle Nature Conservancy or donated by local landowners. However, {{because some of the}} boundaries of the tracts are partially fragmented, the chenier habitat can sometimes expand into private property. But due to the increased popularity of the Migratory Bird Festival, private landowners will generally allow bird watchers and ornithologists permission onto their land. Some residents will go as far as to post signs that say [...] "Bird Friendly" [...] as a way to invite bird watchers onto their property. The Grilleta Tract was established by a donation of ten acres by the Xavier Grilleta of B&G Services in 1998. [...] In 2001, an additional three acres were acquired that were adjacent to the original property. Although slightly smaller than the Port Commission Marsh, the Grilleta Tract is mostly chenier habitat and is considered the center of the Grand Isle Birding Trail. This stand of forest is one of only two undisturbed chenier forests that still exist on the island. In addition to live oaks, in which a select few are over 125 years old, the area supports a variety of trees and shrubs such as red mulberry, black <b>willow,</b> red <b>bay.</b>|$|R
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the <b>bay</b> <b>willow</b> (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|R
