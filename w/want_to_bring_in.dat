5|$|Financial {{difficulties}} and instability at board level led to six managerial changes in seven years. Saunders resigned after FA Cup defeat to non-league Altrincham, John Bond {{seemed out of}} touch, and in April 1989, once relegation to the Third Division {{for the first time}} in the club's history was confirmed, the club's new owners replaced Garry Pendrey with Dave Mackay. Within 18 months, with relegation to the Fourth Division a possibility, Mackay resigned. Lou Macari came in, revitalised the side, won the Associate Members' Cup at Wembley, and three weeks later walked out to join Stoke City. Terry Cooper won promotion back to the second tier and kept the team going during four months of administration before he quit, fearing new owner David Sullivan would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> his own man.|$|E
500|$|Meat Loaf had {{announced}} that Michael Beinhorn was producing the record, but Desmond Child took the helm. The singer reports that Child would {{say things that}} made him think he {{was sitting next to}} Steinman. Child began recording sessions by playing Slipknot CDs to get the assembled musicians in the mood. In addition to musicians from his touring band, the Neverland Express, several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, [...] "I didn't just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people" [...] resulting in an album that [...] "has all the touches of the other two Bats, but it's much more of a rock album." [...] Child says {{that one of the most}} memorable experiences working on the album was working with Brian May, who played on [...] "Bad for Good". The album also featured guest performances by John 5, Steve Vai and John Shanks.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{listening}} to the finished tracks, the members selected guest appearances they felt would work with the songs.

Or let's get Jay-Z on there." [...] Wentz commented on working with Jay-Z, saying [...] "It was insane. We called him up and thought we were gonna talk to his assistant. Then he answers the phone, like, 'Yo, this is Hov,' and we were like, 'Um ...' It just happened like that. And it was pretty crazy." [...] Jay-Z recorded his introduction to the album's opening song [...] "Thriller" [...] while on tour in Australia {{and sent it to}} the band, who later put the vocal on the album. At a fashion show in Los Angeles, Wentz met rapper Kanye West, who invited Wentz and Stump to his home to share new music. West then agreed to create a remix of [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] three weeks before the scheduled release of the album. The band was unable to include the remix on the album due to time constraints, but a remix of West's version featuring Lil Wayne, Lupe Fiasco, Travis McCoy, Paul Wall and Tyga was released in July 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Since 2006 he has commentated less frequently, {{missing the}} 2007 World Cup, despite having covered {{the opening ceremonies}} of the two {{preceding}} World Cups in 2003 and 1999 for TMS. Speaking to Michael Parkinson about this on BBC Radio 2 on 26 August 2007, he responded {{to the question of}} why he was commentating less these days, by remarking that [...] "they obviously <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> new faces" [...] adding that during the Ashes series during 2006–7 [...] "I felt in a funny way that I wasn't part of it any more". During the summer 2008 season, he resumed a full commentating quota on Tests and ODIs.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{this gentleman}} had {{a younger brother}} of still better {{appearance}} than himself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad, and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored there; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored everywhere. To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one day, 'Jem, there's a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and they want men. I wonder you don't go in for statistics.' Jem, rather taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to 'go in' for statistics as for anything else. So, he went in. He coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows, and said, 'If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in,</b> for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech, look after my brother Jem, for he's your man.' After a few dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to become known there and in the neighbourhood. Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand; superscribed, 'Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown. Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire. Thomas Gradgrind.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Sasha Alexander's {{character}} Caitlin [...] "Kate" [...] Todd {{was killed}} {{off in the}} second season finale following Alexander's decision to permanently exit the role, and shortly afterwards Bellisario announced plans to replace her with another female lead, originally described as [...] "a European or Australian girl who is very comfortable with her femininity and sexuality." [...] He later elaborated, [...] "The last thing I {{want to do is}} go back to the same character...I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> (a new character) who is working for Interpol or the Royal Australian Navy, someone foreign who brings a whole new attitude. Kate was kind of uptight, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> somebody who doesn't live by the three-button rule for women in business." ...|$|E
50|$|Two {{days after}} Bolton Wanderers secured their premiership status he was axed by Megson with six {{other members of}} the {{coaching}} staff at the club.

50|$|Gene Simmons {{originally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> Omarosa only.
