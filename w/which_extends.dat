5|$|As {{a result}} of the change in maintenance, NY360 became part of four {{unsigned}} county routes. On Morton Road, NY360 was co-designated as County Route279 (CR279). The portion on Redman Road was part of CR236, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> from NY31 west of Brockport to Cook Road near the Lake Ontario State Parkway. The section of NY360 on Church Road overlapped with CR277. Finally, the part of NY360 on Lake Road West Fork was concurrent with CR234, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> north past NY360 to Moscow Road (CR211). All four overlaps were eliminated when the NY360 designation was officially removed in February 2012, and the NY 360 shields were removed by June of that year.|$|E

5|$|Sarawak can {{be divided}} into two {{geological}} zones: the Sunda Shield, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> southwest from the Batang Lupar River (near Sri Aman) and forms the southern tip of Sarawak, and the geosyncline region, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> northeast to the Batang Lupar River, forming the central and northern regions of Sarawak. The oldest rock type in southern Sarawak is schist formed during the Carboniferous and Lower Permian times, while the youngest igneous rock in this region, andesite, can be found at Sematan. Geological formation of the central and northern regions started during the late Cretaceous period. Other types of stone that can be found in central and northern Sarawak are shale, sandstone, and chert.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{island is}} Lewis and Harris <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> to 2,179square kilometres, {{and there are}} a further 200 islands which are greater than 40hectares in area. Of the remainder, several such as Staffa and the Flannan Isles are well known despite their small size.|$|E
5|$|All Silkies {{have black}} or bluish skin, bones and grayish-black meat; their Chinese {{language}} name is wu gu ji (烏骨雞), meaning 'black-boned chicken'. Melanism <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> beyond the skin into an animal's connective tissue {{is a rare}} trait, and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis, which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia. The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation. Disregarding color, the breed does not generally produce {{as much as the}} more common meat breeds of chicken.|$|E

5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> {{through the}} {{countries}} of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina and includes six or more Quaternary caldera or ignimbrite systems, about 44 stratovolcanoes, and over 18 smaller centres. One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest volcano. This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such volcano to the south is Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° southern latitude.|$|E

This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> from the Alaska–Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the larger}} Death Valley springs derive their water from a {{regional}} aquifer, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> as far east as southern Nevada and Utah. Much {{of the water in}} this aquifer has been there for many thousands of years, since the Pleistocene ice ages, when the climate was cooler and wetter. Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{additional}} Dinocephalosaurus specimens {{were discovered}} from the slightly older Luoping locality, {{which has been}} dated to 245–244 million years old based on conodont biostratigraphy as well as preliminary radiometric dating. The specimens originate from bed 74 of the Luoping locality, in deposits located {{near the village of}} Dawazi, Luoping County, Yunnan, China. Bed 74 is part of a section composed of thin dark grey micritic limestone layers mixed with thicker layers of siliceous limestone and silty limestone, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> downwards to bed 67.|$|E

5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E

5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels <b>which</b> <b>extends</b> upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole.|$|E
