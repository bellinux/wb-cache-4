500|$|Jaws 2 {{was briefly}} the highest-grossing sequel in history until Rocky II was {{released}} in 1979. The film's tagline, [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was safe to}} go back in the water...," [...] {{has become one of the}} most famous in film history and has been parodied and homaged several times. Jaws 2 is generally considered to be the best of the three Jaws sequels.|$|E
500|$|The film's tagline, [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it {{was safe}} to go back in the water...", {{has become one of the}} most famous in film history. Andrew J. Kuehn, who {{developed}} the first film's trailer, is credited with coining the phrase. It has been parodied in numerous films; most notably the tagline of the 1996 feature film adaptation of the television series, Flipper, [...] "This summer it's finally safe to go back in the water." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Do You..." [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said the song [...] "spins the ostensibly sleazy pickup line 'Do you like drugs?' into an irresistibly sweet proposal, imagining lovely, perfectly wasted afternoons {{spent in a}} content daze." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly called it a [...] "fabulous song" [...] and felt that [...] "Miguel's smooth, subtle swagger is so appealing that a line like 'I wanna do you like drugs tonight' comes off as audacious instead of offensive." [...] Rob Tannenbaum of Rolling Stone quipped, [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> there were no new ways to say 'I love you'".|$|E

500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{described}} the video as a moving inspiration {{to a child}} suffering from grief. The Huffington Post wrote {{that if they were}} able to engage in time travel themselves, they would be unable to encounter a kinder tale. Io9 appreciated that Capaldi was using his celebrity status to effect positive change through his portrayal of the character, and praised his use of the fictional role as a force for public good. The South Wales Evening Post noted that Capaldi had appeared in a brief video as himself congratulating a bride on her wedding, and wrote that this video was more impressive than the previous appearance. Metro commented [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> Peter Capaldi couldn't possibly get any cooler, he's gone and outdone himself with this video." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} universal acclaim from contemporary music critics. Lindsey Weber of Vulture called the short film a [...] "strangely moving ode to Los Angeles". Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A+ and wrote, [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that Jared Leto and Thirty Seconds to Mars cannot possible [...] get any better, they prove us wrong" [...] with their music video for [...] "City of Angels". He found it [...] "raw and captivating" [...] {{and felt that}} [...] "it will certainly move people." [...] Brenna Ehrlich from MTV commented that while the short film [...] "may lack all the majestic animals" [...] featured in the music video for [...] "Up in the Air", [...] "it does have some exotic animals of a different sort: a whole pack of celebrities." [...] Liza Darwin from Nylon magazine opened her review by writing, [...] "There are music videos, {{and then there are}} Thirty Seconds to Mars music videos." [...] She stated, [...] "Part documentary, part cinematic music video, this Jared Leto-helmed mini-film is touching, sweet, and totally worth watching in its 11-minute entirety." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} hand it to EastEnders. Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Fight Club" [...] {{was largely}} negative. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "D–"; {{he called it}} [...] "dire stuff" [...] and wrote that [...] "there’s something rancid about forced quirk; it’s rotten and smug". Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script. He also felt that the [...] "relentless self-awareness isn’t amusing anymore". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote [...] "If it is indeed true that somewhere out in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. I sincerely hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me." [...] Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> The X-Files couldn't get a more grating guest star than Victoria Jackson, Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, {{for the love of}} God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.' It's a safe bet this disjointed, lame episode will probably not be easily confused with the far superior David Fincher movie of the same name. But then the current state of The X-Files makes Elmo in Grouchland look like an Oscar contender." ...|$|E
500|$|Corey Taylor {{explained}} that the phrase [...] "All Hope Is Gone" [...] is aimed at the fans' expectations of the band, further elaborating, [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> you had us figured out, give up all hope because you're never, ever going to." [...] Throughout the album, Taylor incorporates a focus on politics in his lyrics, compared to Slipknot's previous albums. The opening track, [...] ".execute.", features Taylor's response to former United States Vice President Spiro Agnew's speech targeted at Vietnam War protesters. and the second track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] follows in the same vein. During an interview with Kerrang!, Taylor discussed the song's lyrical content, explaining, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} people who are disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy. And that hurts me." [...] Reviewing for IGN, Jim Kaz said that lyrically, [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] gives the listener a [...] "heaping dose of Corey Taylor's caustic bravado". On the track [...] "Wherein Lies Continue", Taylor offers a [...] "dressing down of the world as we know it", explaining, [...] "It kinda goes up against any civilization that takes themselves way too seriously and where the 'leaders' are so pretentious that they think they are deemed to speak for the people." [...] He also proclaimed, [...] "It wouldn't be a Slipknot album if I didn't rag on the recording industry." [...] On [...] "Butcher's Hook", Taylor specifically targets [...] "all those little emo boys", commenting, [...] "People give us shit for wearing outfits, but all of those guys look exactly the same." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror {{described}} {{the program as}} [...] "far too funny". A review in The Daily Mirror was positive, commenting, [...] "If {{you want to see}} a brilliant spoof about Tom Cruise's faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes, look no further than C4's Star Stories." [...] She commented, [...] "It's so absurd, even Tom will laugh." [...] The Advertiser described Star Stories as [...] "a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups", and noted of the episode's title, [...] "This week's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise [...] - How Scientology isn't in Any Way Mental, which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined." [...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel." [...] Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their [...] "Critics' Choice" [...] column. They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program [...] "a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival".|$|E

2500|$|On March 27, 2006, D'Or {{released}} Kmo HaRuach ("Like the Wind"), {{which included}} duets with Israeli singers Arkadi Duchin, Arik Einstein, Shlomi Shabat, and Ehud Banai, {{and the song}} [...] "Zman Ahava" [...] ("Time for Love") with Ehud Banai. D'Or composed all the songs on the album, combining world music with jazz, Thai, and Indian elements. In 2006, D'Or also collaborated with rapper Subliminal for the song [...] "Ten Koah" [...] ("Give Me Strength") on Subliminal's hip hop album, Just <b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Thought</b> it Was Over.

2500|$|Ben Travers of IndieWire {{gave the}} episode an A- rating, stating [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> Fargo was playing it safe in Season 3, in comes a big swing. Episode 3 {{had a lot}} of {{originality}} to it, breaking the pattern set by Seasons 1 and 2 while elevating one character to telling heights. In other words, arguments that Hawley was ready to recede into formula were put to rest, and those of us already enthralled with Year Three were again reminded of Gloria’s distinct relationship to her policeman predecessors. Just as importantly, it threw an early curveball for everyone, knocking us off our game and reminding us how creative this anthology can be." [...] He also praised how the episode showed both the good and bad sides of technology. Noel Murray of Rolling Stone called the episode [...] "a wondrous, moody hour of television, bordering on despairing, with only a little of the comedic quirkiness that is this drama's stock-in-trade. It's the rare prestige TV episode that might've been even better if it had run even longer". He highly praised the story of Unit MNSKY.|$|E
