40|$|A wakefield {{accelerator}} uses {{a medium}} capable of sustaining appropriate electric fields to {{transfer energy from}} a <b>drive</b> <b>beam</b> to a witness beam. Examples of such systems include electron <b>beam</b> <b>driven</b> plasma wakefields, laser driven plasma wakefields and electron <b>beam</b> <b>driven</b> dielectric wakefield structures. Dielectrics and plasmas are of particular interest because {{they are capable of}} maintaining electric fields on the order of GV/m {{and in the case of}} plasmas upwards of TV/m. These systems provide a significant step beyond current radiofrequency accelerating structures capable of peak electric fields on the order of 100 MV/m and average effective electric fields of 20 MV/m. Furthermore, <b>beam</b> <b>driven</b> dielectric structures produce a wakefield which is phase synchronous with the beam, these structures do not suffer from transit time or dephasing effects. In the case of dielectric wakefield accelerators, the structures under study in this publication, the modes generated by the driving beam are in the terahertz (THz) regime. Thus development of dielectric wakefield accelerators is seen as a path to smaller, more compact accelerating systems and as a means to generate THz radiation. Here we demonstrate a beam-driven dielectric wakefield accelerating structure that produces sustained fields of 1. 35 GV/m for many hundreds of thousands of <b>drive</b> <b>beam</b> pulses. In addition we show beam-driven dielectric structures have the potential to produce single mode, high spectral purity THZ radiation of unprecedented energy scale...|$|R

40|$|Conventional field-reversed {{configurations}} (FRC) face notable {{stability and}} confinement concerns, {{which can be}} ameliorated by introducing and maintaining a significant fast ion population in the system. This is the conjecture first introduced by Norman Rostoker multiple decades ago and adopted as the central design tenet in Tri Alpha Energy's advanced <b>beam</b> <b>driven</b> FRC concept. In fact, studying the physics of such neutral <b>beam</b> (NB) <b>driven</b> FRCs over the past decade, considerable improvements were made in confinement and stability. Next to NB injection, the addition of axially streaming plasma guns, magnetic end plugs, as well as advanced surface conditioning lead to dramatic reductions in turbulence driven losses and greatly improved stability. In turn, fast ion confinement improved significantly and allowed for the build-up of a dominant fast particle population. This recently led to the breakthrough of sustaining an advanced <b>beam</b> <b>driven</b> FRC, thereby demonstrating successful maintenance of trapped magnetic flux, plasma dimensions and total pressure inventory for times much longer than all characteristic system time scales and only limited by hardware and electric supply constraints...|$|R
40|$|The CLIC study aims at {{the design}} of a high-energy (0. 5 - 5 TeV), high {{luminosity}} e+e- linear collider, as a possible facility for the post-LHC era. The beams are accelerated using high-frequency (30 GHz) normal-conducting structures operating at high accelerating gradients to reduce the length and, in consequence, the cost of the linac. The RF power for these structures is generated using the so-called Two-Beam Acceleration (TBA) scheme, where a low-energy, high-intensity electron <b>beam</b> (<b>drive</b> <b>beam)</b> runs parallel to the main linacs and is decelerated in resonant structures, which extract RF power from the <b>drive</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>beam</b> is first accelerated in a low-frequency fully-loaded normal-conducting linac.

40|$|<b>Beam</b> <b>driven</b> {{ionisation}} injection is characterised for {{a variety}} of high-Z dopant. We discuss the region of extraction and why the position where electrons are captured influences the final quality of the internally-injected bunch. The <b>beam</b> <b>driven</b> ionisation injection relies on the capability to produce a high gradient fields at the bubble closure, with magnitudes high enough to ionise by tunnelling effect the still bounded electrons (of a high-Z dopant). The ionised electrons are captured by the nonlinear plasma wave at the accelerating and focusing wake phase leading to high-brightness trailing bunches. The high transformer ratio guarantees that the ionisation only occurs at the bubble closure. The quality of the ionisation-injected trailing bunches strongly and non-linearly depends on the properties of the dopant gas (density and initial ionisation state). We use the full 3 D PIC code ALaDyn to consider the highly three-dimensional nature of the effect.
