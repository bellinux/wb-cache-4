During antagonistic behavior, individuals maintain spacing with wrists/thumbs sparring, bites, and loud vocalizations. When moving to a suitable resting place after landing, an individual may fight with conspecifics along the way. A roosting flying fox is positioned upside down with its wings wrapped up. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> too warm, a flying fox fans itself with its wings.

The risk of UTI, likely the most common complication in the long term, is heightened by use of indwelling urinary catheters.

[...] Rolling Stones David Fricke, reviewing Doolittle, said [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was [...] "a corrosive, compelling meditation on God and garbage." [...] The critical success of [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was also reflected commercially; the song reached number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, marking the Pixies' debut in the American charts.

Series producers claimed post-production work was necessary on the show because of the number of microphones used during filming: [...] "The judges make their decisions at the auditions stage based on what they hear on the day, live in the arena. The footage and sound is then edited and dubbed into a finished programme, to deliver the most entertaining experience possible for viewers. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> to the live shows, it will be all live." [...] It was reported on 26 August that Cowell had ordered a ban on pitch correction in future episodes, asking for them to be re-edited. In October 2010, Ofcom ruled that viewers had not been [...] "materially misled" [...] as pitch correction was only used during auditions and not when viewers were paying to vote for the contestants.|$|E

It's slow, moody, ponderous, a little bit boring at times, but <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> to that bit, it's ... the good bit." [...] He also called the song a [...] "grower" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review saying, [...] "'Missing You' is a post-break-up song with a modishly rave-tinged production... {{and after a few}} spins the chorus wiggles into your brain like a tapeworm that missed the turning marked 'digestive tract' ...

500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number.

She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to add that the song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme for the umpteenth time without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots."

[...] Haque also stated, that he was [...] "amused by Peter's static shocking escapade" [...] and [...] "liked the restaurant themed story angle," [...] saying that it was well executed.

Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew.
