This <b>warehousing</b> <b>service</b> would receive excess consumable material that had possible future demand, and hold that material until demand on that item was realized. Annually, CARP processes approximately 70, 000 excess offload transactions from aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, and naval air stations. Of the three, aircraft carriers are the largest customer of this service. This MBA project employs exploratory research to empirically analyze material that is offloaded from aircraft carriers to CARP, and to identify drivers of the high volume of excess consumable material that is generated on-board aircraft carrier inventories. This project proposes policy-level changes to both the allowancing and offload processes for aircraft carriers, and, through statistical modeling and analysis, estimates the outcomes of these changes on inventories and costs.
