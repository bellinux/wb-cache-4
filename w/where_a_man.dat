5|$|However, in Scotland {{and parts}} of {{northern}} England near the Scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century. James VI of Scotland and Robert Kirk discussed elves seriously; elf-beliefs are prominently attested in the Scottish witchcraft trials, particularly the trial of Issobel Gowdie; and related stories also appear in folktales, There is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves, such as Thomas the Rhymer, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> meets a female elf; Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which an Elf-Knight rapes, seduces, or abducts a woman; and The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E

Modell calls the prison and talks to Mulder, who refuses to listen. The call is traced to a sports shop in Occoquan, Virginia where a Carbo-Bar wrapper is left on the counter. Later, Modell is holding {{a picture of a}} young woman in a house <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> is covered in Cerulean Blue paint.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton {{stated that}} the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In {{the middle of that}} century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a letter in the journal English Dance and Song in which she noted that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named John Williams had kept the custom alive for the past sixty years. Blake also explained that she believed that the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire.|$|E

5|$|By custom {{there were}} seven {{conditions}} <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> could divorce his wife. These were: (1) disobedience to parents-in-law, (2) barrenness (unable to continue family line), (3) adultery (mixing another clan's blood into the family), (4) jealousy (of concubines), (5) incurable disease (unable to continue family line), (6) loquacity (not getting along with brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law), and (7) theft. However, a husband {{was not allowed to}} divorce his wife if she had completed three years of mourning for one of his deceased parents, if there were no living relatives in her father's family to return to, or if the husband's family was originally poor but became rich after marriage. Sometimes women were also able to initiate the divorce and remarry if the husband's family was in poverty, he was diseased, or his in-laws were too abusive. Although remarriage was frowned upon (especially since divorce meant a wife took away her dowry wealth from her ex-husband's family), it was nonetheless common amongst divorcees and widowers in all social groups.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood begins {{during an}} ancient Aztec ritual, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> splatters a sacrifice's blood onto the stone mask he wears. It shoots hooks into his skull, {{and he says}} that he has become immortal. In England in 1880, a boy named Dio Brando is adopted by the wealthy Joestar family {{following}} Dio's father Dario's death; this was done as thanks under the mistaken belief that Dario had saved George Joestar and his newborn son Jonathan during a stagecoach accident twelve years prior, when Dario had in reality only been attempting to loot corpses. Intending to inherit the Joestar fortune, Dio presents himself to George as a gentleman, while also bullying Jonathan, using violence, incinerating Jonathan's dog Danny, and forcefully kissing Erina Pendleton, Jonathan's girlfriend. During a fight between Jonathan and Dio, some blood touches the stone mask – now owned by George – leading Dio to learn how it works.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E

5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a military man, they felt he had the quality they were looking for in the role. For the sequence <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E

25|$|This {{language}} flourished {{during the}} 13th and 14th centuries {{as a language}} of culture, developing a rich lyric tradition of which some 2000 compositions (cantigas, meaning 'songs') have been preserved—a few hundred even with their musical score—in a series of collections, and belonging to four main genres: Love songs <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> sings for his love, Cantiga de amigo where a woman sings for her boyfriend, crude, taunting and sexual Songs of Scorn, and religious songs.|$|E

25|$|A {{marriage}} of pleasure, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> pays a {{sum of money}} to a woman or her family {{in exchange for a}} temporary spousal relationship, is found and considered legal among Shia sect of Islam, for example in Iran after 1979. Temporary marriages are forbidden among Sunni sect of Islam. Among Shia, the number of temporary marriages can be unlimited, for a duration that is less than an hour to few months, recognized with an official temporary marriage certificate, and divorce is unnecessary because the temporary marriage automatically expires on the date and time specified on the certificate. Payment to the woman by the man is mandatory, in every temporary marriage and considered as mahr. Its practitioners cite sharia law as permitting the practise. Women's rights groups have condemned it as a form of legalized prostitution.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 {{the station}} manager, Mr T. Cahill and his stockmen were {{attacked}} by Aborigines {{while they were in}} camp while out mustering.

The party made to defend themselves and the attackers scattered. Later the same year the homestead was burned to the ground also blamed on Aborigines who had been pretty troublesome on the station lately. The first person to cycle around Australia, Arthur Charles Jeston Richardson, was to stop at the station during his ride to find the burnt out building, he later came across the mustering party to give them the bad news.|$|E
25|$|Despite rumors to the contrary, {{the brown}} recluse spider has not {{established}} itself in California or anywhere outside its native range. This directly contradicts numerous sensationalized media reports of bites occurring where these spiders are absent (and no specimens were found), {{such as a}} 2014 report from Thailand, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> was claimed to have died from a brown recluse bite. Over the last century, occasional spiders have been intercepted in various locations where they have no known established populations; these spiders may be transported fairly easily, though the lack of established populations well outside the natural range also indicates that such movement has not led to colonization of new areas, after decades of opportunities. Note that the occurrence of brown recluses in a single building (such as a warehouse) outside of the native range is not considered a successful colonization; such single-building populations can occur (e.g., in several such cases in Florida), but do not spread, and can be easily eradicated.|$|E
