Pentangle embarked on a demanding schedule of touring the world and recording and, during this period, Jansch largely gave up solo performances. He did, however, continue to record, releasing Rosemary Lane in 1971. The tracks for this album were recorded on a portable tape recorder by Bill Leader at Jansch's cottage in Ticehurst, Sussex—a process which took several months, with Jansch only working when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> mood.|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do. I just didn’t think he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> physical shape and mental shape.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Mail {{newspaper}} recruited Lady Sarah {{after one}} of its correspondents, Ralph Hellawell, was arrested by the Boers {{as he tried to}} get out of the besieged town of Mafeking to send his dispatch. She <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at the right time to step into the journalistic breach, having moved to Mafeking with her husband, Lt.-Col. Gordon Chesney Wilson, at the start of the war, where he was aide-de-camp to Col. Robert Baden-Powell, the commanding officer at Mafeking. Baden-Powell asked her to leave Mafeking for her own safety after the Boers threatened to storm the British garrison. This she duly did, and set off on a madcap adventure in the company of her maid, travelling through the South African countryside. Eventually, she was captured by the Boers and returned to the town in exchange for a horse thief being held there.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1813, Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune's 5th Division of the Army of Portugal counted 4,800 men. The {{division}} {{included two}} battalions {{each of the}} 15th, 66th, 82nd, and 86th Line Infantry Regiments. That day, one of the brigades was halted at the village of San Millán de San Zadornil. The leading brigade of the Light Division under John Ormsby Vandeleur marched up from the west and attacked. As Vandeleur's men pushed the French from the village and east along the road, Maucune's second brigade appeared from a rocky gorge to the southwest. The second brigade <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> rear of Vandeleur's brigade, but before the French {{could take advantage of}} the situation, James Kempt's brigade arrived on the scene. Kempt immediately attacked and, to avoid being taken in flank and rear, Maucune's second brigade left the road and began to retreat across the hillsides. Noticing what was going on behind him, Vandeleur pulled the 1st Battalion of the 52nd Foot out of line and turned it against the French second brigade. Under the pressure, Maucune's second brigade collapsed and the men ran away.|$|E

[...] On 29 August 1944 the Slovak Army rose up against the Nazis and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia was announced. Vrba joined the Czechoslovak partisan units in September 1944, and was later awarded the Czechoslovak Medal of Bravery.|$|E

500|$|Barnes is {{generally}} {{regarded as one of}} the best bowlers to have played international cricket, and finished his Test career with 189 wickets at an average of 16.43; his average places him among the top-ten bowlers in Test cricket. At the start of his career, he was a fast bowler who endeavoured to swing the ball, which was the common style of bowling at the time. However, Barnes experimented with bowling a little slower and cutting the ball, and developed both an off cutter and a leg cutter that he concluded were far more effective than swinging the ball. Despite his bowling talent, Barnes did not play any Test cricket between July 1902 and December 1907, as he was considered a [...] "prima donna" [...] who would only put in the effort when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> mood, and being suitably paid. After his recall to the England side, he played regularly until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and was named by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1910.|$|E

[...] For this, he was long vilified by Brooklyn Dodgers fans. However, Pro-O'Malley parties describe him as a visionary for the same business action, and many authorities cite him as one of the most influential sportsmen of the 20th century. Other observers say that he was not a visionary, but instead a man who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at the right time, and regard him as the most powerful and influential owner in baseball after moving the team.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the selection issues and injury problems surrounding England, Bangladesh came into the tour with a relatively stable squad. Uncapped players Nasir Hossain and Suhrawadi Shuvo were both named in the ODI squad, and Mashrafe Mortaza was fit to play after making it through the warm-up game against England for the BCB XI, having not played since July 2009 due to a knee injury. After playing in the first ODI, Mortaza withdrew from the squad for the remaining ODIs and Test matches, citing a disagreement over his fitness. The Bangladesh chairman of selectors, Rafiqul Alam, announced that Mortaza had withdrawn himself [...] "to be {{by the side of}} his ailing mother". Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh's most-capped player, was omitted from the Test squad as he had failed to convince the selectors that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> frame of mind for international cricket. The day after the squad had been announced, Bangladesh's preparations for the opening Test match were [...] "thrown into disarray" [...] when Raqibul Hasan announced his retirement from international cricket at the age of 22. It was reported that the retirement was due to Raqibul's displeasure at being omitted from the provisional squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. Uncapped Jahurul Islam was called into the squad to replace him.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, on 26 August, the Beatles {{travelled}} {{by train}} {{to the college}} campus in Bangor, Wales. It was perhaps {{the first time the}} band had travelled without their tour managers and they had not even thought to bring money. The station was mobbed because of a bank holiday and Cynthia Lennon, mistaken for a fan, was held back. She ran after the train but missed it and arrived later by car. The group, along with Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Cilla Black, Harrison's sister-in-law Jenny Boyd, and around 300 others, learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation, and were given their mantras. The group [...] "hesitated only slightly" [...] when asked to donate the customary week's wages, a large sum for a Beatle, to learn. While there, they announced at a press conference that they were giving up drugs (apparently referring to psychedelics, but not marijuana). This was a choice [...] "in keeping with the Maharishi's teachings" [...] but one made prior to meeting the Maharishi. The Maharishi did advise them privately to avoid involvement with the [...] "Ban the Bomb" [...] movement and to support the elected government of the day. Their intention was to attend the entire ten-day seminar but their stay was cut short by the death of their manager, Epstein, in London on 27 August. The Maharishi consoled them by saying that Epstein's spirit was still with them and their good thoughts would help him [...] "to have an easy passage" [...] and journey to his [...] "next evolution". According to McCartney, the Maharishi [...] "was great to us when Brian died" [...] and Cynthia Lennon wrote [...] "it was as though, with Brian gone, the four needed someone new to give them direction and the Maharishi <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at the right time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{patients}} whose brain damage <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hemisphere, left limb activation (LLA) was another treatment that proved effective. [...] The theory behind {{this method of}} treatment is that any use of the damaged side of the brain will enhance all functions related to the damaged hemisphere and that use of the opposite (healthy) side will only cause further impairment. [...] LLA therefore is merely the concentrated use of {{the left side of}} the body in {{patients whose}} damage is in the right hemisphere (since the right hemisphere controls {{the left side of the}} body). [...] This forces the patient to exercise spatial awareness using the damaged side of the brain, increasing activity around the lesion. [...] While generally a treatment used for visual neglect (a different but related neurological disorder), LLA still increases brain activity around damaged area in patients with visual extinction and generates improvement in some patients. [...] The reason this treatment does not work in some cases of visual extinction is that damage can be on either side of the brain as opposed to in visual neglect where the damage is always on the right.|$|E
