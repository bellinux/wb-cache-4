5|$|The {{red brick}} Trinity Methodist Church was {{completed}} in 1888. It has survived many troubles, including flooding in its opening year, damage {{on the night of}} 8/9 December 1940 by enemy action, and an arson attack on Christmas Eve 1980, when the church was only just saved from complete destruction by the presence of a police officer in a patrol car nearby, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> call the fire brigade.|$|E

5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|Enna-Dagan also {{received}} tribute, and his reign fell entirely within {{the reign of}} Irkab-Damu of Ebla, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> defeat Mari and end the tribute. Mari defeated Ebla's ally Nagar in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium's term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. The war reached a climax when the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish made an alliance with Nagar and Kish to defeat Mari in a battle near Terqa. Ebla itself suffered its first destruction {{a few years after}} Terqa in c. 2300 BC, during the reign of the Mariote king Hidar.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequent}} crashes of {{the retail}} Windows versions infuriated many reviewers; Game Revolution censured Interplay for focusing on censoring the game for marketing purposes instead of testing for and fixing the software bugs before release. Several reviewers could not connect to multiplayer games due to failed connections or bugs. The reviewers <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> play online, commented the games were fun, although they were occasionally disconnected or lagged. GamesFirst lamented the lack of dedicated low ping servers, and several reviewers declared that the computer versions of the game was flawed for not implementing an in-game save feature.|$|E

Villa was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies. Those <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|As {{holders of}} the competition, Arsenal was {{admitted}} into the Cup Winners' Cup for the 1994–95 season. They moreover contested in the 1994 European Super Cup, losing to Milan 2–0 on aggregate. In February 1995, Graham was sacked by Arsenal after it emerged he accepted an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge {{for two of}} his clients: Jensen and Pål Lydersen. He was replaced by caretaker manager Stewart Houston (Bruce Rioch in the close season), <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> take Arsenal into the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final after beating Sampdoria on penalties in the semi-finals. They however, did not retain the trophy after Real Zaragoza midfielder Nayim scored an extra-time goal, lobbing Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman.|$|E

5|$|Cleomenes, {{who was now}} {{confident}} {{of the strength of}} his position, began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him of the need {{to do away with the}} ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{suspects}} that the raptors {{are searching for}} something while observing two of them communicating. He becomes ambushed and cornered by the raptors, but is rescued by Eric, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> survive in an overturned water truck. The next day, Grant and Eric hear Paul's satellite phone ringing and are reunited with the Kirbys and Billy. Paul explains that he gave the phone to Nash before he was devoured, before the group is attacked by the Spinosaurus. After the group escapes, Grant discovers Billy took two raptor eggs to use for funding, which provoked the raptor attacks. He decides to keep the eggs to ensure the group's survival. The group unknowingly enters a large aviary used to house Pteranodons, which attack the group and fly away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric by using Ben's parasail, but is then attacked and seemingly killed by the Pteranodons. The {{rest of the group}} escapes the aviary, unintentionally leaving the door unlocked. They make their way downriver using a boat.|$|E
5|$|His father, Niccolò Polo, a merchant, traded {{with the}} Near East, {{becoming}} wealthy and achieving great prestige. Niccolò {{and his brother}} Maffeo set off on a trading voyage before Marco's birth. In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the Venetian quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured Venetian citizens were blinded, while many of those <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E

5|$|In April 1839, the {{accusation}} of poisoning the young prince in 1837, {{along with two}} other fabricated cases, was revived against Bhimsen and his party, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to incriminate him. Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor {{and put him in}} house arrest in a room at the ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidence, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public offices for seven generations.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Bulgarian envoys {{received}} {{a warm welcome}} by al-Mahdi. The Fatimid caliph accepted the Bulgarian terms and sent his own emissaries to Simeon I. However, {{on the way back}} their ship was captured by the Byzantines, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> outbid the Bulgarians and distract a Fatimid attack. The Bulgarians remained in control of most of the Balkans, annexing Byzantium's ally Serbia in 924, but without naval support were unable to launch a decisive attack on Constantinople. The war continued until the death of Simeon I in 927, when his son Peter I (r. 927–969) concluded a peace treaty with the Byzantines, who recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate in return for most of Simeon I's conquests in Thrace after 917.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet was {{the only}} driver not {{to start with the}} softer {{compound}} dry-weather tyres on a track which was still drying from morning rain, with the Brazilian opting for the harder tyre available. There was a strong chance of showers predicted during the race. Several cars were slow away on the slippery track, most notably Kovalainen. The main beneficiaries off the line were Piquet and Trulli, who each gained five places. Trulli was hit from behind at the first corner by Bourdais, who also had a quick start. The Toyota suffered diffuser and gearbox damage from the incident, spinning later in the lap. Kovalainen and Heidfeld also collided at the start. This allowed Alonso to gain several places. Sebastian Vettel locked his brakes and ran wide, losing two places. Fisichella collided with Nakajima on the first lap and had to pit to fix a broken front wing and punctures. Hamilton led from Räikkönen <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> pass his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on the Kemmel straight.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} topics of debate after 's rampage became the way police dealt with him, {{especially}} whether the first two responding officers were, under the circumstances, supposed to immediately engage and neutralize the perpetrator, and whether the decision {{to wait for the}} arrival of the tactical unit was sound. The debate became more vocal after a cook, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape the rampage, claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated. Another witness, who escaped unharmed, refuted this version of events, saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes leading up to the point of police entry, with no shots heard thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Rosas was {{determined}} to restore Argentine suzerainty over Uruguay and take revenge on Gonçalves. A series of interventions resulted. In 1839 an army led by Lavalleja, Oribe and Justo José de Urquiza, (Governor of Entre Rios) was quickly defeated by Rivera. At this point, Lavalleja {{turned his back on}} the conflict and played no further part in the civil war. Rosas sent another army of Argentines and Uruguayans in 1845, led by Oribe and Urquiza, and this time defeated Rivera's forces, slaughtering the survivors. Rivera {{was one of the few}} <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape, and went into exile in Rio de Janeiro. What remained of Rivera's Colorados held power only in the country's capital Montevideo as Oribe's forces began the Great Siege of Montevideo. The violence in Uruguay escalated, with Oribe's men killing more than 17,000 Uruguayans and 15,000 Argentinians during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{column of}} sixteen Spaniards {{retreating}} from Xocorro were ambushed at Guaxeregui and killed to a man. The only {{survivor of the}} expedition was a seriously wounded African slave. The reinforcements sent from Comayagua to the Peñol were also attacked in Cares, and had to fight their way through to join the Spanish at the Peñol, suffering considerable hardship. The citizens of Santa María de Comayagua appealed to Montejo for help, and he sent a dozen mixed cavalry and infantry, <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> break through the hostile natives encircling the settlement, and reinforce the town, where they were cut off from further Spanish assistance. Montejo was left with only eleven soldiers, and returned to Gracias a Dios to protect the colonists there, who included women and children. The Indians killed isolated Spaniards wherever they could find them. The natives, seeing {{the success of their}} fortress at Cerquín, started construction of a similar fortress near Gracias a Dios, and gathered a great quantity of supplies in storehouses there. Montejo urgently needed to halt their progress, but was unable to attack directly. Instead, he sent an African servant <b>who</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> set the storehouses ablaze. The dismayed Indians of that district then sued for peace. A local Indian ruler called Mota plotted to attack Gracias a Dios, but the plan was betrayed to Monetejo. In a lighning raid, Mota was seized and taken back to Gracias as a prisoner, only to escape and resume his plans for an assault. Montejo eventually discovered his hiding place and launched another rapid raid, and kept him hostage in Gracias under close guard as guarantor of his people, thus defusing the immediate threat against Gracias a Dios.|$|E
