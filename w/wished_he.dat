5|$|During the {{shooting}} in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time. Forster <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> {{had more time to}} work on the free-fall scene.|$|E
5|$|Many who memorialized Stevens {{after his}} death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer. He was {{involved}} in the first ten cases to reach the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from Adams County after he began practice, and won nine. One case he later <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had not won was Butler v. Delaplaine, in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner.|$|E

I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> was deaf. I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> was blind. Hang him,' cried Brass, as the chant began again. 'I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> was dead!' ...|$|R

'I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> may be {{an honest}} man, that's all,' said Solomon, winding up a variety of speculations {{relative}} to the stranger, concerning whom Gabriel had compared notes with the company, and so raised a grave discussion; 'I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> {{may be an}} honest man.' ...|$|R
5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had made the call {{on the evening of}} the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> continued working on it after release, believing he could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating that the notion is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). He <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E

5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most {{of the credit for}} the 3–2 win, some commentators <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had made an effort to run up a bigger score.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector AM Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated {{much of what}} Chintanda {{had said}} {{regarding}} Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and {{had told him to}} have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma said that he would not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he had suggested if the Company <b>wished.</b> <b>He</b> made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E
5000|$|The poem {{describes}} a child's {{longing for the}} freedom he sees {{in the lives of}} those around him. When the gong sounds ten in the morning, he walks to his school and sees the hawker crying [...] "Bangles, crystal bangles!" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> could be a hawker. At four in the afternoon, while coming back from school, he sees the gardener digging the ground and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> were a gardener. When dusk falls his mother sends him to bed and he sees the watchman through the window and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> could be a watchman.|$|R

5|$|Cerny's {{personal}} interests changed throughout the project, {{leading to the}} inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents. The game's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses. Atari's management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to Pac-Man. As a compromise, the cabinet's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles. Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional physics model to dictate the marble's motions and an interpreted script for enemy behavior. As Marble Madness neared completion, the feedback from Atari's in-house focus testing was positive. In retrospect, Cerny <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles {{at the time and}} could not extend the game's development period as it would have left their production factory idle.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} written eight years later, Rodriguez said he regretted signing with the Texas Rangers and <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had {{signed with the}} New York Mets instead, {{and that he had}} heeded the advice of his agent, Scott Boras. (See Opt out controversy).|$|E
25|$|Remington's Self-Portrait on a Horse (1890) {{shows the}} artist as he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> was, not the pot-bellied Easterner {{weighing}} heavily on a horse, but a tough, lean cowboy heading for adventure with his trusty steed. It was the image his publishers worked hard to maintain as well.|$|E

60|$|It {{would be}} the same, while ever Beatrice was Beatrice and Siegmund her husband. He ate his bread and cheese mechanically, {{wondering}} why he was miserable, why he was not looking forward with joy to the morrow.

25|$|After this victory, Böhme was {{transferred}} to Jasta 2 {{under the command of}} Oswald Boelcke. Boelcke was not only a well-established ace, but was pioneering the tactics and strategy of fighter aviation. He had carte blanche to recruit such pilots as he <b>wished.</b> <b>He</b> had asked for, among others, both Manfred von Richthofen and Böhme. Boelcke and Böhme became best friends.|$|E
25|$|AIPC {{grew out}} of an idea from its founder, Rick Barsness. When Barsness was a hockey player in high school, his team reached the state championships, but his father never {{attended}} a game. His father's absence nurtured a boyhood dream of a place where families could eat and have fun together. This {{was the type of}} place Barsness <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> could have spent time with his father.|$|E

At the 2006 PBL AGM, Kerry's son James told of the true complexities of the deal. Kerry received A$800million in cash, with A$250million left in Bond Media as subordinated debt. As Alan Bond went under, Packer converted the subordinated debt into a 37% stake in Bond Media.|$|E

25|$|During {{his service}} on the high court, White wrote 994 opinions. He was fierce in {{questioning}} attorneys in court, and his votes and opinions on the bench reflect an ideology that has been notoriously difficult for popular journalists and legal scholars alike to pin down. He {{was seen as a}} disappointment by some Kennedy supporters who <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> would have joined the more liberal wing of the court in its opinions on Miranda v. Arizona and Roe v. Wade.|$|E
25|$|He {{first thought}} of {{studying}} medicine while at The Leys School, {{a boarding school}} in Cambridge, when he fractured his clavicle and recorded in his diary that he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> could treat himself. He began pre-clinical studies at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1914 but, {{with the onset of}} World War I, his studies were interrupted when he was made a medical trainee at the temporary hospital in Cambridge. In 1917, he joined the Royal Navy as a medical officer on the destroyer HMS Lucifer.|$|E
25|$|The next church he {{designed}} was St Andrew's Hove, East Sussex, in Waterloo Street, Brunswick, (1827–28); {{the plan of}} the building {{is in line with}} Georgian architecture, though stylistically the Italianate style was used, the only classical church Barry designed that was actually built. The Gothic Hurstpierpoint church (1843–45), with its tower and spire, unlike his earlier churches was much closer to the Cambridge Camden Society's approach to church design. According to the his son Alfred, Barry later disowned these early church designs of the 1820s and <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> could destroy them.|$|E
