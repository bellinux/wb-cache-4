5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E

The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance.

5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of the road was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E

Spaces for worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (haiden) in addition to the main hall (honden). The following stylistic elements of Buddhist temple architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, optical fiber technology <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> {{one of these}} early gastrocameras to produce the first flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
