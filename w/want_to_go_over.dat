500|$|David Gauntlett, {{author of}} Media, gender, and identity: an {{introduction}} (2002), noted that, despite wanting her lover {{next to her}} in the song, Spears' [...] "fans see her as assertive, strong and confident, and an example that young women can make it on their own". The singer revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone, the writers had to re-write the original lyrics of the song. [...] "I asked them to change the words to 'Born to Make You Happy.' It was a sexual song," [...] she revealed. [...] "I said, 'This may be a little old for me.' Because of the image thing, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the top. If I come out being Miss Prima Donna, that wouldn't be smart. I want to have a place to grow".|$|E

[...] "She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the ground her brother traversed--you {{have heard of}} that project. Nasmyth sailed a week earlier to arrange matters at this end; but I don't know how Miss Hume will get along." ...|$|R
50|$|As stated before, Telearuba {{operated}} as {{a commercial}} station. In the past commercial consisted of slides, pictures, film or Live. After that, the format changed to ¾ inch. This gave the commercials a new dimension and was more attractive in color. When Telearuba <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> into they had to decide on a compatible one. It was confirmed that Venezuela would use the same system as USA, NTSC {{and that is what}} Telearuba started with on 12 July 1973.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary {{and some}} of the others <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to Bluebell Island," [...] said Fred. [...] "They say there are some very fine ferns to be had there, and they thought maybe they would have a chance {{to take some of the}} ferns home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An English {{man-of-war}} {{got hold}} of him after awhile, an' he was strung on the yardarm to dry. If I'd been {{in command of the}} vessel he should have found out how it felt to be roasted. Say, don't you boys <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to Potter's cay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be seated, please. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> {{our case}} with you. First of all, I {{want you to}} tell me once more, and in full detail, all you know of your mother's life. Begin at the {{beginning}} and leave nothing out. Don't theorize or try to explain--give me the facts as you have observed them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Randel {{met with}} Benjamin Wright, the future [...] "Father of American Civil Engineering", {{who was then}} the chief {{engineer}} for {{the central part of the}} canal. Wright was reviewing all the proposed routes, and Randel <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> his proposed route, which Wright had apparently not seen before. Some days later Randel obtained some of Wright's calculations on the cost of soil removal, which he disputed, telling Wright so in a letter, and informing him that he planned on publishing his concerns.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the boys}} {{never heard of}} how Joel Fox fared when his wife got home. The lady arrived [...] "as mad as a hornet," [...] to use a popular saying. [...] "You're the worst old fool ever was, Joel Fox!" [...] were her first words, and a bitter quarrel {{followed}} that ended only when the man was driven {{out of the house}} with the ever-trustworthy broom. Joel Fox <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Rover farm, to have it out with Tom and Sam, but somehow he could not pluck up the courage to make the move.|$|R
5000|$|Stevie Nicks asked Buckingham {{to remove}} the lyrics [...] "Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do", but Buckingham refused. In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Nicks gave her thoughts on the matter. [...] "I very much resented him telling the world that 'packing up, shacking up' with different men was all I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. He knew it wasn't true. It was just an angry thing that he said. Every time those words would come onstage, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> and kill him. He knew it, so he really pushed my buttons through that. It was like, 'I'll make you suffer for leaving me.' And I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will not}} do at all," [...] I said excitedly. [...] "When I last saw you, you did not talk like that, and the {{opinions}} you expressed at that time are just as good now as they were then. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> this matter with you. There are things that I {{have a right to}} know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish I had one {{of those}} new kind of machine pumps on the car," [...] {{answered}} Roger. [...] "But I haven't got it, so it's got to be bone labor, boys." [...] And then the damaged wheel was jacked up and a new shoe with its inner tube was put on and inflated. All told, the job took the boys a full half-hour, for the new shoe was a tight fit and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the rim at first.|$|E
6000|$|... "STUFF!" [...] said Lady Marayne for {{a second}} time. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "well. Your Mrs. Fly-by-Night,--oh it doesn't matter!--whatever she calls herself, must look after herself. I can't do {{anything}} for her. I'm not supposed even to know about her. I daresay she'll find her consolations. I suppose {{you want to go}} out of London and get away from it all. I can help you there, perhaps. I'm tired of London too. It's been a tiresome season. Oh! tiresome and disappointing! I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to Ireland and travel about a little. The Pothercareys want us to come. They've asked us twice...." ...|$|E
50|$|A temptation {{challenge}} {{is presented to}} the contestants: whether to control their diets or control the game. Players are put into private booths and given small, 100-calorie cupcakes. For each team, only one player will weigh in for the entire team that week. The reward {{for the person who}} eats the most cupcakes in 10 minutes is to choose which player will represent each team at the weigh-in. Antoine eats one cupcake, causing Tracey to panic and start eating cupcakes when Ali announces that someone is winning. Tracey wins, having eaten four cupcakes. When Bob and Jillian find out, Jillian is furious and says she's done working with Tracey. She says she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> there and throttle her.|$|R
6000|$|... "That, of course, {{will depend}} {{a good deal}} on you and your folks," [...] {{answered}} Spouter. [...] "My folks are already out there, getting the ranch in readiness for visitors. I suppose you'll <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home <b>over</b> the Fourth of July, but maybe you'll {{be able to start}} West right after that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Blacktown bank," [...] Mr. Wright said to Sam when {{he entered}} the building. [...] "The train leaves in half an hour, and since you can return by the same {{conveyance}} {{there is no reason why}} I should give two boys a holiday, as I did yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, patriotism {{is not a}} {{thing that}} flourishes in the void,--one needs a foreigner. A {{national}} and patriotic party is an anti-foreign party; the altar of the modern god, Democracy, will cry aloud for the stranger men. Simply to keep in power, and out of no love of mischief, the government or the party machine will have to insist upon dangers and national differences, to keep the voter to the poll by alarms, seeking ever to taint the possible nucleus of any competing organization with the scandal of external influence. The party press will play the watch-dog and allay all internal dissensions with its warning bay at some adjacent people, and the adjacent peoples, for reasons to be presently expanded, will be continually more sensitive to such baying. Already one sees country yelping at country all over the modern world, {{not only in the}} matter of warlike issues, but with a note of quite furious commercial rivalry--quite furious and, indeed, quite insane, since its ideal of trading enormously with absolutely ruined and tradeless foreigners, exporting everything and importing nothing, is obviously outside reason altogether. The inexorable doom of these governments based on the grey, is to foster enmity between people and people. Even their alliances are but sacrifices to intenser antagonisms. And the phases of the democratic sequence are simple and sure. Forced on by a relentless competition, the tone of the outcries will become fiercer and fiercer; the occasions of excitement, the perilous moments, the ingenuities of annoyance, more and more dramatic,--from the mere emptiness and disorder of the general mind! Jealousies and anti-foreign enactments, tariff manipulations and commercial embitterment, destructive, foolish, exasperating obstructions that benefit no human being, will minister to this craving without completely allaying it. Nearer, and ever nearer, the politicians of the coming times will force one another towards the verge, not because they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> it, not because any one wants to go over it, but because they are, by their very nature, compelled to go that way, because to go in any other direction is to break up and lose power. And, consequently, the final development of the democratic system, so far as intrinsic forces go, will be, not the rule of the boss, nor the rule of the trust, nor the rule of the newspaper; no rule, indeed, but international rivalry, international competition, international exasperation and hostility, and at last--irresistible and overwhelming--the definite establishment of the rule of that most stern and educational of all masters--War.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{more deeply}} moved than I can say by {{the receipt of}} your so admirably vivid and {{interesting}} letter.... I envy you intensely your opportunity to apply that [spirit of observation] in these immense historic conditions and thus {{to have had a}} hand of your own in the most prodigious affirmation of the energy and ingenuity of man ("however misplaced"!) that surely can ever have been in the world. For God's sake go on taking as many notes of it as you possibly can, and believe with what grateful piety I shall <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> your treasure with you when you finally bring it home. Such impressions as you must get, such incalculable things as you must see, such unutterable ones as you must feel! Well, keep it all up, and above all keep up that same blest confidence in my fond appreciation. Wonderful your account of that night visit to the trenches and giving me more of the sense and the smell and the fantastic grimness, the general ordered and methodised horror, than anything else whatever that has pretended to enlighten us. With infinite interest do I take in what you say of the rapidity with which the inside-out-ness of your conditions becomes the matter of course and the platitudinous--which I take partly to result from the tremendous collectivity of the case, doesn't it? the fact of the wholeness of the stress and strain or intimate fusion, as in a common pot, of all exposures, all resistances, all the queerness and all the muchness! But I mustn't seem to put too interrogatively my poor groping speculations. Only wait to correct my mistakes in some better future, and I shall understand you down to the ground. We add day to day here as consciously, or labouringly, as you are doing, no doubt, on your side--it's in fact like lifting every 24 hours, just now, a very dismally dead weight and setting it on top of a pile of such others, already stacked, which promises endlessly to grow--so that the mere reaching up adds all the while to the beastly effort. London is grey--in moral tone; and even the Zeppelin bombs of last night at Yarmouth do little to make it flush. What a pitiful horror indeed must that Ypres desolation and desecration be--a baseness of demonism. I find, thank God, that under your image of that I at least can flush. It so happens that I dine to-morrow (23d) with John Sargent, or rather I mean lunch, and I shall take for granted your leave to read him your letter. I bless you again for it, and am yours all faithfully, ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{concert was}} put {{together}} by the Make a Difference Foundation, its founder, rock producer and manager Doc McGhee, Stas Namin and other {{major players in the}} Soviet Union and the United States. It is often stated that McGhee agreed to bring his artists to Moscow after becoming involved in a drug scandal himself and wishing to avoid a jail sentence, but he explicitly denied that in 2011. [...] "We always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Moscow and do the first rock show in the Soviet Union. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do their Woodstock." [...] Since it had also been part of that plan that the proceeds would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Make a Difference and doctors would be brought to the USSR to teach methods of treating addiction (Soviet doctors at the time primarily used electroshock therapy for that purpose), he did not expect the sentencing judge would have denied him the opportunity.|$|R

That was why I never <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see you. I knew quite well I ought to go--even our simple Four Winds customs demanded that. But I couldn't. I used to watch you from my window--I could see {{you and your husband}} strolling about your garden in the evening--or you running down the poplar lane to meet him. And it hurt me. And yet in another way I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over.</b> I felt that, if I were not so miserable, I could have liked you and found in you what I've never had in my life--an intimate, REAL friend of my own age.

Let's just say his hand-eye coordination is not what it needs to be." [...] Nicholas Hoult and other zombie actors practiced with circus performers to achieve the right body moves. Hoult explained, [...] "There were some days with the Cirque du Soleil people and we would take our shoes off in a dance studio and we would kind of grow out of the wall and make our bodies feel very heavy.

This morning, I will try to cover a lot of ground. I’ll survey the economic landscape, and give you my reading of the outlook for the national economy. I’ll also discuss the situation in San Diego and finish with some comments about monetary policy. In particular, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> a matter that’s on the minds of many people right now: the Federal Reserve’s strategy for winding down the extraordinary measures taken during the financial and economic crisis of the past few years. My comments reflect my own views, and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. Given the dismal economic news we faced for so long, it’s a great relief for me to report that the tide appears to have turned. We are seeing convincing evidence that an economic recovery is well under way. Still, as I’ll explain in greater detail in a few minutes, the fact that the economy is growing again doesn’t mean we’re where we ought to be. Far from it. In particular, the unemployment rate is unacceptably high, creating real hardship for millions of Americans. But, at least we’re heading in the right direction. Let me start with the good news.

He had told his father that he had brought nothing with him but what he had on; and in truth when he left Colmar he had not looked forward to any welcome which would induce him to remain at Granpere. But the course of things had been different from that which he had expected. He was much too good a general to think of returning now, and he had friends in the house {{who knew how to}} supply him with what was most necessary to him. Nobody had asked him to stay. His father had not uttered a word of welcome. But he did stay, and Michel would have been very much surprised indeed if he had heard that he had gone.
