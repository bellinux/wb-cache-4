500|$|Alesi {{attacked}} Briatore's role {{in preventing}} the drivers from abiding by the pact {{that was to}} see no overtaking {{in the first two}} chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race. Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he [...] "behaved like a perfect leader". Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: [...] "We are race car drivers, Because <b>we</b> <b>signed</b> contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars. Because we knew a year ago {{that there would be a}} race at Monza and nobody complained." [...] FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{remaining}} unenthusiastic {{with the}} script, Kanter agreed to commission it {{as a film}} {{on the condition that}} he reserve the right to select a [...] "" [...] director. Anderson would have selected David Lane, who had directed the two Thunderbirds film sequels, Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968). After a ten-week delay to filming, Robert Parrish, an American director whose latest project had been shelved, accepted the post. Parrish's film career up to 1968 had included co-editing Body and Soul (for which he had shared the 1947 Academy Award for Best Film Editing) and co-directing the 1967 James Bond spoof, Casino Royale. Anderson remembered Parrish as being [...] "very ingratiating", stating that he [...] "told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to work with us. Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs up and we were in business." [...] Although the box office failure of Casino Royale had prompted Anderson to question Parrish's ability, he stated that Doppelgänger could not have been made without his recruitment: [...] "It wasn't a question of, 'Will we get on with him?' or, 'Is he the right man?' He was a name director, so <b>we</b> <b>signed</b> him up immediately." ...|$|E

In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he'd made the decision that we were just going to go with whatever the label reckoned.

[...] "Neither party has any hard feelings," [...] {{he said of the}} split a few months later. [...] "I think for us, the reason why <b>we</b> <b>signed</b> with Columbia was because of the people that were there. So it's very understandable when all those people are gone, you don't hold any real bad feelings or good feelings towards a company name. I think that's part of the problem with the corporate entity as a whole is that there's no true responsibility."

2500|$|In early 2008, {{the group}} {{coalesced}} {{under the name}} Cash Cash, with members Jean Paul Makhlouf, Alexander Makhlouf, and Samuel Frisch.

We got hit with a ton of legal notices about it from the person who owned the name, and had this old agent trying to screw us over, so when putting the new group together out of frustration, I was like, we should just name this group 'Cash Cash' because every one is after our cash, and we don't have any yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 23 the sale agreement had been completed. Early reports indicated Hicks would remain a minority owner {{with the club}} and would serve on the board in a non-voting honorary position. Approval from the executive and ownership committee, the banks who were owed money by HSG, and 75% of MLB owners was still required before the sale could have been finalized. The new company would be called Rangers Baseball Express. Greenberg would serve as CEO and managing partner, and Ray Davis and Bob Simpson would be co-chairmen of the board. As {{a part of the}} original purchase agreement, Rangers Baseball Express also would acquire approximately [...] of land adjacent to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and Cowboys Stadium. A separate company owned by Hicks owns the land. After the land sale was announced, Hicks was sued by a former partner over the land. The former partner claims Hicks never dissolved the partnership that was formed when the two groups were planning the development called Glorypark. Hicks was also sued by an architectural firm, RTKL, and a construction company, Vratsinas, for $6.9 million of unpaid work done over three years ago. Greenberg posted the following on his Facebook page after the original purchase agreement was announced:Tonight was a big night for Nolan Ryan and me as <b>we</b> <b>signed</b> the definitive agreement to purchase the Texas Rangers.

2500|$|Slash was {{replaced}} by Nine Inch Nails touring guitarist Robin Finck in January 1997, who signed a two-year contract with the band in August 1997, making him an official member. Finck was originally recommended by Matt Sorum to Rose a year earlier as a possible second guitarist to complement Slash. Slash's departure was followed shortly thereafter by Matt Sorum in April 1997, who was fired by Rose after getting in an argument about Tobias's inclusion in the band. Sorum later stated Tobias was the [...] "Yoko Ono of Guns N' Roses". McKagan {{was the last of}} the Appetite lineup to leave, resigning as bassist in August 1997. McKagan had recently become a father and wrote about his decision to leave in his autobiography, stating [...] "Guns had been paying rent on studios for three years now—from 1994 to 1997—and still did not have a single song. The whole operation was so erratic that it didn't seem to fit with my hopes for parenthood, for stability." [...] McKagan {{was replaced}} later that year by former Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson. An actual break-up of Guns N' Roses never occurred, as new players were brought in as the old ones left. Rose reportedly purchased the full rights to the Guns N' Roses name in 1997. Slash claimed he and bandmates signed over the name in duress, stating [...] "Axl refused to go onstage one night during the Use Your Illusion tour in 1992 unless the band signed away the name rights to the band. Unfortunately, <b>we</b> <b>signed</b> it. I didn't think he'd go on stage otherwise." [...] Rose denied the claim, saying [...] "(it) Never happened, all made up, fallacy and fantasy. Not one single solitary thread of truth to it. Had that been the case I would have been cremated years ago legally, could've cleaned me out for the name and damages.

2500|$|... "Omichund, his {{confidential}} servant, as he thought, {{told his}} master {{of an agreement}} made between the English and Monsieur Duprée [...] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding {{this to be the}} man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We therefore made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr. Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nawab; and that Mr. Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr. Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose <b>we</b> <b>signed</b> another treaty. The one was called the Red, the other the White treaty. This treaty was signed by every one, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with me, that, when the very existence of the Company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, {{it was a matter of}} true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain." ...|$|E
