Silko's <b>writing</b> <b>skill</b> in the novel is deeply rooted in the use of storytelling that pass on traditions and understanding from the old to the new.

40|$|Although {{there are}} a number of studies on English <b>writing</b> <b>skills,</b> the {{relation}} among metalearning, cognitive holding power and <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> is not well understood. Thus, this study investigated the relation among metalearning capacity (high versus low) and cognitive holding power (CHP; first-order versus second-order) in explaining the English Language <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> of Egyptian pre-service teachers. We constructed and validated new measures of metalearning and English <b>writing</b> <b>skills,</b> and adapted an existing measure of CHP for use with our Egyptian sample. Participants with high metalearning capacity demonstrated better <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> than those with low metalearning capacity. In addition, participants with second-order CHP exhibited better <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> than those with first-order CHP. The two factors made independent contributions (i. e., did not interact) because, we argue that metalearning operates at the level of the individual learner whereas CHP is an attribute of the larger instructional environment (as orchestrated by the teacher). These findings generalize and extend our current understanding of the role of metalearning and CHP in developing <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> to a new population, and establish the utility of newly developed and adapted instruments and adapted instruments. They also set the stage for future interventions for developing better English <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> in pre-service teachers...|$|R

In retrospective reviews, critics considered that the novel had aged badly, and that Terhune displayed little actual <b>writing</b> <b>skill,</b> but noted that the novel was able to hold long-lasting appeal as it triggered the reader's desire to have such an ideal dog.

2500|$|The Mystery of the Sea is a first-person, {{past tense}} {{narrative}} {{from the point}} of view of Archibald Hunter, the male protagonist. The representations of events in the novel are strongly colored by Archibald's feelings and reflections on his experience. The novel often takes on a fatalistic and sometimes sentimental tone, drawing on the strong emotions, fatalism, and romanticized descriptions of nature in earlier Gothic novels. The Mystery of the Sea is not written in a series of journal entries and personal correspondence like Dracula, and it lacks a clear narrative frame except for certain instances when Archibald indicates that he is looking back on events and reflecting. The novel, does, however, include an appendix with the testimonies of the sixteenth-century Spaniards involved with the hiding of the treasure as well as some examples of the Baconian Cipher, echoing other adventure novels (such as Rider Haggard's [...] ) that incorporate [...] "real" [...] documents into the fictional fabric of events. The novel, due to its memoir-like structure, is presented as a recollection of factual events, and is sensationalist and melodramatic in its fast-paced, busy plot, but it lacks the immediate currency of such epistolary classics as Dracula, and earlier, The Woman in White. Contemporary reviewers of The Mystery of the Sea generally expressed contentment with his rather melodramatic writing style even if they seemed to tire of the melodramatic plot content. One reviewer, for instance, called the novel [...] "exceedingly well written", and others admired Stoker's <b>writing</b> <b>skill</b> despite what they considered over-workings of the plot.|$|E

[...] He also praised Michelle Ruff's voice acting in the English dub. Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman also praised Sinon's portrayal, noting her to be [...] "a much more interesting character" [...] than both Kirito or Asuna, as [...] "what makes Sinon a more successful character than any to previously appear in the main series is that she has more depth. Rather than being just a scared or traumatized character, she's someone who is actively working to change herself [...] it feels like this is a turning point for Kawahara's <b>writing</b> <b>skill.</b> Sinon isn't perfectly depicted, but she's got more going on than previous characters." [...] Sam of The Otaku's Study similarly noted how Sinon already established herself as [...] "one of the most developed Sword Art Online characters" [...] despite appearing in only 7 episodes thus far, praising her backstory and contrast between her in-game and out-of-game personas.|$|E
