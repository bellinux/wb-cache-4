5|$|Hondo {{continued}} to quickly strengthen, becoming a tropical cyclone, {{the equivalent of}} a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, that same day. After maintaining its through the early hours of February6, a pinhole eye began to develop, signifying that Hondo was beginning to undergo rapid intensification. During this intensification phase, the storm became nearly stationary again due to a weakness in the ridge which was previously steering the cyclone towards the east. Later that day, Hondo was upgraded to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds). After becoming an intense tropical cyclone, wind shear began to increase, causing the eye to become slightly disorganized, temporarily slowed the intensification. Later in the day, the eye became better defined, allowing Hondo to intensify further. Operationally, Hondo was upgraded to a very intense tropical cyclone with winds of 220km/h (140mph 10-minute winds) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> pressure of 906hPa (mbar). However, after reanalysis, it was found that Hondo never intensified beyond intense tropical cyclone status and winds peaked at 215km/h (130mph 10-minute winds) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> pressure of 915hPa (mbar).|$|E
