2500|$|Smog is {{a serious}} problem in many cities and {{continues}} to harm human health. Ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. It can inflame breathing passages, decrease the lungs' <b>working</b> <b>capacity,</b> cause shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. It can cause eye and nose irritation and it dries out the protective membranes of the nose and throat and interferes with the body's ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility to illness. Hospital admissions and respiratory deaths often increase during periods when ozone levels are high. There is a lack of knowledge on the long-term effects of air pollution exposure and the origin of asthma. An experiment was carried out using intense air pollution {{similar to that of the}} 1952 Great Smog of London. The results from this [...] experiment concluded that there is a link between early-life pollution exposure that leads to the development of asthma, Proposing the ongoing effect of the Great Smog.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through {{physisorption}} or chemisorption {{based on}} the porosity and selectivity of the MOF leaving behind a Greenhouse gas poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the [...] {{is removed from the}} sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing , have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water. Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired. Additionally, high <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much [...] as possible from the flue gas. However, there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure. As the amount of [...] captured increases, the energy, and therefore cost, required to regenerate increases. A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability. Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS, but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF. Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs.|$|E

Manic, hypomanic, and {{depressed}} mood {{states have been}} shown to be associated with significant impairments in <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity.</b> Previous studies on mood state and <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> have included only participants formally diagnosed with a bipolar disorder. No study has examined this relationship in persons who experience fluctuations in mood state but do not meet diagnostic criteria for a bipolar disorder. Nor have previous studies examined the relationship between mood state and <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> in college students, where <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> may be particularly important to academic performance. In addition, few studies of these variables have been conducted in the participants' daily lives, rather than in laboratory settings. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between mood state and <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> in the daily lives of college students who experience frequent fluctuations in mood state. Four female and three male participants completed multiple daily mood state ratings and tests of <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> using an ecological momentary assessment task. Significant relationships were observed between concurrent measures of mood state and <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> for three out of seven participants. A significant relationship was also observed between time-lagged measures of mood state and <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> for one out of seven participants. Finally, no relationship was observed between time-lagged measures of <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> and mood state.

40|$|Working memory {{capacity}} {{is one of}} the most important cognitive functions influencing individual traits, such as attentional control, fluid intelligence, and also psychopathological traits. Previous research suggests that anxiety is associated with impaired cognitive function, and studies have shown low verbal <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> in individuals with high trait anxiety. However, the relationship between trait anxiety and visual <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> is still unclear. Considering that people allocate visual attention more widely to detect danger under threat, visual <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> might be higher in anxious people. In the present study, we show that visual <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> increases as trait social anxiety increases by using a change detection task. When the demand to inhibit distractors increased, however, high visual <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> diminished in individuals with social anxiety, and instead, impaired filtering of distractors was predicted by trait social anxiety. State anxiety was not correlated with visual <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity.</b> These results indicate that socially anxious people could potentially hold a large amount of information in working memory. However, because of an impaired cognitive function, they could not inhibit goal-irrelevant distractors and their performance decreased under highly demanding conditions...|$|R

5000|$|One {{important}} question facing {{the study of}} mind-wandering is how it relates to <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity.</b> Recent research has studied the relationship between mind-wandering and <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity.</b> This relationship requires more research to understand how they influence one another. It is possible that mind-wandering causes lower performance on <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> tasks or that lower <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> causes more instances of mind-wandering. Although only this last one has actually been proven. Also, reports of task-unrelated thoughts are less frequent when performing tasks that do not demand continuous use of working memory than tasks which do. [...] Moreover, individual difference studies demonstrate that when tasks are non-demanding, high levels of <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> are associated with more frequent reports of task-unrelated thinking especially when it {{is focused on the}} future. [...] By contrast, when performing tasks that demand continuous attention, high levels of <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> are associated with fewer reports of task-unrelated thoughts. [...] Together these data are consistent with the claim that <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> helps sustain a train of thought whether it is generated in response to a perceptual event or is self-generated by the individual. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the experience of mind-wandering is supported by working memory resources. Working memory capacity variation in individuals has been proven to be a good predictor of the natural tendency for mind-wandering to occur during cognitively demanding tasks and various activities in daily life.|$|R
