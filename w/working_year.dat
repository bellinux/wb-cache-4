In the 2,295 parishes, there was in each an average of at least ten beggars carrying on their trade the whole year round; the total number of these wandering paupers he puts down at over 34,000.

40|$|Objectives: Mental {{disorders}} are prevalent diagnoses in disability benefit statistics, with awards often granted at younger age than for other diagnoses. We aimed {{to compare the}} number of lost <b>working</b> <b>years</b> following disability benefit award for mental disorders versus other diagnostic groups. Methods: Data from the complete Norwegian official registry over disability benefit incidence, including primary diagnoses, were analyzed for the period 2001 to 2003 (N = 77, 067), a time-period without any reform in the disability benefit scheme. Lost <b>working</b> <b>years</b> due to disability benefit award before scheduled age retirement at age 67 were calculated. Results: Musculoskeletal disorders were the commonest reason for disability benefit awards (36. 3 %) with mental disorders in second place (24. 0 %). However, mental disorders {{were responsible for the}} most <b>working</b> <b>years</b> lost (33. 8 %) compared with musculoskeletal disorders (29. 4 %). Individuals awarded disability benefit for a mental disorder were on average 8. 9 years younger (46. 1 years) than individuals awarded for a musculoskeletal disorder (55. 0 years), and 6. 9 years younger than individuals awarded for any other somatic disorder (53. 0 years). Anxiety and depressive disorders were the largest contributors to lost <b>working</b> <b>years</b> within mental disorders. Conclusion: Age at award is highly relevant when the total burden of different diagnoses on disability benefits is considered.

40|$|Objectives The {{following}} study analyses {{the influence}} of risk factors among the occupational group of truck drivers on postural control and body mass index (BMI). Design Observational study. Setting One motorway station close to several highways in Germany. Participants 180 truck drivers (177 male/ 3 female), aged 21 – 65 years old, took part in this study. Outcome measures Postural control was examined using a pressure plate. In order to examine {{the influence of}} body weight (BMI) and <b>working</b> <b>years</b> on postural control, subjects were divided into samples of five and three groups, respectively. Furthermore, it was evaluated whether the subjects suffered from back pain. For data analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test {{was used as the}} data were not normally distributed. Once the p value of the Kruskal-Wallis test was p≤ 0. 05,[*]the Conover-Iman comparison and afterwards the Bonferroni-Holm correction were used. The significance level was set at α ≤ 0. 05. Results Regarding the number of <b>working</b> <b>years,</b> a significant increase of frontal (p≤ 0. 04) and sagittal (p≤ 0. 001) sway were observed. The correlation of the five BMI groups with the number of <b>working</b> <b>years</b> demonstrates that an increase of the <b>working</b> <b>years</b> leads to an increase of BMI (p≤ 0. 03).

50|$|In July 2013 Sole Food {{opened the}} largest urban orchard in North America {{at the corner}} of Main St. and Terminal Ave. in Vancouver, Canada. It was leased to Sole Food by the city of Vancouver for $1 per year. The land, which had {{previously}} been an old gas station site, had been empty for over a decade due to contamination in the soil. Sole Food was able to circumvent this by the use of the aforementioned portable planters. They planted 500 trees at the orchard which includes several types of fruits such as apple and pear as well as many different types of culinary herbs.The orchard is scheduled to reach commercial production levels between 2016 and 2018.

This is challenged by the twin theories of the ‘industrious ’ revolution and the consumer revolution, positing a longer <b>working</b> <b>year</b> as people earned surplus money to buy novel goods. In this study, we turn the conventional view on its head, fixing consumption rather than labour input. Specifically, we design a basket of basic consumption goods and compute the <b>working</b> <b>year</b> of rural and urban day labourers required to achieve that. By comparing with independent estimates of the actual <b>working</b> <b>year,</b> we find two ‘industrious revolutions ’ among rural workers; both are attributable to economic hardship, and we detect no signs of a consumer revolution. For urban labourers, by contrast, a growing gap between their actual <b>working</b> <b>year</b> and the work required to buy the basket provides great scope for a consumer revolution...|$|E
