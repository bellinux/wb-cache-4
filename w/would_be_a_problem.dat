Patterson's Column was ordered to entrench Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Suweileh in case they moved westwards. On the Royal Fusiliers' right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade closely guarded the country to the south, in particular the Madaba to Naur to Ain Hummar road across the plateau, with a strong detachment occupying Ain es Sir. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade sent a detachment at about midday on 26 September to investigate a report of Ottoman and German soldiers with guns at Er Rumman, but none were found. They subsequently sent a second detachment east of Amman to watch the Darb el Haj. The 20th Indian Brigade of infantry arrived after dark on 26 September to take over garrison duties at Amman.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

The council's chief executive, David Kent, wrote to all councillors after the meeting telling them that a rate had to be set {{by the end of}} March, and pressure appeared also from the Department of Health and Social Security which warned on 21 March that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> paying Housing Benefit to the council if no rate was made. The council felt sufficiently concerned to avoid budget chaos that it set up a special resources sub-committee to agree emergency measures for ordering supplies. On 25 March the Mayor summoned a special council meeting for 28 March, while senior councillors discussed options with the borough solicitor. The meeting on 28 March saw prolonged disruption from the public gallery by those who supported continued defiance, and Mayor Harry Garrett called on the police to keep order. Among the councillors the decision was taken to approve a legal rate of 196.65p; a council spokesman claimed that the council would be going ahead with what it was going to do anyway.|$|E

The United States also applied their military segregation policies to the native Puerto Ricans. Puerto Ricans of African descent were assigned to all black units such as the 375th Regiment. Puerto Ricans were to be sent to North Carolina to train for deployment overseas, however Senators from the southeastern states opposed and foiled these plans, citing that Puerto Ricans <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> to the laws and customs of the racist Jim Crow policies. Southern politicians were alarmed of the idea of having armed African-Americans in the south and believed that Puerto Ricans of mixed race, who did not understand their racial policies, would only add to their problems.

Further down the field, Cassidy got ahead of Merhi to move into fifth. Blomqvist resisted an overtaking manoevure from Ocon to keep third position, while Latifi retook seventh from King and Coletti lost ninth to Serrallés. Rosenqvist quickly built up a one and a half second lead over teammate Auer who was able to reduce the gap to nine-tenths of a second, but Rosenqvist maintained the lead {{for the rest of the}} qualifying race to win and claim the pole position for the Grand Prix itself. Blomqvist fended off further attacks from Ocon to clinch third with Cassidy fifth and Merhi sixth. Behind the trio, Latifi followed in seventh with King eighth and Serrallés ninth. Coletti rounded out the top ten finishers. Outside the top ten, Fuoco took eleventh ahead of Ferrucci, with the Japanese duo of Kanamaru, Yamashita in the next two places. Menezes, Calderón, Cao, Goddard, Pommer, Takaboshi, Chang and Wells rounded out the classified finishers. Buller finished but was not classified as he was two laps behind the winner.|$|E
