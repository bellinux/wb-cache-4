50|$|Evans was {{a native}} of Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales. His father {{abandoned}} the family in 1924 shortly before Evans's birth. Evans had an older sister, Eileen, and a younger half-sister, Maureen, who was born after Evans's mother remarried in 1929. As a child, Evans had difficulty learning to speak and struggled at school. Following an accident when he was eight, Evans developed a tubercular verruca on his right foot that never completely healed and caused him to miss considerable amounts of time from school for treatments, further setting back his education. Although some authors have claimed Evans was, as an adult, unable to read or to write anything beyond his name, he is known to have avidly read comics and to have understood the writing upon the <b>wage</b> <b>packets</b> and the receipts he handled on a daily basis in his job, thus making such claims unreliable.|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the construction industry workforce have a propensity to experience ‘camaraderie’ during their working day. The mutual trust between these blue-collar workers, associated with camaraderie, can cement a lasting bond between colleagues. This foundation of trust can manifest itself in behaviour that can lead to the establishment of group norms that can have both a positive and negative impact on productivity levels within a project i. e. the practice of ‘soldiering’, as exposed by Frederick Taylor almost a century ago continues to be practiced by construction operatives seeking overtime to boost their <b>wage</b> <b>packets.</b> Conversely, the hostile conditions often associated with construction projects can bond colleagues together in adversity against either the management and /or the task at hand and may have an influence on both personal and project performance. This paper seeks to uncover the variables associated with camaraderie amongst blue-collar construction workers by providing insights that will inform the next phase of the project...|$|R
40|$|Looking back in {{time from}} a {{distance}} of two decades, we are apt to forget the economic circumstances in which the nationwide protests of 1989 arose, as well as the vantage points of the protests’ participants. In the late 1980 s, people across China felt frustrated and angered by inflation and mounting corruption. This dissatisfaction had been moving toward a crisis point over the previous couple of years despite the fact that urban living standards, on the whole, had been rising steadily throughout most of the Eighties. But expectations of a better life had been rising even faster, and when inflation in 1988 began to overtake wage rises in the state sector, frustrations sharpened. Workers who had been willing to countenance the corruption of officials when their own <b>wage</b> <b>packets</b> were growing healthily became resentful in 1988 and 1999 when they saw that the close kin of officials were cutting themselves an undue share of the pie while their own slices shrank. What held the protesters together was the very fact that theirs was a protestmovement, without a clear platform. Had there been one, far fewer people might have participated – for the solutions to China’s economic ailments favored by different groups among the protesters were very much at variance. Some of the protesters who came into the streets – in particular the leading intellectuals and most of the students – wanted the economic reforms to proceed faster. Others among the protesters contrarily had discovered that the economic reforms had not been to their advantage: particularly those in the working class whose incomes were declining, and those whose jobs were no longer secure or who had already been laid off. Only a fragile unity was pasted together among these groups. The better educated had little sympathy for the circumstances of the laborers, and for much of the time the university students sought to keep the working class at arms’ length, preventing workers from entering the perimeters of their own demonstrations...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports the}} first cross-national {{evaluation}} of the prevalence of a little discussed wage arrangement where formal employers pay their formal employees two wages, one declared and the other an undeclared ‘envelope wage’. Analysing {{the results of a}} 2007 survey conducted in the 27 European Union member states, the finding is that some 5 % of employees in formal employment receive an additional undeclared wage from their formal employer which amounts on average to some two-fifths of their <b>wage</b> <b>packet.</b> However, this employment practice is found to be markedly more prevalent in East-Central European countries, where some 11 % of formal employees receive an undeclared wage and this is more often paid for their regular employment hours, which is in stark contrast to Continental Europe and Nordic countries, where such wages are less common and received mostly for overtime or extra work performed. The article concludes by discussing how this neglected but nevertheless significant practice might be tackled. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reveals that}} formal labour {{markets in the}} European Union are not always quite as pure, whole-some and {{legitimate}} as might be supposed. Until now, it has been commonly assumed that the formal economy is separate and discrete from the informal economy. To contribute to the emerging literature showing {{that this is not}} always the case and that the formal economy can be permeated by informal prac-tices, a so far little discussed employment arrange-ment is here brought to the fore in which formal employers pay their formal employees two wages, one declared and the other an undeclared (‘enve-lope’) wage. Reporting a 2007 survey composed of 26, 659 face-to-face interviews in the 27 EU member states, the finding is that some 5 percent of all formal employees receive such undeclared wages from their formal employers which amount on average to two-fifths of their <b>wage</b> <b>packet.</b> However, this employ-ment practice is not evenly distributed across the EU. Such quasi-formal employment is markedly more prevalent in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), where the undeclared wage {{is more likely to be}} paid for regular employment hours, while in Continental Europe and Nordic countries undeclared wages are less common and are received mostly for overtime or extra work conducted. Given the prevalence in the EU of this hybrid employment practice which is neither purely formal nor informal, the article con-cludes by calling for greater recognition of how for-mal and informal employment are sometimes intimately interlocked and entwined rather than sep-arate and discrete spheres...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} in the Baltic Sea region the prevalence of an illegitimate wage arrangement whereby formal employers pay their formal employees both an official declared wage as well as a supplementary undeclared (envelope) wage. Design/methodology/approach - A 2007 Eurobarometer survey is reported that evaluates envelope wage practices in 27 European Union (EU) member states. This paper focuses upon the 4, 031 face-to-face interviews conducted in four countries from the Baltic Sea region that are now member states of the EU, namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Findings - Some one in eight formal employees in these four countries from the Baltic Sea region received an undeclared "envelope" wage from their formal employer during the past 12 months which on average amounted to 45 per cent of their gross <b>wage</b> <b>packet.</b> Although this practice is concentrated in smaller businesses, the construction industry, and amongst younger people, manual workers and lower income groups in these four countries, it is by no means confined to specific pockets of the economic landscape. Rather, it exists throughout these countries in all business types and employee groups. Research limitations/implications - The existence and commonality of envelope wages reveals the need to transcend the dichotomous depiction of formal and informal jobs as always separate and discrete and to recognise how they can be inextricably interwoven. Practical implications - This paper outlines a range of potential policy measures for tack-ling envelope wages and calls for their piloting and evaluation. Originality/value - The first cross-national evaluation of the incidence and nature of envelope wages in the Baltic Sea region and what needs to be done to tackle this practice. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades the {{institutional}} structures across the OECD countries have changed dramatically, having a significant impact on labour market performance. This thesis seeks to make four contributions {{to our understanding of the}} implications and applications of regulations. This is done in two distinct ways: firstly, to focus on a specific policy change in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, and secondly, to analyse (more generally) the disparities in policies across the OECD countries, in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. Chapter 1 seeks to contribute to the literature on tax credit policies, which have been a popular way to alleviate in-work poverty. The assumption is typically that the incidence is on the claimant workers. However, economic theory suggests no particular reason to believe that this should be the case. This chapter investigates the incidence of the Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) in the UK introduced in 1999, which unlike similar tax credit policies was paid through the <b>wage</b> <b>packet,</b> increasing the connection between the employer and worker with regard to the tax credit. Using two stage parametric and non-parametric censored regression methods I find compelling evidence to suggest that the firm discriminates by cutting the wage of claimant workers relative to similarly skilled non-claimant workers when looking at men and that there is a spill-over effect onto the wage for both men and women. Chapter 2 then goes on to look more closely at the acclaimed relationship between tax credits and labour supply. One of the principle aims of the WFTC was to increase the participation of those with low labour market attachment. The literature to date concludes that for lone mothers there was approximately a 5 % point increase in employment. The differences-in-differences methodology that is typically used compare lone mother with single women without children. However, the characteristics of these groups are both observably and unobservably different, such that the identifying assumption may not be satisfied. I find that when I control for differential trends between people with and without children, the employment effect of WFTC falls significantly. Moreover, by looking at movements in the hour's distribution, it is clear that any WFTC effect is solely borne on those working full-time (30 hours or more). Another concern is that I find that the policy did not induce people into the labour market from inactivity. Chapter 3 seeks to explain why it is that in some OECD countries the male and female unemployment rates are very similar but in others (notably the 'Mediterranean' countries) the female unemployment rate is much higher than the male. The analysis shows that, in countries where there is a large gender gap in unemployment rates, there is a gender gap in both flows from employment into unemployment and from unemployment into employment. Overall it seems that differences in human capital accumulation between men and women interacted with labour market institutions is an important part of the explanation. Chapter 4 looks at how the labour's share of GDP in many OECD countries has declined over {{the last two}} decades. The little evidence that exists on this important issue is almost entirely macro-economic. This chapter uses cross-country panel data evidence from a group of 'network industries', where there have been substantial changes of public ownership and entry barrier. The results show that privatisation can explain a significant proportion of the fall of labour's share in these industries, even when the endogeneity of the policy rules is accounted for using sociopolitical instrumental variables. The impact of privatisation has been somewhat offset by falling barriers which dampen profit margins...|$|E
