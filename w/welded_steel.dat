5|$|The {{durability}} and life of dynamically loaded, <b>welded</b> <b>steel</b> structures is determined {{in many cases}} by the welds, in particular the weld transitions.

5|$|The Winslow Ames House is a {{prefabricated}} modular International Style {{house in}} New London, Connecticut, United States. It {{was designed by}} Robert W. McLaughlin, Jr. and was built in 1933. Winslow Ames, a professor of art history at Connecticut College and the art director of the Lyman Allyn Museum, had the home built after attending the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Constructed for $7,500, the prefabricated house {{is one of two}} surviving Motohomes produced by McLaughlin's company American Houses Inc. The modular house, comprising three rectangles and a flat roof, was constructed on a concrete slab with a <b>welded</b> <b>steel</b> framework. It was made with asbestos panels and features a core component that provides the heating and plumbing functions for the house. The other two modules feature two bedrooms and a one-car garage.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hydrogen}} on the fracture toughness properties of upset welded Type 304 L stainless steel were measured and {{compared to those}} measured previously for as-received and as-welded steels. The {{results showed that the}} upset <b>welded</b> <b>steels</b> had good fracture toughness properties, but values were lower than the as-received material. The fracture toughness value of the base material was 6420 in-lbs/sq. in., while the <b>welded</b> <b>steels</b> averaged 3660 in-lbs/sq. in. Hydrogen exposure lowered the fracture toughness values of the as-received steel by 43 % to 3670 in-lbs/sq. in. and the <b>welded</b> <b>steels</b> by 21 % to 2890 in-lbs/sq. in. The fracture morphologies of the unexposed steels showed that ductile fracture occurred by the microvoid nucleation and growth process. The size of the microvoids on the fracture surfaces of the <b>welded</b> <b>steels</b> were much smaller and more closely spaced that those found on the base material fracture surfaces. The change in the size and spacing of the microvoids indicates that the fracture toughness properties of the <b>welded</b> <b>steels</b> were lower than the base steels because of the higher concentration of microscopic precipitates on the weld plane. The welds examined thus far have been {open_quotes}good{close_quotes} welds and the presence of these precipitates was not apparent in standard {open_quotes}low{close_quotes}-magnification metallographic sections of the weld planes. The results indicate that hydrogen did not weaken greatly the solid-state welds but that other inclusions or impurities present prior to welding did. Improvements in surface cleaning and preparation prior to welding should be explored as a way to improve the strength of solid-state welded joints...|$|R

50|$|The MAPP/oxygen flame is {{not entirely}} {{appropriate}} for <b>welding</b> <b>steel,</b> due to the high concentration of hydrogen in the flame - higher than acetylene, but lower {{than any of the}} other petroleum fuel gases. The hydrogen infuses into the molten steel and renders the welds brittle. For small-scale welding with MAPP this is not a serious problem, as the hydrogen escapes readily, and MAPP/oxygen can in practice be used for <b>welding</b> small <b>steel</b> parts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Creep {{strength}} of high Cr ferritic <b>steel</b> <b>welds</b> decreases than base metals due to Type-IV creep damages {{formed in the}} heat affected zone (HAZ) during long-term use at elevated temperatures. In the present study, microstructural changes and damage evolution behaviors in HAZ during creep were investigated for the ASME Gr. 91 and Gr. 122 <b>steel</b> <b>weld</b> joints. Creep voids formed {{at an early stage}} of life and coalesced to form a macro crack at 0. 8 of life for the Gr. 91 <b>steel</b> <b>weld.</b> On the other hand, for the high strengthened Gr. 122 <b>steel</b> <b>weld,</b> small amounts of Type-IV creep voids formed at 0. 5 of life, increased slightly until 0. 9 of life and rapid crack growth occurred after that. KAM and grain boundary length of fine-grained HAZ obtained by EBSD decreased and saturated till 0. 2 of life in the Gr. 91 <b>steel</b> <b>weld,</b> whereas they decreased after 0. 5 of life in the Gr. 122 <b>steel</b> <b>weld.</b> It was found that the recovery of dislocation structures in HAZ was completed at early stage of life for the Gr. 91 <b>steel</b> <b>weld,</b> whereas it occurred after recrystallization at the later stage of life for the Gr. 122 <b>steel</b> <b>weld.</b> These differences of microstructural changes was considered to relate to the differences of Type-IV creep damage behavior; early initiation of creep voids at 0. 2 of life in the Gr. 91 <b>steel</b> <b>weld</b> and later damage evolution after 0. 5 of life in the Gr. 122 <b>steel</b> <b>weld.</b> From these results the methods for remaining life assessment of high Cr <b>steel</b> <b>welds</b> were discussed...|$|R
