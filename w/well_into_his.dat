5|$|Holloway {{continued}} to perform until <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eighties, touring Asia and Australia in 1977 together with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and David Langton in The Pleasure of His Company, by Samuel A. Taylor and Cornelia Otis Skinner. He made his last appearance performing at the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium in 1980, aged 89.|$|E
5|$|As {{territorial}} {{governor of}} Montana, Leslie quickly drew {{the ire of}} the press for his pro-temperance position. The territory's political machinery also turned against him, and he was removed from office by President Benjamin Harrison. When Grover Cleveland succeeded Harrison {{for a second term}} in office, he appointed Leslie district attorney for Montana. Leslie continued to practice law <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eighties, and was being considered for a district court judgeship in Montana when he fell ill with pneumonia and died on February 7, 1907, at the age of 87.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was in {{good health}} {{for most of his}} life. He {{retained}} a private pilot's license <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> 80s, eventually quitting flying {{when he and his wife}} found it too difficult to get into the cockpit due to knee problems. In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful heart valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. In early December 2016, he was hospitalized at the James Cancer Hospital of Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. According to a family source, Glenn had been in declining health, and his condition was grave; his wife and their children and grandchildren were at the hospital.|$|E
6000|$|The man choked and stammered, and then, as tears <b>welled</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{he found}} {{the use of his}} tongue and cursed. No gentle speech could ever have equaled that curse in eloquent {{expression}} of what he felt for Jane Withersteen. How strangely his look and tone reminded her of Lassiter! ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{finished}} {{his career at}} the Chelsea Football Club in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League and played <b>well</b> <b>into</b> in <b>his</b> 30s. A three time [...] "Best and Fairest" [...] winner, Bowey retired after Chelsea's 2006 Grand Final win.|$|R
5000|$|Frederic Franklin —became {{director}} of the National Ballet of Washington, D.C. Advised Dance Theatre of Harlem, as <b>well</b> as performing <b>into</b> <b>his</b> nineties.|$|R
5|$|Pony Bob {{continued}} {{to work as a}} rider for Wells Fargo and Company after the Civil War, scouted for the U.S. Army <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> fifties, and later accompanied his good friend Buffalo Bill Cody on a diplomatic mission to negotiate the surrender of Chief Sitting Bull in December 1890. He drifted in and out of public mention but eventually died in Chicago during the winter of 1912 (age 72) in deep poverty after suffering a stroke. Buffalo Bill paid for his friend's headstone at Mount Greenwood Cemetery (111 Street and Sacramento) on Chicago's far south side.|$|E
5|$|Off-stage, Robey led {{an active}} {{lifestyle}} {{and was a}} keen amateur sportsman. He {{was proud of his}} healthy physique and maintained it by performing frequent exercise and following a careful diet. By the time he was in his mid-thirties, he had played as an amateur against Millwall, Chelsea and Fulham football clubs. He organised and played in many charity football matches throughout England, which were described by the sporting press as being of a very high standard, and he remained an active football player <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> fifties. Robey became associated with cricket by 1895 when he led a team of amateur players for a match at Turney Road in Dulwich. In September 1904, while appearing in Hull, he was asked by the cricketer Harry Wrathall {{to take part in a}} charity cricket match at the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Robey played so well that Wrathall asked him to return the following Saturday to take part in a professional game. That weekend, while waiting in the pavilion before the game, Robey was approached by an agent for Hull City A.F.C., who asked the comedian to play in a match that same afternoon. Robey agreed, swapped his cricket flannels for a football kit and played with the team against Nottingham Forest as an inside right.|$|E
25|$|In the book, he {{discussed}} how he maintained his health and activeness <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> advanced age.|$|E
6000|$|The Doctor looked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> old friend's face, and {{the tears}} <b>welled</b> up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eyes. [...] "He died as he lived," [...] he said to himself, [...] "forgiving as he also would be forgiven. Dear old friend, we have spent many a happy hour together; yet, dying as you died, how can I grieve for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The tears had <b>welled</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eyes again, and {{he hurried}} away. Lucilla had faith (or rather acquiescence) without feeling. Feeling without faith {{was a mystery}} to her. How much Owen {{believed}} or disbelieved she knew not, probably he could not himself have told. It was more uncertainty than denial, rather dislike to technical dogma than positive unbelief; and yet, with his predilections all {{on the side of}} faith, she could not, womanlike, understand why they did not bring his reason with them. After all, she decided, in her off-hand fashion, that there was quite enough that was distressing and perplexing without concerning herself about them! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{jealous of}} {{everything}} whose beauty does not die. I am {{jealous of the}} portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me, and gives something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day--mock me horribly!" [...] The hot tears <b>welled</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging himself on the divan, he {{buried his face in}} the cushions, as though he was praying.|$|R
25|$|Little {{is known}} about Solomon's mother, except that she looked after her husband <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> old age.|$|E
25|$|He {{was already}} <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> 30s {{when he played}} in Bangladesh's inaugural match. He {{finished}} his short Test career with a moderate average of 16.18. His highest, 44, came against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2001.|$|E
25|$|A {{large part}} of his working life was spent as a public servant with the Australian Taxation Department. He was a {{friendly}} man and very sociable {{both on and off}} the field. His cricket life continued <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> seventies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Well</b> along <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{criminal}} career, he {{was arrested}} in Scotland and charged with blowing up the safe of the headquarters of the Edinburgh Co-operative Society. Let out on bail, he fled to Jersey in the Channel Islands, where he unsuccessfully attempted to continue his criminal career.|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} writing, <b>Wells</b> incorporated <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{discussions of the}} World State a notion of universal human rights that would protect and guarantee {{the freedom of the}} individual. His 1940 publication The Rights of Man laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|R

25|$|He {{continued}} to play club cricket in Halifax until he was <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> forties. In 1922, he had an operation to remove some cancer, but it acted only to prolong his life. He died on 12 September 1925 in Halifax.|$|E
25|$|He was the {{official}} vet to Dublin Zoo for 25 years {{and later became}} its president. Ham retired officially from veterinary practice in 1979 {{at the age of}} 69, but was still seeing cases privately at his home <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> nineties.|$|E
25|$|Pitcairn {{remained}} quite {{active in}} his numerous business, philanthropy, and social activism capacities <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> seventies. Finally, {{in the fall}} of 1915, he suffered a bout of pneumonia, from which he never fully recovered. He died at Cairnwood on July 22, 1916.|$|E
50|$|Hallam {{is still}} a very active researcher, {{undertaking}} fieldtrips and attending conferences <b>well</b> <b>into</b> retirement. In <b>his</b> spare time he enjoys watching football, the arts, cinema and travel.|$|R
50|$|He {{loved to}} {{introduce}} historically <b>well</b> known persons <b>into</b> <b>his</b> operettas; Kaiser Joseph II in Die Försterchristl, Prince Eugene of Savoy in Jungfer Sonnenschein, Joseph Haydn in Das Musikantenmädel.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the morning}} I sought out Seppi and told him. It was {{down by the}} river. His lips moved, {{but he did not}} say anything, he only looked dazed and stunned, and his face turned very white. He stood like that a few moments, the tears <b>welling</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eyes, then he turned away and I locked my arm in his and we walked along thinking, but not speaking. We crossed the bridge and wandered through the meadows and up among the hills and the woods, and at last the talk came and flowed freely, and it was all about Nikolaus and was a recalling of the life we had lived with him. And every now and then Seppi said, as if to himself: ...|$|R
25|$|Dayan Fisher {{moved with}} his wife to Edgware in the 1970s, where they became {{well-known}} and popular figures. His wife's death in 1987 was a severe blow, yet he continued to speak and teach {{for the next decade}} and a half, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> 90s.|$|E
25|$|Rice played cricket, as a medium-pace bowler and lower-order batsman, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> fifties. Aside from club cricket {{he played}} {{numerous}} {{games for the}} Royal Navy, two non-first-class matches for Sussex in 1945, and one match in 1946 for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship.|$|E
25|$|Flohr {{settled in}} Prague, {{gradually}} acquiring {{a reputation as}} a skilled chessplayer by playing for stakes in the city's many cafés. During 1924, he participated in simultaneous exhibitions by Richard Réti and Rudolf Spielmann, and he was still giving displays <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> seventies.|$|E
60|$|Not a {{word was}} spoken. With an {{expression}} of tender compassion Mr. <b>Wells</b> received her <b>into</b> <b>his</b> arms. The four missionaries turned fearful, questioning eyes upon the hunter, {{but they could not}} speak.|$|R
5|$|Maxwell's parents met {{and married}} when they were <b>well</b> <b>into</b> their thirties; <b>his</b> mother was nearly 40 when he was born. They had had one earlier child, a {{daughter}} named Elizabeth, who died in infancy.|$|R
60|$|Barnaby, who {{had been}} {{sleeping}} on the grass, sprung up quickly at the sound; and Grip, who appeared to understand it equally <b>well,</b> walked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> basket straightway, entreating society in general (as though he intended a kind of satire upon them in connection with churchyards) never to say die on any terms. They were soon on the coach-top and rolling along the road.|$|R
25|$|Brod had {{a strong}} {{interest}} in boating, and sailed <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> 80s. He owned a boatyard on City Island in the Bronx, and also owned a boat production factory in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. He was married (and subsequently divorced) three times, and was survived by two sons and two daughters, and three grandchildren.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} years {{he worked for a}} textile company, before setting up an {{insurance}} brokers company with his wife Doris, who was the brother of Lancashire cricketer and professional footballer Jim Cumbes. He continued to coach cricket <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> final years, advising schools and clubs in the Manchester area. He died suddenly on 5 November 2009.|$|E
25|$|He {{then became}} master {{in charge of}} rugby at Cheltenham College in 1966 and subsequently, to cope with {{timetable}} clashes, he moved to Bristol Rugby. In the 1980s he retired from teaching and became landlord of the Seven Stars pub in Stithians, still turning out <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> fifties for the local rugby club.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sa-a-c-r-r-r-e," [...] muttered Raoul {{between his}} teeth; [...] "Etooell, if an Englishman, he may very <b>well</b> take it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> head {{to come in}} here, and perhaps anchor within half-a-cable's length of us! What think you of that, mon brave Américain?" ...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the famous}} {{consequences}} {{of the events of}} May 1968 in France was the decentralization and extension of the university. Between 1969 and 1971, Mitxelena taught comparative Basque linguistics at the Sorbonne as professeur associé and chargé de cours in the École Pratique des Hautes Études. The friendship Mitxelena had with André Martinet at this time should be mentioned. At the beginning, he would often visit Martinet's house, and he eventually entered <b>into</b> <b>his</b> circle of friends and scientists, as <b>well</b> as <b>into</b> <b>his</b> publishing network.|$|R
6000|$|... "My master says," [...] was the answer, [...] "he {{thinks that}} all who see her {{will have need}} of her, since such loveliness is rare. But if you wish a name, <b>well,</b> one comes <b>into</b> <b>his</b> mind; {{the name of the}} knight Lozelle." ...|$|R
