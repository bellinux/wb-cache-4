40|$|Two sets of movable <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> {{with spring}} {{mechanism}} for hand tractors {{have been designed}} and tested. The wheels were set on local hand tractors and tested for tilling paddy fields in Cianjur and Subang districts, West Java. A local fixed <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> was also tested in each location. The movable <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> for Cianjur location was equipped {{with a pair of}} coiled type torsion springs on each lug, while the movable <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> for Subang location was equipped with a shaft type torsion spring on each lug. Field performances: theoretical and actual field capacities, wheel slip, and wheel shrinkage, were measured during the test. The test result in Cianjur showed that the movable <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> had a better traction performance than the fixed <b>lug</b> <b>wheel.</b> The average wheel slip of the movable <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> was 11. 54 %, while the average wheel slip of the fixed <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> was 20. 89 %. Field efficiency of the movable <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> was 76. 33 %, which was bigger than the fixed <b>lug</b> <b>wheel</b> (68. 45 %). However, the test result using shaft type torsion springs in Subang showed that the spring mechanism did not work well, and the spring mechanism should be modified on its torsion-shaft diameter and welding strength.

50|$|Rarely, {{and more}} often with large trucks and lorries, {{insufficient}} force {{can lead to the}} nuts coming undone while in use. Because of this, it is best to use a torque wrench or similar tool to finally tighten the <b>wheel</b> <b>lug</b> nuts to the proper torque specification as soon as possible after using a lug wrench to affix a wheel. At the very least, the lug nuts should be checked for tightness after 50-100 km/miles when things have been subject to some vibration and thermal cycling.|$|E

50|$|A center cap, or centercap is a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers a central {{portion of the}} wheel. Early center caps for automobiles were small and primarily served the purpose of keeping dirt away from the spindle nut and wheel bearings of vehicles.

5000|$|Thailand was {{the last}} plant to start {{assembling}} Ford Fiesta for ASEAN countries. A 6-speed Powershift dual-clutch transmission was made available as standard transmission initially for the 1.6L Ti-VCT engines in 2011 and 2012 in Thailand, and currently also for the 1.5 Ti-VCT variant (officially from March 2012 onwards). Curiously, the Thai-made Fiesta versions - both saloon and five-door hatch - feature a 100 mm pitch circle diameter (PCD) <b>wheel</b> <b>lug</b> mount measurement identical to the Mazda2, {{as opposed to the}} 108 mm one as found in other global versions.

40|$|A common {{issue with}} Toyota pickups from the 1980 ’s is the factory braking {{system is not}} {{responsive}} enough for the driver to properly brake during an emergency situation. The cause of the poor response in braking comes from the drum brakes {{that are on the}} rear of the vehicle. Aftermarket vendors offered disc brake conversions that change the brakes on the rear axle from drum to disc. The aftermarket brackets that are in the conversion are thick and bulky adding excess weight to the already heavy pickup. These thick brackets in the conversion do not retain the factory emergency brake which is required to maintain proper functionality. To remedy the issue, a set of brackets were designed around the use of Ford Mustang calipers and Mitsubishi Montero rotors in order to retain the factory emergency brake and to maintain the correct <b>wheel</b> <b>lug</b> pattern. In order to reduce the bulk of the brackets, stress analysis was performed on the bracket design to find the minimum allowable thickness. This was performed over multiple materials to use different thicknesses. Once a thickness was calculated for each material, it was reevaluated to ensure that the brackets would not deflect more than what the tolerance allowed. With brackets designed and built, they will be tested on the test vehicle where the deflection of the bracket will be recorded and compared to the. 005 ” tolerance. The calculations that were performed prove the vehicle will safely stop in the specified distance of 75 ft. from 40 mph. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduced}} a testbed developed from a perspective of soil mechanics {{which not only}} focused on wheel design and optimization but also considered {{the elimination of the}} boundary effect caused by soil bin. Using this testbed, a series of experimental investigations were performed by changing the wheel rotational velocity, vertical load and towed load. Tracks were generated at a regular spacing as the <b>wheel</b> <b>lugs</b> enter and exit the soil periodically. It has been found that there is a relationship between the track length and wheel slip ratio regardless of different mechanical properties of soil. The wheel rotational velocity has little effect on the driving torque and sinkage. The towed load affects more on the driving torque than on the sinkage. However, the vertical load effects on the driving torque and sinkage are similar. The current models used for parameter estimations may not be appropriate for TJ- 1 lunar soil simulant which has a relatively high internal friction angle according to the experimental results. But the internal friction angle and cohesion can still be estimated with proper selection of shear deformation modulus using the model proposed by Li et al(2011) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{performance}} of a <b>lugged</b> <b>wheel</b> for a lunar micro rover on sloped terrain by a 2 D discrete element method (DEM), which was initially developed for horizontal terrain. To confirm the applicability of DEM for sloped terrain locomotion, the relationships of slope angle with slip, wheel sinkage and wheel torque obtained by DEM, were compared with experimental results measured using a slope test bed consisting of a soil bin filled with lunar regolith simulant. Among the lug parameters investigated, a <b>lugged</b> <b>wheel</b> with rim diameter of 250 mm, width of 100 mm, lug height of 10 mm, lug thickness of 5 mm, and total lug number of 18 was found, on average, to perform excellently in terms of metrics, such as slope angle for 20 % slip, power number for self-propelled point, power number for 15 -degree slope and power number for 20 % slip. The estimation of wheel performance over sloped lunar terrain showed an increase in wheel slip, and the possibility exists that the selected <b>lugged</b> <b>wheel</b> will not be able to move up a slope steeper than 20 °...|$|R
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of the Moon and Mars are covered with loose soil. In such conditions, planetary rovers can get stuck and even cause failure of an exploration mission. To avoid such problems, the wheels of planetary rovers typically have lugs (i. e., grousers) on their surface, which substantially improve their traveling performance. However, there exists no theoretical method to determine a suitable lug interval. In this study, we first modeled the linear traveling speed of a <b>wheel</b> with <b>lugs</b> and provided guidelines for determining a suitable lug interval, {{as well as the}} corresponding terramechanical stress models. Next, to verify the suitable interval for lugs, we performed traveling tests using a two-wheeled rover with wheels having different numbers of lugs of different heights. According to the experimental results, when a <b>wheel</b> has three <b>lugs</b> in a range where normal stress is generated beneath it, it can travel with constant speed while the traveling performance is substantially improved...|$|R

50|$|Ideally, {{the nuts}} (or bolts) should be {{tightened}} with a torque wrench. Lug wrenches {{are much less}} expensive because they lack the ability to measure or limit the force used. Installing a <b>wheel</b> with a <b>lug</b> wrench thus requires a bit of rough guessing about proper tightness. Excessive force can strip threads or make the nuts very difficult to remove. Also, uneven torque between the various lug nuts, or excessive torque, can lead to warping of the brake rotor if the car is equipped with disc brakes. For this reason, impact wrenches should properly be used only for removing lug nuts, not for tightening them, although in practice this rule is often ignored for convenience's sake, even by professional mechanics.|$|R
