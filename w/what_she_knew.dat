25|$|The wealthy socialite Helen Brach {{was a human}} victim. Brach was {{a millionaire}} candy company heiress and animal lover who {{vanished}} in 1977 {{at the age of}} 65. While her body was never found, she was declared dead in 1984. Investigators suspected that she was murdered because she threatened to reveal <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> about the over-valuing of horses, which would have led authorities to the string of horse killings perpetrated by Richard Bailey, a man who was later indicted for a role in her murder.|$|E
25|$|Sánchez overheard the {{conversation}} and told her sisters what she heard. She {{decided that it was}} of utmost importance to notify Captain John Jackson Dickison, commander of the Confederate force the 2nd Florida Cavalry in Camp Davis, just {{a mile and a half}} from her home. Her sisters agreed to help by covering up her absence. Panchita entertained the troops while Eugenia prepared supper with the supposed help of Lola. Sánchez left her house that night and traveled, through the forest, alone on horseback. When she reached the ferry, the ferryman agreed to mind her horse while she crossed the river. After crossing the river she came upon a Confederate picket and told him what she heard, but the picket was unable to leave his post and lent her his horse. She then proceeded to the camp where she met with Capt. Dickison and told him <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> She then returned home, the whole event took an hour and a half, and her absence went unnoticed by the Union soldiers.|$|E

500|$|Records of Olivia's life resume through Dorothy's {{letters and}} diaries {{surrounding}} {{the arrival of}} the American poet Ezra Pound in London in 1909. Following her friends in Kensington society, Olivia opened her home once a week for a salon, beginning an important period in her life. When Yeats returned to London that year, Olivia became the centre of a blossoming literary movement. Yeats held a Monday evening salon; those who attended usually also visited Olivia's. She hosted, and became a nexus for, much of the pre-war literary activity in London. Notable attendees included Pound, Hilda Doolitle, Yeats, Wyndham Lewis, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Walter Morse Rummel, Richard Aldington, William Carlos Williams, T. E. Hulme and John Cournos. The gatherings were held in her drawing room, a place Pound described in a letter as [...] "full of white magic". Olivia was by now a well-known occultist and hosted séances in her drawing room. She became well-versed in astrology and palmistry, passing on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> to Dorothy who shared her interest. Both read grimoires; Olivia was an expert at [...] "drawing occult symbols" [...] and quite familiar with the symbology of the occult.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after her}} arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her—commenting that [...] "a little birdie" [...] {{had told him}} that she was in town—and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. [...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next month}} {{she was called}} into her supervisor's supervisor's office, and told {{to go to an}} {{employee}} counseling service, an act she knew to be punitive, [...] "because you look stressed".

When asked about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> about the duchess' strange death, Filastre panicked and admitted that Montespan hired her to perform the murder on Fontanges. [...] Montespan wished death on her young rival so she could regain {{the love of the}} king. Later Filastre said about her statements: [...] "All I said is false. I did that for me to be free of pain and torment. I say all this because I do not want to kill the guilty conscience of a lie." [...] however she was executed by burning in Paris after Marguerite Monvoisin accused her of a child sacrifice. Though many believed the Duchess was indeed poisoned by Madame de Montespan, the evidence by the witnesses whom later denied every statements from them as false made it impossible for the court to determine Montespan as the actual murderer.|$|E
