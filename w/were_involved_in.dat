5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals <b>were</b> <b>involved.</b> <b>In</b> 2005 beagles <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black market}} was extremely expensive.

40|$|Our {{work has}} {{suggested}} that a high-frequency event <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the initiation phase of malignant transformation in vitro; a later, mutationlike event appears to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the later stages of transformation. There may be no specific "target gene" which directly interacts with carcinogens. It is hypothesized that nonspecific types of DNA damage <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the induction of an ongoing process we know as carcinogenesis. Several genes could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining this process. Our recent results suggest that c-myc and c-fos could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{the early stages of}} carcinogenesis, as they are affected by anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors in a manner that corresponds {{to the way in which}} protease inhibitors suppress malignant transformation...|$|R
