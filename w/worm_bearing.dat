40|$|We {{recently}} reported a genome-wide screen for extended stationary phase survival in Escherichia coli. One of the mutants recovered is deleted for ubiG, which encodes a methyltransferase {{required for the}} biosynthesis of ubiquinone. The ubiG mutant exhibits longer lifespan, as well as enhanced resistance to thermal and oxidative stress compared to wt at extracellular pH 9. The longevity of the mutant, {{as well as its}} resistance to the superoxide-generating agent paraquat, is partially dependent on the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ArcA. A microarray analysis revealed several genes whose expression is either suppressed or enhanced by ArcA in the ubiG mutant. TdcA is a transcription factor involved in the transport and metabolism of amino acids during anaerobic growth. Its enhanced expression in the ubiG mutant is dependent on ArcA. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that ArcA and TdcA function in the same genetic pathway to increase lifespan and enhance oxidative stress resistance in the ubiG mutant. Our results might be relevant for the elucidation of the mechanism of lifespan extension in mutant mice and <b>worms</b> <b>bearing</b> mutations in ubiquinone biosynthetic genes...|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{characterize}} a new K+ channel–kinase {{complex that}} operates in the metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans to control learning behaviour. This channel {{is composed of}} a pore-forming subunit, dubbed KHT- 1 (73 % homology to human Kv 3. 1), and the accessory subunit MPS- 1, which shows kinase activity. Genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological evidence show that KHT- 1 and MPS- 1 form a complex in vitro and in native mechanosensory PLM neurons, and that KHT- 1 is a substrate for the kinase activity of MPS- 1. Behavioural analysis further shows that the kinase activity of MPS- 1 is specifically required for habituation to repetitive mechanical stimulation. Thus, <b>worms</b> <b>bearing</b> an inactive MPS- 1 variant (D 178 N) respond normally to touch on the body but do not habituate to repetitive mechanical stimulation such as tapping {{on the side of}} the Petri dish. Hence, the phosphorylation status of KHT- 1 –MPS- 1 seems to be linked to distinct behavioural responses. In the non-phosphorylated state the channel is necessary for the normal function of the touch neurons. In the auto-phosphorylated state the channel acts to induce neuronal adaptation to mechanical stimulation. Taken together, these data establish a new mechanism of dynamic regulation of electrical signalling in the nervous system...|$|R
40|$|The great {{majority}} of lifespan-augmenting mutations were discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, genetic disruption of insulin-like signaling extends longevity 1. 5 - to 3 -fold in the nematode, and to lesser degrees in other taxa, including fruit flies and mice. C. elegans strains bearing homozygous nonsense mutations in the age- 1 gene, which encodes the class-I phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase catalytic subunit (PI 3 K CS), produce progeny that were thought to undergo obligatory developmental arrest. We now find that, after prolonged developmental times at 15 – 20 °C, they mature into extremely long-lived adults with near-normal feeding rates and motility. They survive to a median of 145 – 190 days at 20 °C, with nearly 10 -fold extension of both median and maximum adult lifespan relative to N 2 DRM, a long-lived wild-type stock into which the null mutant was outcrossed. PI 3 K-null adults, although a little less thermotolerant, are considerably more resistant to oxidative and electrophilic stresses than <b>worms</b> <b>bearing</b> normal or less long-lived alleles. Their unprecedented factorial gains in survival, under both normal and toxic environments, are attributed to elimination of residual and maternally contributed PI 3 K CS or its products, and consequent modification of kinase signaling cascades.

40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of tilting table driven by worm and worm wheel Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of tilting table behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} tilting table driven by worm and worm wheel in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of tilting table system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of worm and worm wheel, the torsional stiffness of worm wheel shaft, and the axial stiffness of <b>worm</b> supporting <b>bearings.</b> Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Nessa primeira parte do trabalho referente ao estudo dos Procamallanus brasileiros, os autores propoêm que Spirocamallanus Olsen, 1952, seja aceito apenas como um bom subgênero, baseando-se exclusivamente no aspecto de cápsula bucal. Assi, Spirocamallanus identifica os camalanídeos de cápsula bucal com lâminas espiraladas ou outras estruturas semelhantes, enquanto que Procamallanus se aplicaria aos de cápsula bucal lisa. Quanto às demais subdivisões existentes para o gênero, apoiadas em aspecto e quantidade de espículos, são consideradas resultado de um critério bastante arbitrário para conservarem-se válidas, visto serem os espículos caracteres sujeitos a diversas interpretações por parte dos especialistas, devido à fragilidade que os toma tão sujeitos a modificações no grupo dos camalanídeos. Três espécies são aqui tratadas: Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) rarus Travassos, Artigas & Pereira, 1928, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) pimelodus, e Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) intermedius. As duas últimas são propostas como novas. Procamallanus (S.) pimelodus é comparada a Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) olseni Campana-Rouget & Razahihelissoa, 1965, dela se distinguindo, principalmente, por apresentar o rebordo da asa caudal franjado e fortemente musculoso. Procamallanus (S.) intermedius aproxima-se unicamente de Procamallanus (S.) rarus, por apresentar o espículo maior com bifurcação distal e dela se afasta pelo maior número e menor espessura das lâminas espiraladas na cápsula bucal. Para Procamallanus (S.) rarus é apresentada a descrição da fêmea, a redescrição do macho, salientando-se pela primeira vez no gênero, o aspecto {{singular}} do espículo maior, aspecto esse também observado ao se lidar com Procamallanus (S.) intermedius, depois de se ter tido acesso ao exemplar tipo e único de Procamallanus (S.) rarus. Foram examinadas 31 amostras de material que faz parte da Coleção Helmintológica do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. By introducing {{this work}} on brazilian nematodes under Procamallanus Baylis, 1923, the authors propose that Spirocamallanus Olsen, 1952, must be regarded {{only as a}} good subgenus based on the aspect of the buccal capsule. For this reason, Spirocamallanus should identify those <b>worms</b> <b>bearing</b> spiral thickenings, as well as similar structures inside their buccal cavity while Procamallanus may be applied every time the nematodes present a completely smooth capsule, lacking the above mentioned structures. Regarding to the early propositions in order to subdivide the genus using number {{and shape of the}} spicules as differential characters, the authors fully disagree with this point of view, which is rather a poor criterion, for the spicules are weakly chitinised in this group and for this reason they do not present enough strutural uniformity to be of great systematic significance. The authors deal here with three species: Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) rarus Travassos, Artigas & Pereira, 1928, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) pimelodus and Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) intermedius. The last two are proposed as new species. Procamallanus (S.) pimelodus is related to Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) olseni Campanarouget & Razahihelissoa, 1965 and differs from it mainly by its caudal alae which shows a strongly muscular fringed rim. Procamallanus (S.) intermedius only comes nearer to Procamallanus (S.) rarus by possessing the bigger spicule with distal bifurcation and differs from it by the aspect of the buccal capsule which has more and thinner spiral thickenings. Of Procamallanus (S.) rarus, the female is described, a redescription of the male is presented and the very peculiar aspect of the bigger spicule is pointed {{out for the first time}} in the genus. This was also observed when dealing with Procamallanus (S.) intermedius, after examining the type of Procamallanus (S.) rarus. In this first part of the work the authors handled 31 samples of nematodes as follows: From intestines of Pimelodus clarias (L.) (27); Catfish (indeterminate) (3) and Pimelodella lateristriga (Müll. Trosch.) (1) ...|$|R
40|$|Neurobiological {{research}} in genetically tractable organisms {{relies heavily on}} robust assays for behav-ioral phenotypes. The simple body plan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans makes it particularly amenable {{to the use of}} automatedmicroscopy and image analysis to describe behavioral patterns quan-titatively. Forward genetic screens and screens of drug libraries require high-throughput phenotyping, a task traditionally incompatible with manual scoring of quantitatively varying behaviors. High-throughput automated analysis of C. elegansmovement behavior is now possible with several different tracking software packages. The Multiworm Tracker (MWT) described here is designed for high-throughput analysis: it can record dozens of worms simultaneously at 30 frames per second for hours or days at a time. This is accomplished by performing all image analysis in real time, saving only the <b>worm</b> centroid, <b>bearing,</b> and outline data to the disk. To simplify image processing, the system focuses only on worms that have moved, and detects and discards worms that are touching rather than trying to isolate them computationally. Because the software is entirely automated, proto-cols can run unattended once the worms have been placed and the software has been started. The MWTdoes not save images for later analysis, but behavior can be validatedmanually with a companion analysis tool that replays recorded body postures. This protocol describes a basic basal movement assay on food using the MWT; similar protocols apply to related assays and to similar multiple animal track-ers. The protocol can be extended to a variety of assays ranging from tap response to chemotaxis.

40|$|Trustee, Sahishnatha Trust who {{conducted}} these initiatives. The authors are thankful to Ms. V. Vidya for the statistical support. A child’s life {{centers around the}} home, school and community. These places should be healthy places where they can thrive, protected from diseases, but in reality these are most often the unhealthiest of places. This is primarily responsible {{for the majority of}} the deaths and the disease burden among children of the developing world. Every year more than 5 million children die due to diseases linked to the poor conditions of the environments in which they live, learn and play – in other words their homes, schools and their community. Degraded environments are the breeding grounds for germs, <b>worms</b> and disease <b>bearing</b> insects. Diseases such as malaria, schistosomasis, dengue fever and cholera debilitate half a billion children every year. Many environmental risks to children’s health are aggravated by persistent poverty, conflicts, and natural and man made disaster and the prevailing conditions of social inequity. These have detrimental effect on the child’s growth and development. The development of the child starts inside the uterus of the mother and advers...|$|R
40|$|The {{family of}} the {{aromatic}} amino acid hydroxylases (AAAH) is well studied in mammals. It includes four members, i. e. phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the tryptophan hydroxylases (TPH 1 and 2). These enzymes share important features, such as domain organization, three dimensional structure and mechanism of the reaction. The AAAH have important functions and are related to genetic human diseases. PAH, expressed in liver, {{is in charge of}} L-Phe catabolism from the diet and mutations in the PAH gene lead to phenylketonuria (PKU), a paradigm for genetic metabolic diseases. TH and the TPHs are enzymes of the neuroendocrine system, that carry out the rate limiting steps in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and hormones, i. e. catecholamines (TH) and serotonin and melatonin (TPHs). Mutations in TH and the TPHs genes are also involved in important neurological diseases and disorders, such as some forms of dystonia and parkinsonism in the case of TH and mood disorders in TPH. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism widely used in biology. We here present the expression and characterization of two AAAH from the nematode, PAH and TH, in order to get insights into evolution of structure, function and regulation in this enzymatic family. In the case of PAH we found functional and molecular similarities between C. elegans PAH (cePAH) and human PAH (hPAH), although they display important differences in enzymatic activity regulation, especially regarding the regulation exerted by the substrate, L-Phe. Both the preactivation and the positive cooperativity induced by the substrate on mammalian PAHs were absent in cePAH. In vivo experiments with knock-out <b>worms</b> <b>bearing</b> a deletion in the pah gene (pah- 1) demonstrated that cePAH is involved in the synthesis of a melanin-like compound that localizes in the cuticle. The study of the recombinant TH from C. elegans (ceTH) in comparison with human TH (hTH) also revealed important differences at the level of short-term activity regulation. Basic regulatory mechanisms for hTH, such as substrate inhibition and feed-back inhibition by the end catecholamine products, appear to be absent in ceTH, suggesting a less tight regulation of enzymatic activity in the worm. But interestingly, ceTH was effectively phosphorylated by cAMPdependent protein kinase (PKA) at Ser 35, though this modification did not translate into activation of the enzyme in synergy with the feed-back inhibition by catecholamines, as it is the case for phosphorylation of hTH at the equivalent Ser 40. We hypothesised that phosphorylation of ceTH could regulate the interaction with other proteins and/or control subcellular localization. Supplementation with BH 4 has been recently established as a therapeutic intervention for PKU. A main effect of the cofactor is the stabilisation of misfolded PKU mutants, and BH 4 appears to function as a natural chaperone molecule. Since BH 4 is a shared cofactor by all the AAAH we set to investigate the effect of BH 4 supplementation on rat brain TH. Higher doses of BH 4 than those currently used for the treatment of PKU were needed to increase the cofactor concentration in brain, most probably due to the selectivity of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). This indicates that the current treatments using lower doses of BH 4 (up to 20 mg/kg/day) are not expected to affect neuronal TH and TPH 2. An increment of total TH protein and activity was measured in the brains of wild-type (wt) mice upon treatment with 100 mg BH 4 /kg/day, suggesting that BH 4 also functions as a natural chaperone in the case of TH. In agreement with these effects, in vitro experiments also showed the capability of BH 4 to stabilise TH. Finally, the screening of chemical libraries of small organic compounds is arising as a promising tool to find specific stabilisers of proteins (i. e. pharmacological chaperones). In the case of PAH, four stabilising compounds (compounds I-IV) were found in a previous study, revealing their potential as therapeutic pharmacological chaperones for PKU. As in the case of BH 4, it was interesting to study the effect of these four molecules upon neuronal TH and TPH 2. We found that compound III stabilized the three AAAH investigated, whereas the other compounds exerted different enzyme specific effects. In vivo studies with supplemented mice revealed the potential of compound III to treat TH-associated diseases. These results are important not only for the development of new specific therapies, but also to unravel enzyme specific/non specific ligand binding in the AAAH family...|$|R
