5|$|The {{excavation}} yielded no finds, {{and thus}} it produced no means of reliably dating {{the construction of the}} site. Wainwright suggested that the ring <b>was</b> <b>Early</b> Bronze Age on the basis of other, dated circles in Britain. Based on his analysis of the site's stratigraphy, he argued that the stones had likely been removed from their original position amid agricultural development {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|The next {{period in}} the history of English <b>was</b> <b>Early</b> Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and {{linguistic}} standardisation.|$|E

5|$|An {{image of}} one of Onyx's early prototypes {{surfaced}} online, with a similar hardware to the 9000's, including the same trackball. That prototype <b>was</b> <b>early</b> reviewed by website CrackBerry, which confirmed diverse details about the device, such as the 480×360 display, the 3.2 megapixels camera and connectivity features—Wi-Fi and GPS. The same day, other information regarding technicalities were revealed on a surfaced AT filesheet about the smartphone. Already known as the BlackBerry 9020 and having started production, {{a photo of the}} device surfaced, though it replaced the trackball with a trackpad. A previous prototype with a trackball was put up for sale on eBay, where it passed the mark of $600; four days later, a pre-launch list of then-upcoming smartphones for AT surfaced online on August 9, 2009, which listed the device. A T-Mobile press image was leaked on September 8.|$|E
5|$|Buckner had {{difficulty}} {{traveling to the}} West, and it <b>was</b> <b>early</b> summer before he arrived. He assumed command of the District of West Louisiana on August 4. Shortly after Buckner arrived at Smith's headquarters in Shreveport, Louisiana, Smith began requesting a promotion for him. The promotion to lieutenant general came on September 20. Smith placed Buckner {{in charge of the}} critical but difficult task of selling the department's cotton through enemy lines.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the island}} <b>was</b> <b>early</b> on {{targeted}} by the Muslims, the first raid occurring in 652, {{only a few years}} after the establishment of the first Muslim navy. Following the onset of Muslim attacks against North Africa, it became a crucial strategic base, and for a while, in 661–668, it was the residence of the imperial court under Constans II. Constituted as a theme around 690, its governing strategos also came to assume control over the scattered imperial possessions in the southern Italian mainland. The island was raided thereafter, especially {{in the first half of}} the 8th century, but did not come under serious threat until the Muslims completed their conquest of North Africa and moved into Hispania as well. It was Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, the Abbasid governor of Ifriqiya, who first made plans to invade the island in force and attempt to capture it and Sardinia in 752–753, but he was thwarted by a Berber rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Double Dash {{was first}} shown at E3 2001 as a seven-second video clip. The clip {{featured}} Mario and Luigi driving their karts on a bump mapped 3D surface with no background. At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>early</b> in development, {{and the working}} title of the game was simply Mario Kart. In April 2003, Nintendo released the first pictures and details of the game, as well as revealing the title to be Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. At E3 2003, a playable demo of the game was available. New features, such as having two characters drive one kart, had been implemented. An updated demo with some new additions was shown at the Games Convention in August 2003. In September, Nintendo held a Gamers' Summit for the press, in which a nearly complete and more sped up version of Double Dash was displayed. The Gamers' Summit also announced the North American release date to be November 17, 2003.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, Lucas {{revealed}} that Radioland Murders {{was still in}} development, and that both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the planned start date <b>was</b> <b>early</b> 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, Radioland Murders remained in development hell. Between this time, Lucas commissioned Theodore J. Flicker to perform a rewrite. In early 1993 Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 2014, {{a digital}} service {{courtesy}} of the FXNOW app, called Simpsons World, launched. Simpsons World has every episode of the series accessible to authenticated FX subscribers, and is available on game consoles such as Xbox One, streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and online via web browser. There <b>was</b> <b>early</b> criticism of both wrong aspect ratios for earlier episodes {{and the length of}} commercial breaks on the streaming service, but there are now fewer commercial breaks during individual episodes. Later it was announced that Simpsons World would now let users watch all of the SD episodes in their original format.|$|E

5|$|The Flames {{entered the}} 2010 NHL Entry Draft without a {{selection}} {{in the first}} two rounds. They would have picked 13th overall, however that pick was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes as part of a 2009 trade for Olli Jokinen. Their second round pick went to the Chicago Blackhawks as part of a 2008 deal in which Calgary acquired Rene Bourque. The Flames' first selection <b>was</b> <b>early</b> in the third round, a pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Anton Stralman. They selected Max Reinhart with that pick. His father Paul was also a former Flames draft pick. Calgary made one trade at the draft, sending their sixth round pick (163rd overall) to the Sharks in exchange for goaltender Henrik Karlsson.|$|E
5|$|Various feeding {{behaviours}} were proposed before {{more complete}} remains of Deinocheirus were known, and it <b>was</b> <b>early</b> on envisioned as a predatory, allosaur-like animal with giant arms. In their original description, Osmólska and Roniewicz {{found that the}} hands of Deinocheirus were unsuited for grasping, but could instead {{have been used to}} tear prey apart. In 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky compared the forelimbs of Deinocheirus to sloths, leading him to hypothesise that Deinocheirus was a specialised climbing dinosaur, that fed on plants and animals found in trees. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul instead suggested that the claws were too blunt for predatory purposes, but would have been good defensive weapons. While attempting to determine the ecological niches for Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus in 2010, Phil Senter and James H. Robins suggested that Deinocheirus had the largest vertical feeding range due to its hip height, and specialised in eating high foliage.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of Banagher {{as a military}} position on the Shannon and on the highway from Leinster and Munster to Connacht <b>was</b> <b>early</b> appreciated by the English, whose forces seized it about {{the middle of the}} 16th century, coming up the river to do so. They constructed some fortifications which they called Fort Frankford (later Fort Falkland) and held the place {{in spite of the fact}} that the part of Offaly for some miles around Banagher was in the hands of the MacCoghlan clan. The MacCoghlans, aided by boundaries of bog and river, held their territories against all comers for about 500 years, even maintaining a footing by open defiance well into the 17th century. Garry Castle, Clonony Castle, and Moystown Castle are remains of MacCoghlan strongholds. Sometime after 1554, when Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain, Offaly County was named King's County in honour of Philip, but it is doubtful if the royal jurisdiction extended to any of the MacCoghlan areas except Banagher. Ultimately, the MacCoghlans were overthrown and their lands were planted by order of James I issued in 1621.|$|E
50|$|The {{constituency}} in 2008 {{was formed}} after merging the assembly segments of Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Madurantakam (SC), Uthiramerur and Kancheepuram, which <b>were</b> <b>earlier</b> {{part of the}} now defunct Chengalpattu Lok Sabha constituency, and Alandur, which <b>was</b> <b>earlier</b> part of Chennai South Lok Sabha constituency.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{cross wall}} subdividing each floor. These walls appear to <b>be</b> <b>early</b> insertions. Probably there <b>were</b> <b>earlier,</b> less permanent, cross partitions.

5|$|Vanguards {{first task}} after {{completing}} her sea trial {{at the end}} of 1946 <b>was,</b> <b>early</b> the next year, to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch. While refitting after her return, she was selected for another Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George's declining health and Vanguard briefly became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, Vanguard was involved in a number of training exercises with NATO forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Review. While she was refitting in 1955, the Admiralty announced that the ship was going to be put into reserve upon completion of the work. Vanguard was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960.|$|E
