5|$|Along {{with the}} course curriculum, the exam is {{developed}} by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested <b>with</b> <b>college</b> students taking statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate level of difficulty and clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E

There are several other elected non-executive officers such as Returning Officer, Fresher Rep and Sports Captain who organise other important college functions.

5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch {{was to leave}} the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions <b>with</b> <b>College</b> Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green {{before coming to the}} surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was to connect to the DR. The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E
5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those <b>with</b> <b>college</b> degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, Caltrans had two {{proposals}} {{for the part}} of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of the San Luis Rey River. Concerns arose that the TransNet local sales tax would not be extended by voters, leading to the cancellation of that project. The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall in the regional plan in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR76 {{was one of the few}} TransNet projects that was not to be completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008. The city of Oceanside proposed plans for grade-separated interchanges <b>with</b> <b>College</b> Boulevard and Melrose Drive in 2004, as part of a proposal to convert the expressway through Oceanside to a freeway. After complaints from residents, these proposals were tabled.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, SpongeBob SquarePants {{signed a}} {{marketing}} deal with Target Corporation and Burger King, expanding its merchandising.

In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan, as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Ratings and merchandise sales showed SpongeBob SquarePants has caught on with parents and <b>with</b> <b>college</b> audiences. In a recent promotion, college-oriented website Music.com gave away 80,000 SpongeBob T-shirts, four times more than during a similar promotion for Comedy Central's South Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (MACOC) took over the Peach Bowl. The bowl {{executive}} director {{at the time was}} Dick Bestwick, and he encouraged the Chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the Lions Club. In 1986, the Peach Bowl had no contractual obligations <b>with</b> <b>college</b> football conferences, as its successor, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, does today. Team selections were made by the Peach Bowl committee, a board of Atlanta community members, business leaders, and organizers of the Peach Bowl. To form one half of the matchup, the committee selected second-place Atlantic Coast Conference team NC State, which accepted the bowl bid on November 22, 1986, the day of their final regular-season game. The other half of the matchup was Virginia Tech, a football independent that had finished with nine wins, one loss, and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded.|$|E
5|$|One of {{its most}} {{successful}} periods followed during the Second World War when personnel of the Durham University Air Squadron were posted in the castle, doing short courses before joining the Royal Air Force. Those from the college who died during World War II were commemorated by the redevelopment of the Norman Gallery area of the Castle in the 1950s. This period also saw the launch of Castellum, an annual journal of the Castle Society, created to keep former students in touch <b>with</b> <b>college</b> life. In order to continue this expansion, the college purchased Lumley Castle in 1946 to house students, and by 1948 seventy five students were housed there. This section of the college developed a spirit of its own and is still remembered today through activities such as the Lumley Run.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the Millstone River, US 1 enters Plainsboro Township, where it passes more business parks {{and comes to}} an interchange with Scudders Mill Road.

An interchange <b>with</b> <b>College</b> Road a short distance later provides access to both places. The route continues into South Brunswick Township, where it narrows to four lanes and runs through a mix of rural areas and development. US 1 briefly widens back to six lanes as it reaches an intersection with CR 522. Past CR 522, the surroundings of the four-lane road become more forested, with a few commercial establishments. The road briefly forms the border between South Brunswick Township to the northwest and North Brunswick Township to the southeast before fully entering North Brunswick Township.|$|E
