40|$|The {{effect of}} exposing grouted precast <b>wall</b> <b>connections</b> to subfreezing curing {{temperatures}} at early-age was explored in this study. In cold weather construction, heating {{of the surrounding}} environment of grouted precast <b>wall</b> <b>connections</b> is usually conducted for short periods of time. Hence, subfreezing conditions can affect {{the strength of the}} grout and the bond strength of the connection, which can ultimately compromise the integrity of the structure. In this study, grout specimens typical of that used in precast wall construction were cured at ambient conditions for one day, and then placed in an environmental chamber at subfreezing temperatures (- 10 °C and - 20 °C). The compressive strength development of the grout was monitored, and the bond strength of grouted connections cured at cold temperature were quantified and compared to that of specimens cured at ambient temperature. The bond was investigated on 25 M deformed steel bars, which is the typical size used in precast concrete <b>wall</b> grouted <b>connections.</b> Test results indicate a reduction in grout strength and the need for a longer embedment length when early-age curing is conducted at subfreezing conditions...|$|R

50|$|Originally, {{the line}} cord and handset cord were secured by {{screw-down}} terminals at both ends, with a strain relief anchor. Both cords had matching colors, but most color sets initially were produced with neutral, dark gray cords, with {{exception of the}} ivory and brown sets. Starting in 1955, all sets, except dark blue were equipped with color-matched cords as dyes and manufacturing methods became stable. By 1973, line cords were changed to a neutral gray color and from a round to a flat cross-section. As a customer option, telephone sets could be ordered for portability with four-prong plugs, but most sets were hard-wired to <b>wall</b> <b>connection</b> boxes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} a relationship between the type of <b>wall</b> <b>connection</b> used in the cast grates, which are part of the equipment operating in furnaces for heat treatment and thermal-chemical treatment, and stresses generated in these grates during the process of rapid cooling. The places where the grate walls are connected to each other are usually characterized by the thickness larger than the remaining parts of walls. Temperature variations in those places are responsible for the formation of hot spots, and in the hot spots temperature changes much more slowly. The type of <b>wall</b> <b>connection</b> shapes the temperature gradient in the joint cross-section, and hence also the value of thermal stresses generated during cooling. In this study, five different designs of the grates were compared; the difference in them was the type of the designed <b>wall</b> <b>connection.</b> The following design variants were adopted in the studies: X connections with and without holes, T connections with and without technological recesses, and R (ring) connection. Numerical analysis was performed to examine how the distribution of temperature changes in the initial phases of the cooling process. The obtained results served next as a tool in studies of the stress distribution in individual structures. The analysis were carried out by FEM in Midas NFX 2014 software. Based on the results obtained, the conclusions were drawn about the impact of different types of wall connections on the formation of thermal stresses in cast grates...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Nailed {{connections}} have nonlinear load-displacement relations. Modeling {{these connections}} in an assembled structure {{would require a}} great amount of computational time because of the large number of degrees of freedom. Replacing these connections with energetically-equivalent nonlinear springs reduces the number of degrees of freedom, and leads to computational efficiency in full structure models. This study examined four connections that were used in a light-frame structure that was built and tested under simulated wind loads. The connections examined were an exterior wall-to-floor connection, an interior wall-to-roof truss connection, an exterior wall-to-exterior <b>wall</b> <b>connection,</b> and an interior wall-to-exterior <b>wall</b> <b>connection.</b> The details of the four connections were modeled by using the finite-element method as either a two-dimensional plane stress model, or a three-dimensional model.

40|$|Contemporary {{houses in}} many parts of Australia are brick veneer {{structures}} with metal or tile clad roofs that are built by trained builders using skilled labourers working to engineering design specifications. However, windstorms can cause significant damage to houses hence; {{there is a need to}} study the load sharing and response of these structural systems to assess their vulnerability. A full-scale test was carried out on a representative brick veneer contemporary house to assess the loading effects on roof to <b>wall</b> <b>connection</b> and load sharing. Tests were carried out at each stage of construction: bare frame followed by the installation of roof battens and cladding, wall lining, ceiling etc. These construction stages were used to assess the contribution of the structural and nonstructural (i. e. ceiling, ceiling cornice and wall lining) elements to the load sharing and response of the timberframed house structure to wind loading. The full-scale test, results show that the vertical load sharing of the timber-framed house through the roof to <b>wall</b> <b>connection</b> depends on the stiffness of the connection and the truss location (i. e. whether located at the end or middle). The contribution of the non- structural elements to the load sharing is about 15 % to 20 %.

40|$|The out-of-plane failure {{mechanisms}} due to seismic action observed in masonry walls of historical buildings are, in many cases, {{a direct result}} of poor connections between structural elements, which are incapable of assuring proper load transmission. Therefore, the need to prevent its occurrence raises critical importance around their unstrengthened and strengthened behaviour. A typical example is the connection between external and internal walls or between walls and floors. The wall-to-half-timbered <b>wall</b> <b>connections</b> are representative of connections existent in ‘Pombalino’ and ‘Gaioleiro’ buildings, constructed during the post-earthquake (1755) reconstruction of downtown Lisbon. In order to better understand the seismic performance of masonry wall-to-half-timbered <b>wall</b> <b>connections</b> and to increase information found in literature, a series of 5 tests were carried out in representative real scale specimens in which injected anchors were installed in an irregular stone masonry wall in order to improve the seismic response of the connection. Monotonic and cyclic pull-out tests were performed on representative connections in order to assess their performance and allow their characterization. Parameters considered include: failure mode, hysteretic curve, strength degradation and total energy. The results contribute to the existent body of knowledge on the topic, by expanding the experimental database. For further development, the experimental data allows the calibration of representative numerical models, enabling parametric studies of material properties and formulation of backbone curves.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} a reinforced concrete multi-storey building with dissipative structural walls. These walls can improve the behaviour of a tall multi-storey building. The authors' main objective is to evaluate the damage of a building with dissipative walls in comparison with that of a building with solid walls. In this paper,a comparative nonlinear dynamic analysis between a building with slit walls and then the same building with solid walls is performed by means of SAP 2000 software and using a layer model. The solution to increase the seismic performance of a building with structural walls is to create slit zones with short connections in to the <b>walls.</b> The short <b>connections</b> are introduced as a link element with multi-linear pivot hysteretic plasticity behaviour. The hysteretic rules and parameters of these short connections were proposed by the authors and used in this analysis. In this study, the authors propose to evaluate the damage of a building with reinforced concrete slit <b>walls</b> with short <b>connections</b> using seismic analysis. Using the computational model created by the authors for the slit wall, a seismic analysis of a multi-storey building with slit walls was done. From the results obtained, the advantages of the proposed model are observed.

In Australia, Contemporary houses are generally brick veneer structures with metal or tile clad roofs. Previous studies on damage to timber framed houses show that the roof structure of a house is vulnerable to windstorms. This indicates the need to study their structural response to mitigate their failures in windstorms.

Finite element (FE) analysis using ABAQUS (6. 12 - 3) software is {{used in this study}} to determine the {{structural response}} and uplift capacities of typical roof to wall connections. Results (i. e. force-displacement relationship and failure modes) of the FE model were compared with experimental tests and the model validated from the test results. The FE model accounts for large deformation as well as the contact between nail and timber through the elastic and post-elastic phases up to failure. The dominant failure modes observed are nails and framing anchor bending, and nail pull out. The FE model produced structural responses and uplift capacities that generally agree with the experimental results. Construction defects (i. e. missing nails) in a roof to <b>wall</b> <b>connection</b> influences the design uplift capacity. Nails located near the centre line of the loading action in a triple grip connection (i. e. common roof to <b>wall</b> <b>connection</b> used in the timber-framed house of Australia) significantly affect the stiffness of this connection.
