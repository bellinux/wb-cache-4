However, the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked and captured Beach and Sea Posts before attacking the Rafa Redoubt and trench systems, suffering light casualties.

Two reserve tanks were ordered forward carrying engineers' storesincluding sandbags which were set on fire by hostile fire.|$|E
5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The <b>Wire,</b> <b>as</b> well as the renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn {{to the idea of}} building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the orders}} of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces had {{constructed}} {{a large number of}} static defensive positions and obstacles. Rommel had been appointed Inspector General of Coastal Defences and commander of Army Group B, in November 1943, by order of Adolf Hitler. On his arrival he had assessed the existing defences in the region and immediately began the process of improving them, particularly those situated inland as he believed no more than thirty percent of the German defences were adequate. These anti-airborne measures consisted of planting a large number of mines to create minefields, as well as the erection of so-called Rommel's asparagus; a system of wire-braced poles up to two metres in height, a great many of which were laced with mines or other booby-traps aimed at destroying gliders and killing or wounding airborne troops. Rommel noted in his diary, following an inspection of one area, that a division had placed over 300,000 stakes in the ground to deter airborne landings, and a corps had erected over 900,000. The Merville artillery battery was a particularly heavily fortified position. From the beach, it was protected by two strongpoints that included approximately thirty bunkers as well as an observation post, and the battery itself consisted of a bunker containing the battery's command post, two blockhouses, a light flak emplacement and four casemates able to contain artillery pieces up to dimensions of 150mm. The entire battery covered an area roughly four hundred metres in diameter and was surrounded by an inner perimeter of barbed wire, a minefield, and an outer perimeter of barbed <b>wire</b> <b>as</b> well as an anti-tank ditch.|$|E

25|$|However, the Sotenos {{are best}} known for Tree of Life sculptures. The {{time it takes to}} {{complete}} a Tree depends on size and complexity, anywhere from a day to two months of 15-hour workdays. Sizes can range from twenty centimeters to over a meter in height. The sculptures are made from the reddish and yellow clays found in a nearby community called Ocotitlán. The mined clay is left out to dry and the clumps broken up, sometimes but putting them out into the street for cars to roll over. As needed, the powdered clay is mixed with water and a flower called “tule” to soften and whiten the clay. The small details may be made with molds, but a number of artisans in the family, including Oscar, prefer to do it all by hand. Details and branches may be attached or reinforced by wire, but both Oscar and Tiburcio avoid the use of <b>wire</b> <b>as</b> it can break over time. The piece is carefully dried and fired. The largest trees may be fired in separate parts and in stages. Then they painted with anilines, natural pigments, acrylics and sometimes enamel.|$|E
25|$|Fiji {{returned}} for four {{games in the}} New Zealand summer of 1954, but only managed to win one.

Then came the one-hour century against Canterbury with eight sixes and five fours, as Fiji plundered 344 from 65.3 overs in the second innings to set Canterbury a challenging 217 – which they managed for the loss of eight wickets. This was Bula's last century, and indeed his last score above 30 – as he was pushed down the order to No. 6 against Wellington, he made 23 and 26, but Wellington still forced a 117-run win, before Bula rounded off his first class career with a seven-wicket win over Auckland – in a match that was shortened from three days to one due to rain. However, a two-innings game was still played, as the first three innings were all declared closed. Fiji were set 79 to win in a relatively short time, but after falling to 51 for 3 Bula hit 23 not out to guide Fiji to their fourth – and so far last – first class victory.|$|E
