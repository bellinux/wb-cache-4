40|$|Usually, the {{long-term}} investigations compare only average crop yields and overlook their stability. This research {{was intended to}} evaluate the influence of long-term rotation of annual crops and nitrogen fertilization regime, as well as rotation breaking with a perennial alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plot, on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields and their stability. Cropping systems were: (i) monoculture; (ii) 2 yr winter <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> corn (Zea mays L.); (iii) 3 yr winter <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> corn – soybean [Glycine max (L) Merr]); and (iv) 4 yr winter <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> corn – sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) – peas (Pisum sativum L.). Nitrogen fertilization regimes were: N 0 (no fertilization), N 50 kg ha‾, N 100 kg ha‾, and N 150 kg ha‾, applied on an uniform P 70 back-ground. Rotation breaking with a perennial alfalfa plot resulted in a significant winter wheat yield increase of 4. 8 %, {{when compared with the}} variant without rotation breaking, on which a mean winter wheat yield of 4. 024 t ha‾ was obtained. The highest winter wheat mean yield was registered in the 4 year rotation variant (4. 592 t ha‾) and the lowest- in the case of 2 yr rotation (3. 656 t ha‾), being 8. 5 % and 16. 7 % lower than the yields obtained with monoculture and 3 yr rotation, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization determined a substantial yield increase, from 2. 639 t ha‾ without N fertilization, to 4. 808 ha‾ recorded with N 100 kg ha‾. Large yield increases were recorded also with N 50 kg ha‾ and N 150 kg ha‾ fertilization, of 64. 2 % and 78. 1 %, respectively, compared to N 0...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of crop yield in areas with different technologies of cultivation based on the network of automatic stations that provide data on climatic and soil-hydrological monitoring in the dry steppe during the vegetation period of May–September 2013 – 2016. These data  on regional ecological and climatic parameters are of great interest to the ecologists, plant physiologists, and farmers working in the Kulunda Plain (Altai Territory). We compared the following options for cropping technologies: the modern system, which is the "no-till", technology without autumn tillage;the intensive technology of deep autumn tillage by plough PG- 3 - 5 at a depth of 22 – 24 cm. Cultivation of crops was carried out using the following scheme of crop rotation: the modern system: 1 – 2 – 3 <b>–</b> 4 (<b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> peas <b>–</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> rape); the intensive system: 5 / 6 – 7 / 8 – 9 / 10 (fallow <b>–</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> <b>wheat).</b> We believe that the use of modern technology in these conditions is better due to exchange between the different layers of soil. When  the ordinary Soviet system, the so-called "plow sole", was used, at a depth of 24 cm, we observed that this creates a water conductivity barrier that seems to preclude the possibility of lifting water from the lower horizons. Results of the study of infiltration of soil moisture at the depth of 30 and 60 cm  have shown in some years the advantages of the modern technology over the ordinary Soviet system: in the version with the use of modern technology we can trace better exchange between the various horizons and, probably,  moisture replenishment from the lower horizons. Differences in individual observation periods are comparatively large due to the redistribution of soil moisture, depending on the weather conditions, the crops used in the crop rotations, and cultivation techniques. Moreover, the average moisture reserves within the one meter layer did not show any significant differences during the growing seasons of 2013 – 2016. In terms of soil moisture usage and productive grain yield according to the four year experiment, the application of the modern technology with crop rotation "wheat <b>–</b> rape <b>–</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> peas" was more effective than the ordinary Soviet system with crop rotation "wheat <b>–</b> fallow <b>–</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> wheat". The four-year observation period is clearly insufficient to identify the advantages of the modern system, as during this time it is impossible to significantly improve soil quality indicators, which will continue to determine its water-retaining properties and moisture accumulation...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} Research Experimental Station Dolná Malanta, Western Slovakia during 2009 and 2010 on a Haplic Luvisol developed on proluvial sediments mixed with loess. The altitude of the experimental field was 178 m. The location has a continental climate with an average temperature 19. 7 °C in July and - 1. 7 °C in January, an average annual precipitations are 561 mm. The aim of this work was to evaluate the quality of white and wholegrain noodles made from winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in ecological and integrated farming system. A split - plot design was used with two main treatments, ecological (ES) and integrated (IS) cropping systems. The ecological system was composed of a six course crop rotation: beans + alfalfa – alfalfa <b>–</b> winter <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> peas – maize – spring barley. The integrated system consisted of the crop rotation: winter <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> peas <b>–</b> winter <b>wheat</b> <b>–</b> maize – spring barley – alfalfa (3 years at the same plot). Subplots were fertilised (F) and unfertilised (N) variants. The fertilised variant in ES was based on 40 t of manure while the IS also received 40 t of manure plus synthetic fertilisers. Based on the reached results, winter wheat noodle qualitative parameters were significantly affected by farming system, fertilisation, forecrop and by external impacts of the weather. Noodle quality evaluated by cooking time, volume and weight of cooked noodles, noodle absorption and by cooking loss showed higher values {{of each of the}} cooking quality parameters of wholegrain noodles, it also applies to longer cooking time or higher cooking loss. Noodles from the ecological farming system, especially wholegrain noodles, have better quality than noodles from the winter wheat cultivated in integrated farming system. The positive site of white noodles was their shorter cooking time and appropriate lower cooking loss. In ES was found longer cooking time of both types of noodles, but even so the values of cooking loss in ES was lower than in integrated system...|$|R
