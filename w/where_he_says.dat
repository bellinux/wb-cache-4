500|$|The Brute Man was {{developed}} by Universal Pictures Company, Inc. in the later years of their successful production of horror films, including Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931) and The Mummy (1932). While those films were great critical and financial successes, The Brute Man was filmed during what was widely considered the low point of the studio's horror film period. It was produced by Ben Pivar and directed by Jean Yarbrough, both of whom had worked on House of Horrors and many other horror films for Universal over the years. The Brute Man was filmed in 13 days, during November 1945. The flashback scenes—which depict how Hal Moffet became disfigured and ultimately became the Creeper—were all shot {{on the final day}} of filming. Jane Adams said Hatton's acromegaly was becoming progressively worse by the time The Brute Man was filmed, and it made acting difficult for him. Hatton had trouble remembering his lines, focusing on his performance, and responding to the other actors. Hatton occasionally appears confused even on screen, like during one scene <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> [...] "yes" [...] while shaking his head [...] "no." [...] Adams called him a friendly and thoughtful man, but called him [...] "so pathetic to work with [...] almost autistic".|$|E

Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake and incorporates themes of [...] "sex and romance". Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the vocal delivery and lyrical content of the song as [...] "sassy". Lamb as said that [...] "lyrically, [...] amounts to romantic, sexual sweet nothings". Rihanna called the collaboration [...] "young and playful", something which Stacy Anderson from Spin and Nick Levine of Digital Spy both picked up, when commenting on the sexual innuendos in the lyrics. In particular, [...] Anderson and Levine noted an arithmetic-based joke during Drake's guest vocal, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> [...] "The square root of 69 is 8 something, right / 'Cuz I been trying to work it out".
