5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the path}} taken by the player, Jill's final {{encounter}} with Nicholai <b>will</b> <b>differ.</b> In one version of the events, Nicholai will attempt to start a gunfight with Jill, only to be taken by surprise by Nemesis. In another event, Nicholai will hijack Jill's intended escape chopper, and the player must choose to either reason with Nicholai or destroy the helicopter. If Jill negotiates with Nicholai, he reveals that he has killed the other supervisors and boasts about collecting the bounty placed on Jill by Umbrella before escaping. Regardless of Nicholai's fate, Jill makes {{her way to the}} rear yard and confronts Nemesis one last time. After an intense battle, Jill defeats Nemesis {{with the help of a}} prototype railgun before meeting up with Carlos and escaping the city via a helicopter. If the previous escape chopper was stolen by Nicholai, Jill and Carlos will instead meet up with S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team's weapons specialist Barry Burton, who helps them escape in his own helicopter instead. The final cutscene of the game shows the thermobaric missile strike vaporizing the Raccoon City and its infected populace.|$|E
50|$|OMP2HMPP, a tool that, {{automatically}} translates {{a high-level}} C source code(OpenMP) code into HMPP. The generated version rarely <b>will</b> <b>differs</b> from a hand-coded HMPP version, and {{will provide an}} important speedup, near 113%, that could be later improved by hand-coded CUDA.|$|R
25|$|A joint <b>will</b> <b>differs</b> substantively from {{a mutual}} will {{in that the}} former is not {{intended}} to be irrevocable or to express a mutual intention; it is merely an administrative convenience. A will may be both joint (on one document) and mutual (see below).|$|R
50|$|Households in {{different}} parts of the world <b>will</b> have <b>differing</b> levels of consumption, based on latitude and technology.|$|R
25|$|Aside {{from even}} that number of combination, {{each set of}} {{combinations}} <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> by class. So the aforementioned Guardian with a Destrier steed/in Red Dawn stance/traited Riddermark <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> from a hunter with a Destrier steed/in Red Dawn stance/traited Riddermark. As such, there are an incredible number of combinations to be explored.|$|E
25|$|The {{completed}} joint Indian/Russian {{versions of}} the single-seat or two-seat FGFA <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> from the current T-50 flying prototypes in 43 ways with improvements to stealth, supercruise, sensors, networking, and combat avionics.|$|E
25|$|So both methods {{yield the}} same result, but again F {{is more than}} a 1000 times Ka. The next case does not have this {{condition}} and the results <b>will</b> <b>differ.</b>|$|E
50|$|A bachelor's {{degree in}} these two areas <b>will</b> {{typically}} <b>differ</b> only by a few specialized classes, although the mechanical engineering degree requires more mathematics expertise.|$|R
5000|$|Uniqueness can {{be shown}} to be almost sure: that is, {{versions}} of the same conditional expectation <b>will</b> only <b>differ</b> on a set of probability zero.|$|R
5000|$|The early Roman <b>will</b> <b>differed</b> {{from the}} modern will in {{important}} respects. It was effectual during {{the lifetime of}} the person who made it; it was made in public all knew of the legator's intentions, the testator declaring his will in the presence of seven witnesses; and it could not be changedthese they called nuncupative wills; but the danger of trusting the will of the deceased to the memory of the living soon abolished these; and all wills were ordered to be in writing.|$|R
25|$|For some configurations, the {{arrangement}} of pins <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> slightly for the different current ratings, to prevent accidental mating of devices with a higher current draw than the receptacle can support.|$|E
25|$|The {{completed}} joint Indian/Russian {{versions of}} the operational fighters <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> from the current flying prototypes through the addition of stealth, supercruise, sensors, networking, and combat avionics {{for a total of}} 43 improvements.|$|E
25|$|When {{a digital}} image is viewed, a {{reconstruction}} is {{performed by a}} display or printer device, and by the eyes and the brain. If the image data is processed in some ways during sampling or reconstruction, the reconstructed image <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> from the original image, and an alias is seen.|$|E
3000|$|... (using the median, for example), score {{distributions}} in the subsamples <b>will</b> inevitably <b>differ,</b> {{causing the}} observed differences. Therefore, the normal marginals method is {{not eligible for}} that purpose.|$|R
60|$|His brother Edward {{submitted}} to {{what appeared to}} be not only incontestible fact, but a far more likely disposition of old Timothy's property; for, like many others, he had been much surprised at the limitations defined in the other will, having no clue to their cause. He joined his brother Timothy in setting aside the hitherto accepted document, and matters went on in their usual course, there being no dispositions in the substituted <b>will</b> <b>differing</b> from those in the other, except such as related to a future which had not yet arrived.|$|R
50|$|Every {{electric}} motor {{has to have}} some sort of controller. The motor controller <b>will</b> have <b>differing</b> features and complexity depending on the task that the motor will be performing.|$|R
25|$|Airbrush {{technique}} is the freehand {{manipulation of the}} airbrush, medium, air pressure and distance from the surface being sprayed {{in order to produce}} a certain predictable result on a consistent basis with or without shields or stencils. Airbrush technique <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> with the type of airbrush being used (single-action or dual/double-action).|$|E
25|$|As subject {{distance}} is decreased, the subject magnification increases, and eventually becomes large {{in comparison with}} the hyperfocal magnification. Thus the effect of focal length is greatest near the hyperfocal distance, and decreases as {{subject distance}} is decreased. However, the near/far perspective <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> for different focal lengths, so the difference in DOF may not be readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the risk}} of the inverse ETF and a fixed short {{position}} <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> significantly as the index drifts away from its initial value, differences in realized payoff have no clear interpretation. It may therefore be better to evaluate the performance assuming the index returns to the initial level. In that case an inverse ETF will always incur a volatility loss relative to the short position.|$|E
50|$|In {{the model}} &alpha; and &gamma; are always greater than zero, {{and as such}} {{the sign of the}} {{eigenvalues}} above <b>will</b> always <b>differ.</b> Hence the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point.|$|R
50|$|A {{degree in}} {{manufacturing}} versus mechanical engineering <b>will</b> typically <b>differ</b> {{only by a}} few specialized classes, although the mechanical engineering degree focuses more on the product design process and in complex products requires more mathematics expertise.|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>will</b> not <b>differ</b> about terms, sir," [...] {{said the}} colonel, haughtily. [...] "I spoke as duty to my {{sovereign}} prompted; {{but do you}} not call {{the loss of a}} commander a misfortune to a party?" ...|$|R
25|$|Environments may {{impact on}} the ability of genes to express {{themselves}} and may do this via sex differences. For instance genes affecting voting behavior would have no effect in females if females are excluded from the vote. More generally, the logic of sex-difference testing can extend to any defined sub-group of individuals. In cases such as these, the correlation for same and opposite sex DZ twins <b>will</b> <b>differ,</b> betraying the effect of the sex difference.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of genes along the inactive X {{which are not}} silenced explains the defects in humans with abnormal numbers of the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome (X0) or Klinefelter syndrome (XXY). Theoretically, X-inactivation should eliminate the differences in gene dosage between affected individuals and individuals with a normal chromosome complement. In affected individuals, however, X-inactivation is incomplete and the dosage of these non-silenced genes <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> as they escape X-inactivation, similar to an autosomal aneuploidy.|$|E
25|$|Remedies <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> {{according}} {{to the type of}} damage or benefit. They are usually distinguished between proprietary remedies, dealing with property, and personal remedies, dealing with pecuniary (monetary) compensation. Where concurrent contractual and fiduciary relationships exist, remedies available to the plaintiff beneficiary is dependent upon the duty of care owed by the defendant and the specific breach of duty allowing for remedy/damages. The courts will clearly distinguish the relationship and determine the nature in which the breach occurred.|$|E
30|$|Seek {{differential}} {{responses to}} {{a broad range of}} epiphenomena. As a differing self-referential agency, cancer <b>will</b> therefore <b>differ</b> in some crucial aspects from normal cells in its response to epigenetic stresses. Such idiosyncrasies might be exploited [122].|$|R
50|$|In {{contradiction to}} Eagly’s {{findings}} {{of gender differences}} in leadership, multiple studies have also claimed {{that there are no}} significant differences and that both men and women can and <b>will</b> have <b>differing</b> and similar styles of leadership.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} {{possible}} zones in a thermoplastic screw. Since terminology is not standardized in the industry, different names may refer to these zones. Different types of polymer <b>will</b> have <b>differing</b> screw designs, some not incorporating {{all of the}} possible zones.|$|R
25|$|The table below lists, for a Jewish {{year commencing}} on 23 March, the civil {{date of the}} first day of each month. If the year does not begin on 23 March, each month's first day <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> from the date shown by the number of days that {{the start of the year}} differs from 23 March. The correct column is the one which shows the correct {{starting}} date for the following year in the last row. If 29 February falls within a Jewish month the first day of later months will be a day earlier than shown.|$|E
25|$|Direct and inverse {{images of}} sheaves Every {{continuous}} map f : X → Y between topological spaces induces a functor f ∗ from {{the category of}} sheaves (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category of sheaves on Y, the direct image functor. It also induces a functor f −1 from the category of sheaves of abelian groups on Y to the category of sheaves of abelian groups on X, the inverse image functor. f −1 is left adjoint to f ∗. Here a more subtle {{point is that the}} left adjoint for coherent sheaves <b>will</b> <b>differ</b> from that for sheaves (of sets).|$|E
25|$|Thermocouples {{are often}} used at high {{temperatures}} and in reactive furnace atmospheres. In this case, the practical lifetime is limited by thermocouple aging. The thermoelectric coefficients of the wires in a thermocouple {{that is used to}} measure very high temperatures may change with time, and the measurement voltage accordingly drops. The simple relationship between the temperature difference of the junctions and the measurement voltage is only correct if each wire is homogeneous (uniform in composition). As thermocouples age in a process, their conductors can lose homogeneity due to chemical and metallurgical changes caused by extreme or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. If the aged section of the thermocouple circuit is exposed to a temperature gradient, the measured voltage <b>will</b> <b>differ,</b> resulting in error.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, we <b>will</b> not <b>differ</b> about technicalities, {{as long as}} {{the fact}} is the same. You'll {{remember}} my words when you are kept on a diet of Hannah More and Miss Edgeworth till you shall have abjured hounds, balls, and salmon-flies.' ...|$|R
25|$|Budget {{resolutions and}} {{appropriations}} bills, which reflect spending priorities of Congress, <b>will</b> usually <b>differ</b> from funding {{levels in the}} president's budget. The president, however, retains substantial influence over the budget process through veto power and through congressional allies when the president's party has a majority in Congress.|$|R
30|$|The {{arguments}} {{put forward}} {{in this section}} suggest that the changes in employment and earnings trajectories that TFWs may experience as they become permanent residents <b>will</b> likely <b>differ</b> depending on the group they belong to. These hypotheses are tested in Section 4 using a unique Canadian dataset.|$|R
