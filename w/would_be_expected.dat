5|$|In 2006, it was {{discovered}} that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy; they are not randomly arranged as <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> from independent interactions.

5|$|There are 15 known {{isotopes}} {{of carbon}} and the shortest-lived {{of these is}} C which decays through proton emission and alpha decay and has a half-life of 1.98739x10 s.

5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E

5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E
5|$|As <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> for a road {{crossing}} the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many {{roads in the}} North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom {{but it is not}} as dangerous as other roads bisecting hilly terrain in this part of England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E
5|$|During secret {{surrender}} {{negotiations with}} the Allies in early September, the Italian government offered to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the eastern coast. German forces in that area were very weak and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to withdraw rather than fight if the Allies landed there. General Dwight D.

Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, {{and they did not}} work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that the}} impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, because the next pope <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{supported}} his uncle Robert de Chesney's nomination to become Bishop of Lincoln, lobbying the pope on Robert's behalf, {{and maintaining a}} long correspondence with Robert after his elevation. The letters to this uncle are full of warm sentiments, more than <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> of a dutiful correspondence. Other episcopal correspondents and friends included Roger de Pont L'Évêque, the Archbishop of York, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, who became a regular correspondent after Foliot was translated to London.|$|E

However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E

5|$|The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} the first widely recognized periodic table in 1869. He developed his table to illustrate periodic {{trends in the}} properties of the then-known elements. Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to fill gaps in this table. Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour.|$|E

The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.|$|E

5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> from how common it is.|$|E

The First French Republic's finances were in poor shape so its armies <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands. Knowing that the French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68million years ago and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> from a single impact event.|$|E
