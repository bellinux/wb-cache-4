5|$|The main {{exporter}} of rhodium is South Africa (approximately 80% in 2010) followed by Russia. The annual world production is 30 tonnes. The price of rhodium is highly variable. In 2007, rhodium cost approximately eight <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> gold, 450 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> silver, and 27,250 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> copper by weight. In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce ($350,000 per kilogram). The economic slowdown of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce ($35,000 per kilogram); the price rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 ($97,000 per kilogram) (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice the gold price), but in late 2013, the prices {{were less than}} $1000.|$|R

During this period, the urban hierarchy of this province is unbalanced but improving. Regarding the political, economical and cultural aspects, Ardabil city (the center of the province) attracts more immigrants and this fact has made urban hierarchy not follow the Rank-Size Role. In 1986, the population of Ardabil (the most populated city) was 9 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Meshkinshahr (the second populated city) and 10 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Parsabad(the third populated city). Although in 1986, Parsabad was the third populated city but in 1996 it became the second city and the population of Ardabil was 6 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> it. In 2006 urban hierarchy in province has improved and {{the population of the}} first city (Ardabil) has been 5 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the second city (Parsabad) and 7 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the third city (Meshkinshahr). The use of the other methods (such as Mehta Index and Entropy Index) also gives the same results. On the whole, the urban hierarchy in urban network of Ardabil province has been unbalanced but moving to be balanced during this period. Providing equal opportunities for every city of the province and presenting better services in small cities could help the optimal spatial hierarchy in this province.
