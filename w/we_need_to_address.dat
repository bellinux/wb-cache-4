500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

Factor such as increased socio-economic inequality, movement of people across national boundaries, and refugees, creates major challenges for local communities and schools. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that teaching and leadership are informed by the best available knowledge to meet these challenges.

In the analysis the role the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has in setting the agenda in educational research is problematized and methodological shortcomings within research traditions focusing on successful school leadership are mentioned.

This compound is of pharmacogenetic interest because one of its biological effects in mice - impairment of spermatogenesis, leading to male infertility - depends greatly on the genetic background of the animal. In susceptible mice, administration of NB-DNJ perturbs {{the formation of an}} organelle, the acrosome, in early post-meiotic male germ cells. In all recipient mice, irrespective of reproductive phenotype, NB-DNJ has a similar biochemical effect: inhibition of the glucosylceramidase beta-glucosidase 2 and subsequent elevation of glucosylceramide, a glycosphingolipid. The questions that <b>we</b> now <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> are: how can glucosylceramide specifically affect early acrosome formation, and why is this contingent on genetic factors?
