25|$|This {{instrument}} {{contains a}} suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of Titan's atmosphere. Accelerometers measured forces in all three axes as the probe descended through the atmosphere. With the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known, {{it was possible to}} determine the density of Titan's atmosphere and to detect wind gusts. The probe was designed so that {{in the event of a}} landing on a liquid surface, its motion due to waves would also have been measurable. Temperature and pressure sensors measured the thermal properties of the atmosphere. The Permittivity and Electromagnetic <b>Wave</b> <b>Analyzer</b> component measured the electron and ion (i.e., positively charged particle) conductivities of the atmosphere and searched for electromagnetic wave activity. On the surface of Titan, the electrical conductivity and permittivity (i.e., the ratio of electric displacement field to its electric field) of the surface material was measured. The HASI subsystem also contains a microphone, which was used to record any acoustic events during probe's descent and landing; this was the first time in history that audible sounds from another planetary body had been recorded.|$|E

Thus, no contradictions exist between the ISEE 3 and Ulysses/Galileo observation, and no evidence exists against ES decay in the published Ulysses and Galileo data.

Methods: Using an automatic <b>wave</b> form <b>analyzer,</b> heart-femoral (hf) and brachial-ankle (ba) PWVs were measured simultaneously in 364 subjects (age, 44. 8 ± 9. 3 years).

Results: By univariate analysis, the individual components of the MS, except for a low HDL-cholesterol level, were associated with increased hfPWV and baPWV. Hypercholesterolemia was also associated with increase in both PWVs. A low HDL-cholesterol level was associated with an increased baPWV. However, by multivariate analysis, none of the components of the MS, except for an elevated blood pressure (BP), was an independent factor affecting hfPWV and baPWV. After controlling for age and gender, hfPWV and baPWV were increased according to the number of MS components present (p< 0. 001 for both). After controlling for age, gender and BP, the MS was associated with an increased baPWV (p< 0. 05).
