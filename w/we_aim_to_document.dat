Methods: The pediatric age-specific rates of influenza A hospitalization in Hong Kong for 2004 – 2011 which encompassed the emergence of H 1 N 1 pdm 09 were extrapolated from admissions to 2 hospitals that together catered for 72. 5 % of all pediatric admissions on Hong Kong Island. Influenza A was detected by immunofluorescence, culture and/or PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: Influenza A caused high rates of hospitalization in children with year to year fluctuations. The highest hospitalization burden was seen with H 1 N 1 pdm 09 in 2009. Additional factors affecting hospitalization were the proportion of viral circulation among different subtypes, and antigenic drifts.

40|$|International audienceThe {{anticoagulant}} rodenticide bromadiolone {{is widely}} used as plant protection product to control Water vole outbreaks in European grasslands. Following a treatment, vole population declines rapidly and reaches very low density 3 weeks after bait applications. Then, the plot could be recolonized by voles coming from surrounding plots. When buried in artificial galleries, the persistence of bromadiolone in baits has been showed to be short (DT 50 ~ 3 to 6 days). However, baits may be stored in cavities by voles, which increases dramatically the persistence of bromadiolone in the environment (DT 50 from 25 to 43 days, Sage et al. 2007, Environ. Pollut. 147). In this study, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> the exposure to bromadiolone of Water voles recolonizing a plot several months after a treatment.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the {{ultimate}} output signal of an intricate network of neuroendocrine factors that, acting on the pituitary, trigger gonadotropin release. In turn, gonadopropins exert their trophic action on the gonads to stimulate the synthesis of sex steroids thus completing the gonadotropic axis through feedback regulatory mechanisms of GnRH release. These feedback loops are predominantly inhibitory in both sexes, leading to tonic pulsatile release of GnRH from puberty onwards. However, in the female, rising levels of estradiol along the estrous cycle evoke an additional positive feedback that prompts a surge-like pattern of GnRH release prior to ovulation. Kisspeptins, secreted from hypothalamic Kiss 1 neurons, are poised as major conduits to regulate this dual secretory pathway. Kiss 1 neurons are diverse in origin, nature and function, convening distinct neuronal populations in two main hypothalamic nuclei: the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV). Recent studies from our group and others point out Kiss 1 neurons in the ARC as the plausible generator of GnRH pulses through a system of pulsatile kisspeptin release shaped by the coordinated action of neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin A (Dyn) that are co-expressed in Kiss 1 neurons (so-called KNDy neurons). In this review, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> the recent findings and working models directed towards {{the identification of the}} Kiss 1 -dependent mechanisms of GnRH release through a synoptic overview of the state-of-the-art in the field...|$|E
40|$|Background: Surgical {{conditions}} {{are responsible for}} a significant burden of the disease prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is a paucity of data surrounding the amount and availability of surgical care. Few surveys exist that document current rates of surgical activity in the low-income setting, and most figures rely on the country estimates. <b>We</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> accurately the rates of surgery at the district level. Methods: We performed a retrospective survey of surgical activity in 10 hospitals in the Southern Nation and Nationalities Peoples' Region of Ethiopia using a standardized data collection form. We also performed structured interviews with hospital directors. Results: Surgical output varied across the hospitals from 56 to 421 operations per year per 100, 000 catchment population. The most commonly performed operation was cesarean section (29 % of major procedures). Emergency surgery accounted for 55 % of operations, with the most frequent emergency operation being cesarean section. The overall cesarean section rate was alarmingly low at 0. 6 %. There are only 76 health workers that are providing a surgical service to this sample population of 12. 9 million people. Conclusions: The rates of surgery found here were very low, consistent with the huge shortage of health workers providing a surgical service. The low cesarean section rate indicates {{that there is a}} large unmet surgical disease burden at the population level, and more comprehensive surveys are required to investigate this further. The most important steps to tackle the problem of deficiencies in global surgery are to increase access to surgical care and the surgical workforce capacity. © Société Internationale de Chirurgie 2012...|$|E

METHODS: The present study is based on a retrospective review of surgical case logs at five Partners in Health and Zanmi Lasante hospitals in central Haiti. Data were collected from June 30, 2009, through July 29, 2010, and included patient demographics, disease processes, interventions required, surgeon name, and surgeon training (urologic trained versus non-urologic trained). RESULTS: Urologic surgical disease comprised 498 / 5, 539 (9. 0 %) of all surgical cases in central Haiti from July 2009 -July 2010. A total of 492 diagnoses and 498 urologic procedures on 469 patients were recorded. Most common diagnoses included hydrocele (33. 3 %), phimosis (23. 0 %), benign prostatic hyperplasia (10. 8 %), and cryptorchidism (7. 3 %). Hydrocelectomy was the most commonly performed procedure (160 / 498, 32. 1 %), followed by circumcision (117 / 498, 23. 4 %) and open prostatectomy (38 / 498, 7. 6 %). Surgeon training (urologic versus non-urologic) was determined for 360 / 498 (72. 3 %) of surgical cases. Urologic trained surgeons performed 55 / 360 (15. 3 %) of all surgical procedures. Among patients who underwent prostatectomy, urology surgeons performed 14 / 31 (45. 2 %) of open prostatectomies, and non-urology surgeons performed 17 / 31 (54. 8 %). Urologists performed all transurethral resections of the prostate (9 vs. 0; p = 0. 0051).

40|$|AIM : Beta {{diversity}} {{describes the}} variation in species composition between sites {{and can be used}} to infer why different species occupy different parts of the globe. It can be viewed in a number of ways. First, it can be partitioned into two distinct patterns: turnover and nestedness. Second, it can be investigated from either a species identity or a functional-trait point of view. <b>We</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> for the first time how these two aspects of beta diversity vary in response to a large environmental gradient. LOCATION : Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains, southern Africa. METHODS : We sampled ant assemblages along an extensive elevational gradient (900 – 3000 m a. s. l.) twice yearly for 7 years, and collected functional-trait information related to the species’ dietary and habitat-structure preferences. We used recently developed methods to partition species and functional beta diversity into their turnover and nestedness components. A series of null models were used to test whether the observed beta diversity patterns differed from random expectations. RESULTS : Species beta diversity was driven by turnover, but functional beta diversity was composed of both turnover and nestedness patterns at different parts of the gradient. Null models revealed that deterministic processes were likely to be responsible for the species patterns but that the functional changes were indistinguishable from stochasticity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS : Different ant species are found with increasing elevation, but they tend to represent an increasingly nested subset of the available functional strategies. This finding is unique and narrows down the list of possible factors that control ant existence across elevation. We conclude that diet and habitat preferences have little role in structuring ant assemblages in montane environments and that some other factor must be driving the non-random patterns of species turnover. This finding also highlights the importance of distinguishing between different kinds of beta diversity. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Mazda Wildlife Fund. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> {{the history of}} aeolian {{processes}} within the southern Sahara {{as part of the}} INQUA Dune Atlas. We review available luminescence ages for sand dunes across the southern Sahara to develop an improved understanding of the dune chronology on a regional basis and attempt to correlate periods of sand accumulation. This was achieved by analysing dune age by country, as well as by latitude and longitude. The results show a very patchy spatial distribution of dune ages with large gaps that encompass some of the largest sand seas. Despite these gaps, some related patterns in dune morphology and stratigraphy appear to be consistent between northern Nigeria and southern Mali where older linear dunes are distinct from younger Late Holocene transverse and barchanoid dunes. Elsewhere in Mauretania linear dunes with different orientations appear to have accumulated at different times, most likely in response to changes in atmospheric circulation. Regional climatic changes are identified where dunes are transgressed by lake deposits within endorehic basins. We identify four locations where dune accumulation is terminated by lacustrine transgressions, two of which, in Lake Chad and the Bodélé Depression, occur shortly after the last glacial maximum (LGM). The third example at Gobiero in Niger occurred later, in the early Holocene, around 8. 4 ka and a fourth marks a later transgression of Palaeolake MegaChad after 4. 7 ka. Larger-scale latitudinal and longitudinal distributions in dune ages across the southern Sahara do not show any consistent patterns, though {{this may be due to}} the small sample size relative to the study area. In addition, local variations in external controls such as wind regime, rainfall, vegetation and sand supply need to be considered, sometimes on a site by site basis. Limiting the analysis to dune ages determined using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol indicates a lack of dune preservation during the LGM and the Younger Dryas, times associated with increased dust input to the oceans which is assumed to indicate increased aeolian activity. The SAR dune dates suggest that preservation of dunes at the onset of succeeding humid intervals is an important component of the dune record. The most striking examples of this phenomenon occur where dunes are preserved within endorehic basins by lacustrine transgressions...|$|E

Taxonomy and ecology, two fundamental sciences that generate the knowledge about biodiversity, are associated with a number of limitations that prevent them from providing the information needed to fully understand the relevance of biodiversity in its entirety for human sustainability: (1) biodiversity conservation strategies that tend to be overly focused on research and policy on a global scale with little impact on local biodiversity; (2) the small knowledge base of extant global biodiversity; (3) a lack of much-needed site-specific data on the species composition of communities in human-dominated landscapes, which hinders ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation; (4) biodiversity studies with a lack of taxonomic precision; (5) a lack of taxonomic expertise and trained taxonomists; (6) a taxonomic bottleneck in biodiversity inventory and assessment; and (7) neglect of taxonomic resources and a lack of taxonomic service infrastructure for biodiversity science. These limitations are directly related to contemporary trends in research, conservation strategies, environmental stewardship, environmental education, sustainable development, and local site-specific conservation. Today’s biological knowledge is built on the known global biodiversity, which represents barely 20 % of what is currently extant (commonly accepted estimate of 10 million species) on planet Earth. Much remains unexplored and unknown, particularly in hotspots regions of Africa, South Eastern Asia, and South and Central America, including many developing or underdeveloped countries, where localized biodiversity is scarcely studied or described. ‘‘Backyard biodiversity’’, defined as local biodiversity near human habitation, refers to the natural resources and capital for ecosystem services at the grassroots level, which urgently needs to be explored, documented, and conserved as it is the backbone of sustainable economic development in these countries. Beginning with early identification and documentation of local flora and fauna, taxonomy has documented global biodiversity and natural history based on the collection of ‘‘backyard biodiversity’’ specimens worldwide. However, this branch of science suffered a continuous decline {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century, and has now reached a point of potential demise. At present there are very few professional taxonomists and trained local parataxonomists worldwide, while the need for, and demands on, taxonomic services by conservation and resource management communities are rapidly increasing. Systematic collections, the material basis of biodiversity information, have been neglected and abandoned, particularly at institutions of higher learning. Considering the rapid increase in the human population and urbanization, human sustainability requires new conceptual and practical approaches to refocusing and energizing the study of the biodiversity that is the core of natural resources for sustainable development and biotic capital for sustaining our life-support system. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> and extrapolate the essence of biodiversity, discuss the state and nature of taxonomic demise, the trends of recent biodiversity studies, and suggest reasonable approaches to a biodiversity science to facilitate the expansion of global biodiversity knowledge and to create useful data on backyard biodiversity worldwide towards human sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} infection (STI) {{service delivery}} {{in the context}} of integrated care and the South African HIV epidemic is complex. <b>We</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> STI care and HIV testing processes in public health clinics in South Africa, revealing bottlenecks to patient flow and identifying opportunities for improvement. Clinic mapping, with semi-structured interviews and clinic observation, was conducted with facility representatives at three clinical sentinel surveillance sites. Facility surveys assessed patient volume and staffing. Identified challenges were associated with staffing allocations, and disruptions in patient flow resulted from poor clinic layout, inadequate lighting, and limited allocation of space for HIV testing and physical examination. Recommendations include staffing adjustments, reorganization of space to allow for designated service and waiting areas, sufficient supplies, and improved lighting. The facility reorganization component of South Africa's Ideal Clinic initiative provides a key opportunity for enacting many of these recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Objectives <b>We</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> our {{experience}} with oral clonidine when {{used as a}} sedative in combination with intravenous morphine and lorazepam {{in a group of}} mechanically ventilated children with single-organ, respiratory failure. In particular, our objectives were to establish the relationship between oral dose, plasma concentration, and sedative effect, and second, <b>to</b> <b>document</b> the side-effect profile. Design Prospective, cohort study over a 72 -h period. Setting Regional paediatric intensive care unit. Patients and participants Twenty-four children were enrolled (median age 3 months) of whom ten were excluded (six due to extubation before 72 h, three sedation failures, one protocol violation). Measurements and results Plasma clonidine was measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry, and sedation assessed using the COMFORT score. Using a dose of 3 – 5 mgrg/kg every 8 h, plasma concentrations appeared to plateau at approximately 41 h giving a mean value of 1. 38 ng/ml (95...|$|R
40|$|International audienceProboscis {{extension}} reflex conditioning {{has often}} been used to study olfactory learning in the honey bee. However, only {{a few studies have}} explored the variability of this response relative to the age of the bees, and these studies have yielded different conclusions. <b>We</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>document</b> the effect of age on the proboscis extension response by measuring three parameters in the experimental procedure: the level of spontaneous responses, the acquisition rate, and the resistance to extinction. The performance of the youngest bees (2 -day and 4 -day-old) differed from those of older individuals for the three parameters, which {{may be related to the}} ontogeny of the olfactory system. In older age-groups, only the resistance to extinction was found to vary with age. We discuss the possible relationships between age-dependent variations in the odour learning abilities and the division of labour in the colony...|$|R
