25|$|After {{the basic}} king, bishop, and knight versus king {{position}} arrived, White {{was kind enough}} to allow his king to retreat to the last rank in only six moves. But Black seemed to try to mate White in the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner.</b> Black eventually found a winning line, up to a point, but then failed to find 156... Nb4+ and instead tried again to mate in the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you ever}} come back I'll tell you," [...] laughed Rose as he danced away into the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner,</b> bumped smartly against another gentleman, and {{returned}} as soberly {{as if that was}} the proper figure.|$|R
2500|$|... "Morales is {{dancing in}} the opening seconds but is that because he's got a second wind or because he still doesn't know where he is. He did head to the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner</b> {{at the end of}} the last round.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for loss: Their mass-marketing {{strategy}} {{did not pay}} off, {{and they}} didn't sell nearly enough flowers {{to have a chance}} of victory. While their shop was well-decorated, their promotional scheme had a terrible idea of hiring the women selling flowers not only with their Dutch tacky outfits, but they were stood in the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner</b> of the street. They only had a profit of $969.|$|R
50|$|Pierce {{defeated}} Carlos Eduardo Rocha on June 8, 2012 at UFC on FX 3 by unanimous decision. After {{a dominant}} performance by Pierce, initially 2 judges scored the fight 30-27 for Pierce, while the 3rd judge inexplicably scored it 30-27 for Rocha. However, {{it was later}} announced that the judge, Ric Bays, had scored the fight for the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner</b> and he had actually won unanimously.|$|R
5000|$|I {{was at the}} Jazz Festival in New Orleans, in {{this bar}} {{watching}} a Cuban band, {{with a friend of}} mine. We were the last ones there. We walked out and we just went around the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner.</b> It happened really fast. There were two guys. They had a gun on my friend and they cut me, and took our wallets. I was bleeding pretty badly. When I went to the hospital, the doctor said, [...] "I don't think this is very good; three of your fingers might be paralyzed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rocha next faced Mike Pierce on June 8, 2012 at UFC on FX 3. As well as {{moving to}} Black House {{to train for}} the fight, Rocha claimed {{that this was the}} first time in his career that he had a full {{training}} camp leading up to a fight.

5000|$|Garcia's next {{fight was}} a rematch against Ring Top 10 Light Welterweight, Erik Morales. The fight {{took place on}} October 20, l2012, in Brooklyn. Danny Garcia {{retained}} his WBC, WBA (Super) & The Ring Light Welterweight title's by knocking out Erik Morales with a thunderous left hook in the fourth round. Here is how FOX Sports described how Danny Garcia knocked out Erik Morales:TV [...] "Morales is dancing in the opening seconds, but is that because he's got a second wind or because he still doesn't know where he is? He did head to the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner</b> {{at the end of}} the last round.|$|R
2500|$|Anatoly Karpov lost an endgame with a pawn versus two knights to Veselin Topalov {{although}} he had a theoretical draw with a pawn past the Troitsky line; because of its rarity, Karpov seemed not to know the theory of drawing {{and headed for the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>corner.</b> [...] (Depending on the position of the pawn, checkmate can be forced only in certain corners [...]) [...] In this [...] "rapid play" [...] time control, the position in the game was initially a draw, but Karpov made a bad move which resulted in a lost position. [...] Topalov later made a bad move, making the position a draw, but Karpov made another bad move, resulting in a lost position again.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2012, while Kick-Ass 2 {{was still}} in {{pre-production}} Mark Millar stated that a third film was also planned. In June 2013, however, he revealed {{that it was not}} confirmed and would be dependent on how successful the second film was. Later the same month he further elaborated that if it went ahead, the third film would be the final installment: [...] "Kick-Ass 3 {{is going to be the}} last one... I told Universal this and they asked me, ‘What does that mean?’ I said, ‘It means that this is where it all ends.’ They said, ‘Do they all die at the end?’ I said, ‘Maybe’ - because this is a realistic superhero story... if someone doesn't have a bullet proof vest like Superman, and doesn't have Batman’s millions, then eventually he is going to turn around the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner</b> and get his head kicked in or get shot in the face. So Kick-Ass needs to reflect that. There has to be something dramatic at the end; he cannot do this for the rest of his life." ...|$|R
25|$|Open {{and closed}} {{positions}} are considered separately in the following. If Black opts not {{to step into}} a closed position, phase 1 will necessarily drive him to a <b>wrong</b> colour <b>corner,</b> when phase 2 will be necessary. If Black steps into a closed position, phase 2 doesn't apply, but the completion of phase 1 in the resulting position may lead {{into one of the}} lines shown for phase 2 under open positions.|$|R
40|$|There’s an {{old joke}} about a drunk {{searching for his}} car keys at the <b>wrong</b> street <b>corner</b> late one night. When asked why, he {{explains}} that it’s better lit than the right one. The multimedia authoring research agenda today, like the drunk’s search, has been unduly influenced by “where the light is. ” To push the analogy a bit further, the field is searching for the “keys”—the proverbial killer application—under the “light ” of a large corpus of available (that is, network newscast or sports) footage. We believe that multimedia’s killer app might already be at hand—and it’s focused around audio and video clips. But researchers aren’t addressing critical open research issues becaus...|$|R
50|$|In the {{remaining}} combinations of material, bishop and champion, champion and wizard, bishop and knight, and knight and wizard, {{the requirement for}} winning is that the enemy king should be {{kept out of the}} <b>wrong</b> colored <b>corner</b> since the knight alone, or the champion alone cannot defeat the king. Having met this requirement, the mating technique for bishop and champion, and wizard and champion are fairly straightforward, while the technique for bishop and knight is somewhat more complicated. As for knight and wizard, it is possible to set up positions in which the enemy king is corralled, leading to checkmate, but there doesn't seem to be a way of forcing these positions.|$|R
50|$|Open {{and closed}} {{positions}} are considered separately in the following. If Black opts not {{to step into}} a closed position, phase 1 will necessarily drive him to a <b>wrong</b> colour <b>corner,</b> when phase 2 will be necessary. If Black steps into a closed position, phase 2 doesn't apply, but the completion of phase 1 in the resulting position may lead {{into one of the}} lines shown for phase 2 under open positions. Mate is usually quicker from closed positions, , so White should usually try to close open positions and Black to avoid closure, but this is a fine balance. In position J (below), Black does equally well playing into a closed or an open position.|$|R
2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner.</b> Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|R
40|$|We used {{a variant}} of the Stroop task in which {{subjects}} re-ported whether a spatial preposition word (ABOVE, BELOW) was above or below a cross. The word’s position either con-flicted or agreed with its meaning (which subjects were in-structed to ignore). • We measured the trajectory of the mouse as the subject moved the cursor {{from the bottom of the}} screen to the appro-priate answer location to register the response. Trajectories are a continuous measure of stimulus processing; when the word’s position and its meaning conflicted, the response path could de-viate toward the <b>wrong</b> <b>corner</b> before finally reaching the correct corner. • This deviation was reflected in the direction of movement at each point in time, and it revealed when the subject made his or her choice between the two responses; a moment in time we propose to call the decision time. This decision time was 356 ms after onset of the word in the congruent condition, com-pared to 529 ms in the incongruent condition. In contrast, the final response times did not show a significant conflict effect, suggesting that response trajectories are a more sensitive measure. • We conclude that spatial prepositions give rise to conflict like colour words do in a classic Stroop task, and that this conflict happens roughly between 350 ms and 550 ms after word onset. Spatial Stroop SUBJECTS were presented the word ABOVE or BELOW, whichthey were told to ignore. The task was to report whether an X that appeared 200 ms later was above or below the word. To ensure that the subject keeps reading the word (which is task–irrelevant) we interleaved these location trials with a second, name task. Here, instead of the X an O appeared and the sub-ject is asked to report the word, ignoring the position of the O. However, we omit further analysis of these name trials. Furthermore, the word is given a processing advantage by ap-pearing 200 ms before the location information. Response measurement WE measure not only what response the subject made andwhen, but also how. In every trial, the subject clicked in the bottom of the screen and responded by moving the cursor to one of the two answers that were presented in the corners of the screen...|$|R
2500|$|Upon its release, Talk Dirty {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At USA Today, Martin Caballero rated the album {{two out of}} four stars, stating that Derulo is [...] "wallow in familiar sexed-up tropes, both lyrically and musically, that aren't distinctive enough to ultimately prove memorable." [...] Caballero continued saying [...] "Talk Dirty sounds like Macklemore's Thrift Shop on Red Bull and Viagra". Brent Faulkner of StarPulse.com rated the album three out of five stars, stating that the album heavily relies on sex and swagger holds the album back at times. Faulkner went on to summarize the album as [...] "average at best" [...] stating [...] " [...] seems to put its eggs too much into one basket – specifically booty. Much like Derülo’s Future History, Talk Dirty seems to lack cohesion; it’s missing something". Glenn Gamboa at Newsday graded the album a C, saying that Derulo [...] "tries too hard at the <b>wrong</b> things... <b>cornering</b> the market on sex-themed pop songs." [...] in closing Gambo called Talk Dirty a [...] "sex-obsessed album that isn't very sexy".|$|R
5000|$|Alexander Wurz was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session, one tenth faster than Mondini and two tenths faster than third fastest, Juan Pablo Montoya. Wurz was very pleased with his performance in practice, [...] "I went through my tyre choice and I {{have to say the}} way the circuit is progressing, it is coming to us just as it did at the Nurburgring, which is good. This makes me quite confident and positive that we will have a good weekend" [...] he said. Anthony Davidson had dislodged a marker stick in the [...] "Swimming Pool" [...] to cause the red flag {{at the start of the}} session. After the restart, Davidson got his entry to the [...] "Ste Devote" [...] <b>corner</b> <b>wrong</b> and understeered into the tyre wall, removing the Honda’s front wing and left front wheel.|$|R
50|$|The November 2002 anniversary siege {{began with}} four armed drug dealers, having taken a <b>wrong</b> turn, <b>cornered</b> {{in the small}} cul-de-sac. In desperation, they raided some houses on the Close to take cover and took many {{residents}} hostage in their homes. These were highly graphic and violent scenes and signalled {{the end of the}} relatively low-key, character-led storylines of 2002 - these highly dramatic episodes were designed to shock: in the storyline, teenagers Ali and Kirsty Gordon were violently terrorised at gunpoint in number 5, Steve Murray was shot and dumped unconscious outside the front door of number 9, Nikki Shadwick was almost raped (again), and her sister, Emily O'Leary, fell to her death from an upstairs window of number 10, terrified and desperately trying to escape. Marty Murray was beaten and locked in a cupboard, there was the implied rape of Kirsty Gordon, blatant abuse of the drug cocaine, extremely strong language, and a realistic portrayal of a deranged, drug addicted bank robber called Terry 'Psycho' Gibson by Greg Milburn. The siege ran over several episodes and culminated the following week in a spectacular stunt involving a police helicopter which was gunned down by Gibson and then spectacularly crashed onto the Brookside Parade car park, exploded, and instantly killed-off the popular character Diane Murray. The stunt was vaguely reminiscent of the plane crash storyline in Emmerdale, which Redmond had himself devised for that flagging series in 1993, with the storyline now praised as saving the series from cancellation. However, the helicopter crash could not save Brookside and the storyline was ultimately criticised as being completely unrealistic and ultimately unsuitable for pre-watershed viewing and, in particular, during the Saturday evening omnibus, broadcast from 16:30. The storyline did, however, provide some extremely dramatic sequences, were well acted and were technically of a high quality, but with no promotion whatsoever by Channel 4, they barely made a ripple in the ratings.|$|R
25|$|On another {{modeling}} shoot, Erica has {{an accident}} and suffers injuries to her back. With the help of Dr. Jonathan Kinder, she becomes addicted to the medication she takes for her injury. Dimitri tries to warn her about Jonathan, but she will not listen, thus putting a strain on their marriage again. While {{under the influence of}} the increasingly higher doses of drugs Jonathan gives her, Erica has sex with him. Her dependence on her supplier grows until she finally has to admit she has an addiction and checks herself into the Betty Ford Center. Once she is out, Erica and Dimitri start finding their way back to each other. This does not sit well with Jonathan. The doctor drugs Erica and tricks Dimitri into thinking they are still sleeping together. After seeing his wife in bed with another man, Dimitri files for divorce and finds comfort with an equally as devastated Maria Santos Grey. Erica has no idea what Jonathan did or why Dimitri is angry with her. Dimitri shuts her out and refuses to explain why he divorced her. Erica does not find out what happened until she and her new friends Janet Green and Skye Chandler (each of whom was <b>wronged</b> by Kinder) <b>corner</b> Jonathan and he confesses. He gets the upper hand on the women and is about to assault Erica when Dimitri comes to her rescue. Jonathan is sent to prison.|$|R
5000|$|When {{practice}} resumed, Stewart {{went out}} on the track in his car on a personal fact-finding mission. His conclusion was that his own preference was to take The Esses complex in fourth gear in the Tyrrell, hence he would be {{at the low end of}} the engine's rev range, making the car more tractable and less nervous (in exchange for a bit less throttle response). Cevert, however, preferred to use third gear and be at the top end of his engine's power range: it was always something of a compromise because of the need to accelerate through the combination of corners. Stewart noted that the Tyrrell always felt jumpy through this section of the Watkins Glen track owing to its short wheelbase; he felt that this was somewhat counteracted by driving in the higher gear even though this meant a time penalty if he got his line <b>wrong</b> through the <b>corner.</b> A film documentary of the time, shot minutes before the start of the fatal practice session, captures Stewart and Cevert in a spirited debate on exactly this point. Another accident occurred at the same circuit a year later in the 1974 USA Grand Prix when another young Formula One driver, Helmuth Koinigg, died when his car went straight into the barrier at turn 7. As a response to Cevert's and Koinigg's accidents, a chicane was added in 1975 in order to slow the cars through the [...] "Esses". The chicane was removed in 1985 after the track lost its Formula One race in 1981.|$|R
