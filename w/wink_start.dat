50|$|This example shows a T1 trunk using E&M <b>wink</b> <b>start</b> {{signaling}} only. Other {{methods can}} be used, although {{this was the}} most common in 20th century private circuits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wink</b> <b>start</b> is used {{to notify}} the remote side or PBX that it can send the Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS), also {{referred}} to as the Called Number. Automatic Number Identification (ANI) can also be transmitted.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wink</b> <b>Start</b> - {{when the}} {{originator}} goes off hook, {{the other end}} transmits a short (140-290ms) off-hook signal and returns to on-hook. The originator detects the wink and then sends the dialed digits. The other end goes permanently off-hook (seized) when the call is answered.|$|E
5000|$|Wink {{attended}} the University of Wisconsin and played {{quarterback for the}} 1942 Wisconsin Badgers football team. The following season, he played at the University of Michigan as a marine trainee. <b>Wink</b> <b>started</b> two games as quarterback for the 1943 Michigan Wolverines. [...] After World War II, he returned to Wisconsin, lettering for the 1946 and 1947 Wisconsin football teams. As a senior in 1947, he was named the team's honorary captain at a postseason banquet.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 {{he started}} touring {{worldwide}} for the Grammy Award winning group Digable Planets {{for two years}} with a three-month opening slot with Sade. In 1994 Britt and Josh <b>Wink</b> <b>started</b> the label Ovum Recordings. Their first release was a collaboration between King and wordsmith/singer Ursula Rucker called Supernatural. The song {{went on to become}} a staple tune in the US rave scene and is revered as a classic in many countries. Ovum Recordings is still in operation but King resigned from his position in 2001.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} so,' replied Sam, with a patronising <b>wink.</b> 'Queer <b>start</b> that 'ere, {{but he was}} one too many for you, warn't he? Up to snuff and a pinch or two over--eh?' ...|$|R
50|$|Using MF signaling, the {{originating}} {{telephone switching}} office sends a starting signal {{such as a}} seizure (off-hook) by toggling the AB bits. After the initial seizure, the terminating office acknowledges a ready state by responding with a wink (short duration seizure) and then goes back on-hook (<b>wink</b> <b>start).</b> The originating office sends the destination digits to the terminating switch.|$|E
5000|$|In {{telephone}} switching systems, wink pulsing is recurring pulsing {{in which the}} off-condition is relatively short compared to the on-condition. In <b>Wink</b> <b>start</b> trunks, the exchange at the originating end sends an off-hook to alert to a call. The terminating end indicates readiness to receive the dialed telephone number by sending an off-hook of approximately half a second duration, or [...] "wink". Upon receiving this go ahead signal, the originating end uses multi-frequency or other address signalling to send the phone number.|$|E

50|$|Wink was {{influenced}} {{early in his}} education when he attended an experimental elementary school located in the Teachers College at Columbia University. The school focused on creative writing and scientific exploration, rather than a rigid adherence to a standard curriculum. This helped shape what would become Wink’s lifelong commitment to creativity, following his passion for artistic exploration. After attending high school at the Fieldston School, Wink majored in American Studies at Wesleyan University with a concentration in art history and pop culture. It was at Wesleyan that <b>Wink</b> <b>started</b> drumming. After graduation, Wink played drums by night with post-punk bands. A full-time job as a cater-waiter at Glorious Foods followed, where he worked with longtime friend Phil Stanton.|$|R

[...] With Paul White, Bill Daley and Merv Pregulman lost to military service, Michigan was required to substantially revamp its lineup. [...] Bob Wiese moved from quarterback to fullback, Jack <b>Wink</b> became the <b>starting</b> quarterback, and Robert Derleth took over Pregulman's spot at right tackle.

60|$|I spent a {{great part}} of that night making entries in my note-book, by the light of our camp-fires, while my companions slept. And, truly, I enjoyed such quiet hours after days of so great mental and {{physical}} excitement. I observed, also, that the negroes enjoyed those seasons exceedingly. They sat round the blaze, talking and laughing, and recounting, I have no doubt, their feats of daring by flood and field; then, when they began to grow sleepy, they sat there swaying to and fro, making an occasional remark, until they became too sleepy even for that, when they began to nod and <b>wink</b> and <b>start,</b> and almost fell into the fire, so unwilling did they seem to tear themselves away from it, even for the distance of the few feet they required to draw back in order to enable them to lie down. At last nature could hold out no longer, and one by one they dropped back in their places.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{knew not}} what to say. Mr. Vigours had evidently been {{driven out of}} Falesá by the machinations of Case and with {{something}} not very unlike the collusion of my pastor. I called to mind it was Namu who had reassured me about Adams and traced the rumour to the ill-will of the priest. And I saw I must inform myself more thoroughly from an impartial source. There is an old rascal of a chief here, Faiaso, whom I dare say you saw to-day at the council; he has been all his life turbulent and sly, a great fomenter of rebellions, and a thorn {{in the side of}} the mission and the island. For all that he is very shrewd, and, except in politics or about his own misdemeanours, a teller of the truth. I went to his house, told him what I had heard, and besought him to be frank. I do not think I had ever a more painful interview. Perhaps you will understand me, Mr. Wiltshire, if I tell you that I am perfectly serious in these old wives’ tales with which you reproached me, and as anxious to do well for these islands as you can be to please and to protect your pretty wife. And you are to remember that I thought Namu a paragon, and was proud of the man as one of the first ripe fruits of the mission. And now I was informed that he had fallen in a sort of dependence upon Case. The beginning of it was not corrupt; it began, doubtless, in fear and respect, produced by trickery and pretence; but I was shocked to find that another element had been lately added, that Namu helped himself in the store, and was believed to be deep in Case’s debt. Whatever the trader said, that Namu believed with trembling. He was not alone in this; many in the village lived in a similar subjection; but Namu’s case was the most influential, it was through Namu Case had wrought most evil; and with a certain following among the chiefs, and the pastor in his pocket, the man was as good as master of the village. You know something of Vigours and Adams, but perhaps you have never heard of old Underhill, Adams’ predecessor. He was a quiet, mild old fellow, I remember, and we were told he had died suddenly: white men die very suddenly in Falesá. The truth, as I now heard it, made my blood run cold. It seems he was struck with a general palsy, all of him dead but one eye, which he continually <b>winked.</b> Word was <b>started</b> that the helpless old man was now a devil, and this vile fellow Case worked upon the natives’ fears, which he professed to share, and pretended he durst not go into the house alone. At last a grave was dug, and the living body buried at the far end of the village. Namu, my pastor, whom I had helped to educate, offered up a prayer at the hateful scene.|$|R
