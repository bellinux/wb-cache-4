5|$|The {{city has}} {{frequent}} bus connections to {{other cities in}} Jordan, {{as well as to}} major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theatre in the city centre. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>around</b> in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.|$|E
5|$|In Wings of Liberty, Narud and the Moebius Foundation backed Tychus Findlay's {{contact with}} James Raynor as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>around</b> an {{imperial}} decree from Arcturus Mengsk {{which made it}} illegal to traffic in alien goods. Narud would later appear by proxy as the Moebius Foundation's representative during a mission briefing on Tyrador, wherein Narud lent James Raynor his medical transport ships to help Raynor destroy the foundation's data cores {{in order to prevent}} the Queen of Blades from gaining access to them. On the eve of the invasion of Char, Raynor learned from Valerian that Narud had been working with the Dominion's Crown Prince for the entire duration of the game. In the aftermath of the successful de-infestation of the Queen of Blades, a civil war erupts between Arcturus and Valerian; in an attempt to find a safe haven, Valerian and Raynor seek shelter with the Moebius Foundation. Initially, Narud greeted and temporarily sheltered the group, but after examining the Xel'Naga artifact and thoroughly questioning Raynor about Kerrigan, Narud revealed his allegiance to Arcturus and sold out the group to an incoming Dominion fleet, but the fleet's attempt to kill Kerrigan fails.|$|E

Non-MIO buses round out the system and are used primarily by the working class to get around and are less expensive to use. Buses are secure but not at the same level as taxis.

25|$|Sanctions {{have reduced}} Iran's access to {{products}} {{needed for the}} oil and energy sectors, have prompted many oil companies to withdraw from Iran, and have also caused a decline in oil production due to reduced access to technologies needed to improve their efficiency. According to Undersecretary of State William Burns, Iran may be annually losing as much as $60 billion in energy investment. Many international companies have also been reluctant {{to do business with}} Iran for fear of losing access to larger Western markets. As well as restricting export markets, the sanctions have reduced Iran's oil income by increasing the costs of repatriating revenues in complicated ways that sidestep the sanctions; Iranian analysts estimate the budget deficit for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, which in Iran ends in late March, at between $30bn to $50bn. The effects of U.S. sanctions include expensive basic goods for Iranian citizens, and an aging and increasingly unsafe civil aircraft fleet. According to the Arms Control Association, the international arms embargo against Iran is slowly reducing Iran's military capabilities, largely due to its dependence on Russian and Chinese military assistance. The only substitute is to find compensatory measures requiring more time and money, and which are less effective. According to at least one analyst (Fareed Zakaria), the market for imports in Iran is dominated by state enterprises and state-friendly enterprises, because the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>around</b> the sanctions is smuggling, and smuggling requires strong connections with the government. This has weakened Iranian civil society and strengthened the state.|$|E
500|$|In February 1937, Saville {{paired with}} Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey, Project Officer for Fighters at the USAAC, {{to find a}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>around</b> the USAAC's {{arbitrary}} 500-pound (225kg) limit on the weight of fighter aircraft armament. The two men settled on the term [...] "interceptor", creating a new Army classification for fighters, not a new mission. They issued a specification for two new heavily armed fighters via Circular Proposal X-608 and Circular Proposal X-609. These were requests for fighters having [...] "the tactical mission of interception and attack of hostile aircraft at high altitude". Specifications called for at least [...] of heavy armament including a cannon, one or two liquid-cooled Allison V-1710 engines each with a General Electric turbo-supercharger, tricycle landing gear, a level airspeed of at least [...] at altitude, and a climb to [...] within 6 minutesâ€”the toughest set of specifications USAAC had presented to that date. From these specifications a competition was held, and eventually the single-engine fighter became the Bell Aircraft P-39 Airacobra, and the twin-engine fighter became the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. Saville's rank of captain was made permanent in June 1937.|$|E

2500|$|On June 13, 2008, Silver King {{made his}} debut with AAA, teaming with La Parka (AAA) and Chessman to face La Legion Extranjera (Electro Shock, Bobby Lashley and Kenzo Suzuki) at AAA's Triplemania XVI show. Silver King {{participated in the}} second annual Copa Antonio PeÃ±a tournament Gauntlet match. He was the {{eleventh}} entrant and lost to eventual winner El Mesias. During a television taping on February 7, 2009 Silver King turned on his tag team partners La Parka (AAA) and X-Pac to side with Konnanâ€™s La LegiÃ³n Extranjera. After La LegiÃ³n Extranjera was defeated in the main event of Triplemania XVII and Konnan lost control of AAA, Silver King went on to form the stable Los Wagnermaniacos with Dr. Wagner, Jr., Electroshock, and Ultimo Gladiator. Following Electroshock's AAA Mega Championship win at Rey de Reyes in March 2010, Silver King, Electroshock, and Ultimo Gladiator all turned on Dr. Wagner, Jr. and adopted the new stable name Los Maniacos. In {{the weeks leading up}} to Triplemania XVIII it was announced that the winners of a tag team match between Silver King and Ãšltimo Gladiador against La Hermandad 187 (Nicho and Joe LÃ­der) would be given a chance to wrestle for the AAA World Tag Team Championship at Triplemania XVIII. The match between the two teams ended in a draw, leaving it undecided if both or neither teams will wrestle at Triplemania XVIII. On June 6, 2010, at Triplemania XVIII, Silver King was officially billed as [...] "Silver Cain", both as a reference to the biblical Cain and Abel, as well as a way for AAA to get around him wearing a mask again. The Mexican Boxing and Wrestling Commission had been giving GonzÃ¡lez problems due to the fact that he had previously lost his mask and this was a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>around</b> it since he was allowed to wear a mask under a new character. He would only have to use the new name when wrestling in Mexico City. On that night he and Ãšltimo Gladiador outlasted three other teams, pinning James Storm of Beer Money, Inc. to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship, Silver King's first AAA title. Following the match Los Junior Capos (MÃ¡scara AÃ±o 2000, Jr. and Hijo de Cien Caras) from IWRG came to the ring to challenge the new champions for the title. On June 26, Silver King defeated MÃ¡scara AÃ±o 2000, Jr. to win the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in an AAA/IWRG interpromotional match. Silver King went on to challenge Dr. Wagner, Jr. for the AAA Mega Championship in a threeâ€“way match, which also included Vampiro, on August 15 at Verano de Escandalo, but failed to win the title, when Wagner pinned Vampiro. After the match King played an audio tape, where the late father of the two brothers claimed that King was the more talented of the two of them. This revelation led to a match on October 1 at HÃ©roes Inmortales IV, where Wagner, Jr. defeated Silver King in a singles match to retain the AAA Mega Championship.|$|E

Attempts to cut off communication between the agent, sender, and receiver of information failed because subjects found <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>around</b> blindfolds no matter how intricate and covering they were. In studies at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman, patients were monitored and awakened after a period of REM then separated to study the claimed ability to communicate telepathically.
