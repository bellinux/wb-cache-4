5|$|Most of Demosthenes' major orations were {{directed}} against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357BC, when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna, Athens had been formally {{at war with the}} Macedonians. In 352BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very <b>worst</b> <b>enemy</b> of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the king of Persia.|$|E
5|$|Nan's {{experiences}} eventually reveal serious faults of {{the society}} she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable {{until the end of}} the novel indicates she is her own <b>worst</b> <b>enemy.</b> Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{would not}} {{tolerate}} any power outside Germany—as in Rome—having a say in German affairs. He launched a Kulturkampf ("culture war") against {{the power of the}} pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy. The Catholic element, in turn, saw in the National-Liberals as its <b>worst</b> <b>enemy</b> and formed the Center Party.|$|E

Leggio was charged with ordering Terranova's murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence, both in the first trial, which was held in Reggio Calabria in 1983, and three years later, in 1986, in the appeal process.|$|E

25|$|A more {{authentic}} tradition represents Lysias as having spoken his own Olympiacus at the Olympic festival of 388 BC, to which Dionysius I of Syracuse {{had sent a}} magnificent embassy. Tents embroidered with gold were pitched within the sacred enclosure; and the wealth of Dionysius was vividly shown {{by the number of}} chariots which he had entered. Lysias lifted up his voice to denounce Dionysius as, next to Artaxerxes, the <b>worst</b> <b>enemy</b> of Hellas, and to impress upon the assembled Greeks that one of their foremost duties was to deliver Sicily from a hateful oppression. The latest work of Lysias which we can date (a fragment of a speech For Pherenicus) belongs to 381 or 380 BC. He probably died in or soon after 380 BC.|$|E
25|$|The text {{starts off}} with a prologue (verses 1 through 666). King Ban, Lanzelet’s father, reigns as a tyrant over Genewis, which René Pérennec equates to the Kingdom of Gaunnes. He treats the noblemen in the {{hierarchy}} as he would the common people, and his vassals cannot accept this. They rise against King Ban, destroying the kingdom and killing everyone in the castle. They nonetheless allow Elaine, King Ban's wife, to live as she is known for her kindness. She escapes, while {{the queen of the}} sea-fairies, takes Lanzelet away to raise him on an island inhabited by women. There, he learns how to use weapons just as well as he learns music and song. Lanzelet yearns to know his own name but the fairy refuses to reveal it to him until he has defeated her <b>worst</b> <b>enemy,</b> Iweret. On his journey, Lanzelet meets a dwarf, who whips him, and then a knight named Johfrit de Liez, who teaches him the rudiments of chivalry. In verses 667 to 1356, Lanzelet meets two knights named Kuraus and Orphilet; they enter the house of a woodsman named Galagandreiz. The following night, Lanzelet sleeps with Galandreiz's daughter. Galandreiz, upon finding her in Lanzelet’s bed becomes enraged. He and Lanzelet engage in a battle ending in Galandreiz's death. Lanzelet then marries the woodsman’s daughter and becomes a lord.|$|E

500|$|Feyerabend {{said that}} science {{started as a}} {{liberating}} movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an ideology. Because of this, {{he said it was}} impossible {{to come up with an}} unambiguous way to distinguish science from religion, magic, or mythology. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as authoritarian and ungrounded. Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>enemy</b> of science" [...] from his detractors.|$|E
500|$|Though {{impact from}} the storm was {{expected}} to be fairly minimal, residents were still advised to stock up on emergency supplies and be prepared. Northern Territory Police Commissioner, John McRoberts, urged residents to heed warnings despite the generally non-threatening nature of the storm, [...] "complacency can often be your <b>worst</b> <b>enemy</b> in these types of events." [...] Many stores across Darwin reported a sharp increase in the sales of bottled water due to the storm. Despite the approaching storm, regional airports, schools, and businesses remained open. Ferry service to the Tiwi Islands, however, was suspended for 24November.|$|E
500|$|But Fairley's {{main concern}} was malaria. Despite the {{experience}} with malaria in the Middle East, most of the troops had a poor understanding of anti-malaria precautions and few medical officers had encountered the disease. In combination with critical shortages of drugs and anti-malarial supplies such as netting, insecticides and repellents, {{the result was a}} medical disaster. In the 13-week period from 31 October 1942 to 1 January 1943, the Army reported 4,137 battle casualties, but 14,011 casualties from tropical diseases, of which 12,240 were from malaria.

Derakhshani stated it [...] "rehearses {{virtually}} every element of the classic genre piece: violence, sex and romance, gunplay, spies, betrayals, a femme fatale, and a murderous Gestapo officer". Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters noted that, though he has to deal mainly with [...] "moral questions, Flame confronts an emotional complication—in the conventional form of a woman". Abeel argued that [...] "For beneath his stony exterior, it's Flame's romantic soul that will prove his <b>worst</b> <b>enemy.</b> This masterful film is at once a portrait of wartime heroism and a poignant journey into a boy's secret heart." ...|$|E

500|$|And {{yet despite}} his {{formidable}} record and undoubted {{importance in the}} history of technology, Evans never became a household name. In this respect Evans was his own <b>worst</b> <b>enemy.</b> He was deeply affected by a perceived lack of recognition and appreciation from his peers for his work, and his bouts of depression would lead him to act in the extreme, prematurely ending projects and vowing to give up inventing many times {{over the course of his}} life. In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him, and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative, often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics (such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the Oruktor Amphibolos at the end of his life). While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed force people to pay him his due, the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies. A leading Philadelphia merchant summed it up in 1802, stating [...] "few if any [...] are inclined to give pompous blockhead, Oliver Evans, the credit of inventing any of the useful contrivances in milling for which he now enjoys patents." ...|$|E
