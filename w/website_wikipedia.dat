In this project the interest shown by consumers pre-launch and the level of financial success of the movie over its in-theatre lifetime are studied. Particularly a distinction was made in terms of the timing of consumer pre-launch interest. Using the <b>website</b> <b>Wikipedia</b> as a credible source of product information, it was found that Wikipedia use started to rise exponentially in the final two weeks before movie launch. Moreover, possible predictive correlation between movie success over its lifetime and pre-announcement interest was found to increase in the final 5 weeks before launch, from 0. 5 to 0. 71 two weeks before launch, whereas it stabilized in the final pre-launch weeks and did not get higher than 0. 75 even 3 weeks after release. This indicates that movie success may be best predicted 2 weeks ahead of launch when using pre-announcement information search data...|$|E

Without a doubt students with good vocabulary knowledge master the material faster, communicate their knowledge better and start critical analysis of the discussed material sooner. To emphasize, the point in a fashion that students can easily relate to, I have designed a vocabulary exercise utilizing the popular <b>website</b> <b>Wikipedia.</b> Wikipedia offers non-peer reviewed information in interactive mode. The reader can vary the length {{and the depth of}} the topic being explored by exercising the choice to open or not to open a weblink. Students are asked to time themselves reading a paragraph of Wikipedia with and without opening all weblinks, and to calculate the ratio of the measured times. The reading without opening the weblinks is modeled as reading with knowledge of the vocabulary, whereas the reading with opening of the weblinks was modeled as reading without knowledge of vocabulary. On average, it takes students seven to nine times longer to read the paragraph without vocabulary knowledge, which clearly demonstrates the importance of timely vocabulary learning. The exercise could be executed as an in class assignment, followed by a class discussion or as a homework...|$|E

View of history, nationalism and science.                                                                                                           The study concerns the Swedish, after the conquest of Scania 1658, attempts to induce feelings of Swedish nationality {{to the people in}} former Danish province of Scania 1658 - 1720. The goal {{of this study was to}} analyze 20 th century and present Swedish and Danish historians’ descriptions of the Swedish and Danish treatment of the native Scania population. The aim was further to describe this historians` view of native rebellious group called “snapphanar” and which measures were taken to assimilate the Scanian population to Swedish realm. Lastly, the historians view above concerning a presence of a native Scanian regional or national identity was studied.                I studied writings of three popular historians from Denmark and from Sweden respectively. To compensate for the influence of nationalism on historiography, sources from three periods during the 20 th and the current century was used.                                             In the attempt to reach these main goals I have analyzed the authors’ books and the Swedish and Danish versions of the <b>website</b> <b>Wikipedia.</b> All the popular historians´ mean that the people of Scania felt national identity, except Åberg which mean that they also had a regional identity. The Swedish scholarship had a big influence of making the native population citizens of the Swedish crown. Also the punishment had a big impact, which mainly affected the partisan group called snapphanar. This is in detail described by Wikipedia. 20 th century Danish popular historians` describe the abuses on the natives by the Swedish realm while the Swedish historians mostly describe snapphanars rubies on them...|$|E

Footnotes p. 179 - 188 Collective memories are usually sanctioned by ruling elites, who determine {{the types of}} memory that should be remembered along with how they should be remembered. With {{the emergence of the}} Internet, individuals have taken {{a more active role in}} preserving and re-presenting the past, thereby opening up a fertile terrain for the study of non-official collective memories. As an open-source <b>website,</b> <b>Wikipedia</b> has the potential to broaden the range of memories accessible on a global platform, memories that may or may not be sanctioned by elites. This thesis seeks to examine the ways national events are remembered on a global platform such as Wikipedia, and the implications of having that borderless public space for the representation and remembrance of events. Using textual analysis, this paper first examines the ways in which the New York Times and Xinhua News Agency reported on and interpreted the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989, and how the protests were subsequently remembered in both presses in the 21 st century. This paper then compares the official memory of the protests in the two presses with its public memory, as represented by the ways in which contributors on Wikipedia remember the protests. Findings point to Wikipedia as a site of struggle over the hierarchy of memories, serving as a mirror into the present social order and power in our global society. The interaction between alternative and opposing memories on Wikipedia both reveal and is affected by the differences in how the protests were framed and made meaningful only to those who belong to certain cultural groups. This then calls into question the possibility of having a wider range of memories that encompasses the un-reported and underreported memories of an iconic event in the digital age...|$|E
