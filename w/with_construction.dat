40|$|Abstract. The {{generalized}} Schrodinger equation deduced in {{the previous}} papers is compared <b>with</b> conventional <b>constructions</b> of quantum field theory. In particular, it yields the usual Schrodinger equation of quantum field theory written without normal ordering. In the papers [2, 3] a generalization of the Schrodinger equation to multidimensional variational problems has been deduced. In the present paper this equation is compared <b>with</b> <b>constructions</b> of quantum field theory. To make the paper more self-contained, first the derivation of the generalized Schrodinger equation from [3] is briefly recalled...|$|R
