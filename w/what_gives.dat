5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E

It uses the bitter Galena, Nugget and Target hop varieties which have undergone an isomerized kettle extract process. There are about a third more hops than in Guinness Draught and the beer has 47 Bitterness Units. The beer is force carbonated.|$|E

25|$|Crème fraîche is {{produced}} by adding a starter culture to heavy cream, and allowing it to stand at appropriate temperature until thick.

25|$|Switching {{regulators}} rapidly switch {{a series}} device on and off. The duty {{cycle of the}} switch sets how much charge is transferred to the load. This is controlled by a similar feedback mechanism as in a linear regulator. Because the series element is either fully conducting, or switched off, it dissipates almost no power; this is <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> the switching design its efficiency. Switching regulators are also able to generate output voltages which are higher than the input, or of opposite polarity — something not possible with a linear design.|$|E

This step can get the balls within ±. If the balls need more precision then they are lapped, again in {{the same type of}} machine. However, this time the rill plates are made of a softer material, usually cast iron, less pressure is applied, the plate is rotated slowly. This step is <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> bearing balls their shiny appearance and can bring the balls between grades 10 and 48.|$|E
25|$|Most rocket {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion heat engines (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas. This {{is achieved by}} combusting a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-shaped nozzle is <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times {{the speed of sound}} at sea level are common.|$|E

25|$|Young Earth creationists such as Ken Ham and Doug Phillips {{believe that}} God created the Earth {{within the last}} ten {{thousand}} years, literally {{as described in the}} Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the Ussher chronology). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. Creationist cosmologies give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer timelines.|$|E
25|$|There is an unsolved {{issue about}} his final rank. Sources like the {{promotion}} recommendations from Generals Hardee and Johnston speak for a promotion from Major to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1864. There are several authors who {{speak of a}} promotion either from Major to Colonel or from Lieutenant Colonel to Colonel - <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> those voices credibility {{is the most common}} date when the promotion was dated, February 20, 1864. His microfilmed muster roll also lists his highest rank as Colonel. In the Official Records on most occasions everyone (Lt. Col. or Col.) is simply addressed as Col., including Smith in the later war years. However, there is a single document in which Smith and other artillery officers are strictly differed into Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels. This document refers to Smith as (full) Colonel. It is authorized by Major General Arnold Elzey, commanding the artillery of the Army of Tennessee; and written by Captain Charles Swett, Elzey's Inspector General, on December 21, 1864.|$|E

25|$|Brut Rose Champagnes {{came along}} in the 1990s, a version as dry as regular Brut Champagne. They are {{produced}} either by leaving the clear juice of black grapes to macerate on its skins {{for a brief time}} (known as the saignée method) or, more commonly, by adding a small amount of still Pinot Noir red wine to the sparkling wine cuvée. Champagne is typically light in colour even if it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes the amount of time the juice spends in contact with the skins, which is <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> red wine its colour. Rosé Champagne {{is one of the few}} wines that allow the production of Rosé by the addition of a small amount of red wine during blending. This ensures a predictable and reproducible colour, allowing a constant Rosé colour from year-to-year. Popular in many countries and especially well-welcomed in Estonia where it was first introduced by an Estonian entrepreneur Henry-Jörgen Rautits, pink Champagne is very popular amongst high-end restaurants due to its soft yet sensitive taste, which is highly appreciated by wealthier customers.|$|E
25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones {{found in our}} first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. <b>What</b> <b>gives</b> some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.|$|E
