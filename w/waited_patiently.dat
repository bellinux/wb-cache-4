5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{men into}} {{battle for the}} first time ever, Scarlett ordered his brigade to form two columns. The left column {{contained}} a squadron of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, followed by the two squadrons of the Scots Greys. As they trotted to the assistance of the Campell's Highlanders, Scarlett was informed of additional Russian cavalry threatening his flank. Ordering the brigade to wheel about, the Scots Greys ended up in line with the Inniskilling Dragoons in the front row supported by the 5th Dragoon Guards. Even with the Russian cavalry approaching, Scarlett <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for his dragoons to be brought into formation rather than move in a disorganised formation.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} Confederate {{force on}} the road {{up the hill to}} the Pass consisted of a detachment of 20 dismounted cavalrymen under Capt. George M. Emack from the 1st Maryland Cavalry Battalion, along with a single cannon. As Union troopers from the 5th Michigan Cavalry approached Emack's men, the cannon opened fire and eight of the Marylanders conducted a mounted charge into the head of the Union column. In the dark and the heavy rain, the Union cavalrymen were taken by surprise and many of them retreated in panic. The Confederate cavalrymen dismounted and took up positions {{on both sides of the}} road. When the Federals returned, Emack's men <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> until they were about 10 yards away and opened fire. The Union cavalrymen were convinced they were opposed by a much larger force. While this standoff continued, Ewell's wagons were moving as swiftly as possible to get out of range of the Union cavalry threat.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstances}} of this attack and the assassin were known exceptionally {{well after the}} attempt, as pamphlets soon appeared on the Market Square reporting three different viewpoints on the subject, published {{in a total of}} five editions. The assassin was indeed Michał Piekarski, always regarded by the society as a freak, a melancholic, unrestrained in deeds (as a child he suffered head and brain damage – this may have been the cause of his mental illness). Earlier, he murdered the royal cook and killed or wounded several people from the royal court. Piekarski, after hearing the news of the successful assassination of Henry IV in Paris (1610), decided to assassinate Sigismund, simply for fame. For the appropriate moment he <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for 10 years. At trial he did not deny the crime he committed and heavily insulted the jury, the Court Marshal, and the monarch. He was executed {{in exactly the same way}} as François Ravaillac (the killer of the French king) on 26 November 1620 in Warsaw, in a torture area called Piekiełko (Devil's den or Devil's place).|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to explain exactly what eventually brought about the battle, assuming that neither side simply attacked without forethought. Clearly though, at some point just before the battle, new information began to reach Xerxes of rifts in the allied command; the Peloponnesians wished to evacuate from Salamis while they still could. This alleged rift amongst the Allies may have simply been a ruse, in order to lure the Persians to battle. [...] Alternatively, this change in attitude amongst the Allies (who had <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> {{off the coast of}} Salamis for at least a week while Athens was captured) may have been in response to Persian offensive maneuvers. Possibly, a Persian army had been sent to march against the Isthmus in order to test the nerve of the fleet.|$|E

500|$|Football hooliganism {{reached its}} height in the 1970s and 80s. West Ham's Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers firm {{were at the}} {{forefront}} of the trouble, not just against each other, but against the police and firms associated with other football teams. In 1972, the two clubs played each other in a testimonial match for Millwall defender Harry Cripps, who began his career at West Ham. The game was marred by intense fighting between the two club's hooligan firms, both inside and outside the ground. Four years later, a Millwall supporter, Ian Pratt, died at New Cross railway station after falling out of a train during a fight with some West Ham fans. After the incident West Ham hooligans constructed the chant, [...] "West Ham boys, we've got brains, we throw Millwall under trains." [...] Millwall fans <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for two years for revenge, until West Ham were relegated to the Second Division. Prior to their next meeting with the Hammers on 7 October 1978, leaflets were distributed at Millwall's home matches bearing the words: [...] "A West Ham fan must die to avenge him." [...] The police responded with an unprecedented show of force for the game at Upton Park, which West Ham won 3–0. Some 500 officers controlled the crowd, carrying out extensive searches and strict segregation.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the greater}} fame {{achieved}} by his other works, {{such as that}} on special relativity, it was {{his work on the}} photoelectric effect that won him his Nobel Prize in 1921: [...] "For services to theoretical physics and especially for the discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect." [...] The Nobel committee had <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for experimental confirmation of special relativity; however, none was forthcoming until the time dilation experiments of Ives and Stilwell (1938), (1941) and Rossi and Hall (1941).|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after {{reports of}} the slaying spread, {{blockades}} were set up several miles northeast and southwest on Highway 67 East. Sheriff Davis called in officers from the entire area {{to help in the}} investigation; some of which included two agents from the FBI, Captain Gonzaullas and other Rangers, Sheriff Presley and his deputies, Sheriff Jim Sanderson from Little River County, Arkansas State Police, local police, and many others. In the house, investigators found a trail of blood with scattered teeth. On the dining room table was Mrs. Starks' work for making a dress. Gonzaullas, after seeing the [...] "virtual river of blood", stated that [...] "It is beyond me why she did not bleed to death." [...] There were only two bullet holes in the window, leading Sheriff Davis to believe an automatic rifle was used. Investigators declared that after the killer shot Virgil, he <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> outside the window to shoot the wife.|$|E

2500|$|After a huge win in London against Anderson Silva, Michael Bisping {{finally got}} his long-awaited UFC title fight in a rematch against Luke Rockhold at UFC 199 at The Forum in Inglewood, California, who {{submitted}} Bisping at [...] on 7 November 2014 in Sydney, Australia with a guillotine choke in round 2. Rockhold was originally set to rematch Chris Weidman, who {{he took the}} title from at UFC 194, but, Weidman was forced to withdraw due to a neck injury. The UFC's first choice was Ronaldo Souza but 'Jacaré' was undergoing knee sergury. Therefore, the UFC chose Bisping to face Luke Rockhold for the UFC Middleweight Championship. Despite being 37 years old, with only 2 weeks notice and being a 10/1 underdog, all it took Bisping was a left hook to wobble the Californian with another left after he <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for Rockhold to get back up. Bisping landed 3 strikes after he dropped Rockhold again and referee John McCarthy stopped the fight. Michael Bisping fulfilled his destiny and realised his dream. Bisping was crowned UFC World Middleweight Champion {{and became the first}} British World Champion in UFC history.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{began by}} writing tracks for {{artists such as}} Alesha Dixon, Chipmunk, Professor Green, Devlin, Preeya Kalidas, Cheryl Cole, and Tinie Tempah. While {{trying to get into}} the music {{industry}} she was studying Medicine at the University of Glasgow, but she decided to stop in her fourth year. Sandé always said that her education was the most important thing to her, stating if her music career was to fail, she would have her education to fall back on. Sandé said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> since she was 16, saying [...] "Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. He also knows my parents are keen that I finish university." [...] Sandé first performed publicly when she provided guest vocals on Chipmunk's hit single, [...] "Diamond Rings" [...] which she also wrote in 2009. A year later she returned again to the public's attention when she teamed up with Wiley on his comeback single, [...] "Never Be Your Woman", the song became Sandé second top-ten single on the UK Singles Chart. It was later announced that [...] "Never Be Your Woman" [...] was a trail for Sandé with EMI Records to see how well the song charted, with the success the song had, Sandé later signed a record deal with Virgin Records.|$|E
