5|$|Cousse's message {{confirmed}} {{the fears of}} Faisal's cabinet that Gouraud <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> taking over Syria by force. The cabinet subsequently rejected Gouraud's ultimatum and issued a largely symbolic appeal {{to the international community}} to end the French advance. On 23 July, Al-'Azma set out from Damascus with his motley force of army regulars and volunteers, which was divided into northern, central and southern columns each headed by camel cavalry units. French forces launched their offensive towards Khan Maysalun and Wadi al-Qarn shortly after dawn on 24 July, at 5:00, while Syrian forces were waiting at their positions overlooking the low end of Wadi al-Qarn.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E

5|$|During the tour, Miller {{generally}} {{played in}} the Tests as an opening bowler alongside Lindwall and as a middle-order batsman, coming in at No. 4 or No. 5. His batting ability was such that he played as a specialist batsman {{even when he was}} unable to bowl due to injury, such as during the Second Test. Miller wanted to play purely as a batsman, feeling that the workload of bowling would hinder his run-scoring. However, Bradman <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> going through the tour undefeated, and utilised his bowling options to the full, to maximise the Australians’ chances of winning. Lindwall and Miller were the first-choice pace duo, {{regarded as one of the}} greatest speed pairings in the history of cricket, whereas the latter was just one of many accomplished batsmen in the team. As a result, the Australian skipper valued Miller more as an opening bowler. He ended the Tests with 184runs at 26.28 and 13wickets at 23.15 from 138.1overs and took eight catches.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Jefferson's presidency, the United States {{had paid}} tribute {{to a number of}} Arab states in the Mediterranean to prevent attacks on its shipping. By the time Jefferson assumed office, the United States Navy had been {{developed}} {{to the point where it}} might adequately defend American shipping interests. Jefferson consequently refused to pay tribute in 1801 to Yusuf Karamanli, the ruler of Tripoli, after which the Tripolitans began attacking and seizing American merchant vessels. In a cabinet discussion held in early 1801 to formulate a response, it was suggested that the President declare war on Tripoli. Lincoln pointed out that only Congress had the authority to declare war, but the rest of the cabinet <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> taking some sort of action. The matter was tabled until May 1801, when the cabinet voted to send a naval squadron to the area to defend the country's merchant interests. Jefferson never asked for or received from Congress a formal war declaration against the Barbary states.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1125 the Jin had conquered all Song territories {{north of}} the Huai River. In 1142, a peace treaty settled {{the border between the}} two states, putting the Jin in control of {{northern}} China and the Song in control of the south. Wanyan Liang was enthroned in 1150, and <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> uniting northern and southern China under a single emperor. In 1158, he asserted that the Song had violated the 1142 treaty, a pretext for declaring war on the Song. He began preparations for the war in the following year. He instituted a draft in which all able-bodied men were required to enlist. The draft was unpopular, precipitating revolts that were later suppressed. The Jin army left the capital of Kaifeng on October 15, 1161, and pushed through from the Huai to the Yangtze River without much resistance from the Song.|$|E

5|$|The end of World War II was {{followed}} by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing {{the size of the}} various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, but fears existed that the nation would slide back into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should take. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned {{to keep them}} out of the hands of the Mexican army. Santa Anna <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E
5|$|After Elliott Fitch Shepard's {{death in}} March 1893, Margaret donated the present church {{building}} and manse. The Spanish Renaissance-style church {{was designed by}} Augustus Haydel (a nephew of Stanford White) and August D. Shepard (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and of William Rutherford Mead). The two nephews later designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan. The church's cornerstone was laid on October 13, 1893. During construction of the building's foundation, workers found quicksand, though Shepard <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> constructing the church there and had the construction workers dig 30 feet into the ground to find firm ground for the foundation. European workers {{were brought to the}} site to aide in the building's construction. The Italian Renaissance Revival building was of limestone delivered from Indiana by railroad, requiring a special track laid at Scarborough to accommodate the delivery. The completed church was dedicated on May 11, 1895 in memory of Elliott Fitch Shepard. It was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church. The dedication was attended by Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Chauncey Depew, William Sloane of W. & J. Sloane, William Seward Webb, H. Walter Webb, and James A. Burden II.|$|E

5|$|On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno {{warned that}} the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or {{possibly}} even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did {{not rule out the}} possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue modernization and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and modernization, and <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} {{cinematic}} scenes {{was written by}} Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on {{at the same time}} as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure. As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided to make it an origin story for the weapon. An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for the entire series. These issues were further complicated by the third year of development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi <b>was</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam. The early part of the story was quite different from earlier Zelda titles, playing out in a similar way to a school drama. Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the cinematics. The total number of cinematics was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.|$|E
