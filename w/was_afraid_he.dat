500|$|Murphy {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity following his World War II military service when Life magazine proclaimed him America's [...] "most decorated soldier" [...] in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. That magazine cover {{brought him to the}} attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to Hollywood. When Murphy arrived in California after his military discharge, Cagney cancelled the hotel reservations he'd made for Murphy and instead took him into his own home, [...] "I got the shock of my life. Audie was very thin. His complexion was bluish-gray." [...] Commenting years later on his first impression, Cagney said, [...] " [...] in such a nervous condition that I <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>he</b> might jump out of a window. I took him home and gave him my bed." [...] He spent three weeks as a guest of Cagney and then returned to Texas before finally agreeing to an offer from brothers James and William Cagney of $150 a week as a contract player with their production company. The Cagneys gave Murphy personal attention on acting techniques. He also took lessons at the Actors' Lab on Sunset Boulevard. Murphy studied voice techniques, learned judo, and trained with choreographer John Boyle, Cagney's dance coach for Yankee Doodle Dandy. A 1947 disagreement with William Cagney ended his association with the brothers without having been cast in a film production.|$|E
500|$|Claims that Bury {{could have}} been the Ripper began to appear in {{newspapers}} shortly after Bury's arrest. Like Bury, the Ripper had inflicted abdominal wounds on his victims immediately after their deaths, and Bury lived in Bow, near Whitechapel, from October 1887 to January 1889, which placed him fairly near the Whitechapel murders at the appropriate time. The Dundee Advertiser of 12 February claimed that the Burys' [...] "neighbours were startled and alarmed at the idea that one whom in their terror they associated with the Whitechapel tragedies had been living in their midst." [...] The New York Times of the same day connected Bury directly to the atrocities and reported the theory that William had murdered Ellen to prevent her from revealing his guilt, a story picked up and repeated by The Dundee Courier the following day. The Courier alleged that Bury admitted to Lieutenant Parr that he was Jack the Ripper, but Parr's version of the story says only that Bury said he <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>he</b> would be arrested as Jack the Ripper. Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's murder. Nevertheless, the executioner James Berry promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper. Berry did not include Bury or the Ripper in his memoirs, My Experiences as an Executioner, but Ernest A. Parr, a journalist in the Suffolk town of Newmarket, wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland on 28 March 1908 that Berry [...] "told me explicitly that Bury was known to have been Jack the Ripper".|$|E
500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because of who he is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because I <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>he</b> would think I was going after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E

2500|$|Another common legend, again {{dating back}} to the 1960s, was that a man who took LSD went insane and {{permanently}} thought that he was a glass of orange juice.

When Ayesha tells him she <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>he</b> would be caught, he says: [...] "Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai" [...] ("It is not just hard to catch Don, it is impossible.") and the film ends with the song [...] "Dushman Mera".|$|E

2500|$|Garbo never married, had no children, {{and lived}} alone as an adult. Her most famous romance {{was with her}} {{frequent}} co-star, John Gilbert, with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927. Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her acting on the set, teaching her how to behave like a star, how to socialize at parties, and {{how to deal with}} studio bosses. They costarred again in three more hits, Love (1927), A Woman of Affairs (1928), and Queen Christina (1933). Gilbert allegedly proposed to her numerous times, with Garbo agreeing but backing out at the last minute. [...] "I was in love with him," [...] she said. [...] "But I froze.

2500|$|Next {{the defense}} called Thomas Shoatman to the stand.

Shoatman testified that Celia had said that she struck Newsom the first time [...] "only to hurt him, to keep him from having sexual intercourse with her" [...] (although the phrase [...] "to keep him from having sexual intercourse with her" [...] was stricken from the record after an objection from the prosecution), and that she had struck the second blow because [...] "he threw his hands up, that she <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>he</b> would catch her." [...] With Thomas Shoatman's testimony, the defense attempted to convince the jurors that Celia had been acting in self-defense when she had killed Newsom.|$|E
2500|$|He {{suspected}} his father, Michael, {{suffered from}} this [...] "sickness of the spirit" [...] {{because of something}} he had done {{as a young man}} or while grieving the loss of his first wife. Lee M. Hollander thought he <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>he</b> had committed the Eternal sin, one that can never be forgiven. Kierkegaard called his gaining knowledge of his father's sin the [...] "great earthquake". Maybe he heard someone say that cursing God was the unforgivable sin or that fornication was the unforgivable sin. [...] Kierkegaard wrote out of concern for his father's anxiety and others like him who believe that God shuts his door against them. He asks, “How does a person get to know that he is the greatest sinner?” Kierkegaard started in Either/Or with two characters known only as A and B, both were in search of a self, and he worked himself up to The Concept of Anxiety where he remarked; [...] "If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of “self,” it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness." [...] His father was only twelve when he cursed God and didn't have faith that God would forgive him. Goethe had the same problem because he had many experiences while he was still young.|$|E

2500|$|Remembered by {{his contemporaries}} as a tragic figure who held much {{literary}} promise, Thomas Parker Sanborn {{came to be}} linked {{with a group of}} other 1890s Harvard poets who died young, including Hugh McCulloch, Philip Henry Savage, Trumbull Stickney and George Cabot Lodge. Santayana published two obituaries for Sanborn, the first of which appeared in the Harvard Monthly Volume eight, Number One, March 1889. [...] "The rare facility and delicacy of Mr. Sanborn's verses," [...] Santayana wrote, [...] "and his general literary aptitude, marked him out among his class-mates. His witty conversation, and much more the inward seriousness and idealism of his nature endeared him to those that knew him well. He was too sensitive and retiring to like general society, or to speak out his thoughts: he was more at ease with his pen. Mr. Sanborn had not only great felicity of style in his light verses, but he could put into them what is far more rare in the work of very young men,-- a true love of whatever is charming, beautiful and ideal. Yet with this idealism was joined a genuine and pathetic modesty. He <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>he</b> was wrong, he longed for recognition and external encouragement. This premature death is a calamity not to Mr. Sanborn's family and intimate friends alone. The class of '86 and Harvard College lose a man whose life would have been devoted to letters, and whose genuine and versatile talent would hardly have failed to leave some mark in the world." ...|$|E
