5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β {{rings are}} the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, {{the same event}} revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The masses of the α and β rings {{are estimated to be}} about 5kg (each)—half the mass of the ε ring.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> may have many periods of heat {{over the course}} of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids {{are easy to}} culture {{on a large scale}} in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} shared traits {{with the}} dodo, its closest relative, such as size and {{features in the}} skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> changed considerably with maturity.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.|$|E
50|$|By definition, {{stem cells}} possess two properties: (1) <b>they</b> can self-renew, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> that <b>they</b> can divide indefinitely while {{remaining}} in an undifferentiated state; and (2) they are pluripotent or multipotent, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> that <b>they</b> can differentiate to form specialized cell types. Due to the self-renewal capacity of stem cells, a stem cell {{line can be}} cultured in vitro indefinitely.|$|R

This indicates there's a precedent for The Icemark making a treaty with the vampires.|$|R
5|$|Pool of Radiance {{is based}} on the same game {{mechanics}} as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set. As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in Pool of Radiance has a character race and a character class, determined {{at the beginning of the}} game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character's alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character's combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring character continuation regardless of events in the game. On an MS-DOS computer, the game can be copied to the hard-disk drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate save-game disk.|$|E
5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E
25|$|After a {{while they}} decided to change the band’s name {{and came up with}} Þeyr, which was drawn from a poem by Skuggi and it means Wind or Thaw in old Icelandic. Interestingly, Þeyr is exactly {{pronounced}} as þeir, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> (male gender).|$|E

25|$|Kant {{believed}} that mathematical truths were forms of synthetic a priori knowledge, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> are necessary and universal, yet known through intuition. Kant's often brief remarks about mathematics influenced the mathematical school known as intuitionism, {{a movement in}} philosophy of mathematics opposed to Hilbert's formalism, and the logicism of Frege and Bertrand Russell.|$|E
25|$|The main {{commercial}} {{species in the}} high seas are the highly migratory species. These fish make long migrations across the high seas and are fished by many nations. Highly migratory fish also cross boundaries without regard for international laws. In particular, they enter the EEZ zones of the U.S., <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> become important species also for U.S. coastal fisheries.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} task in stochastic geometry network models is choosing {{a mathematical model}} for {{the location of the}} network nodes. The standard assumption is that the nodes are represented by (idealized) points in some space (often Euclidean Rn, and even more often in the plane R2), <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> form a stochastic or random structure known as a (spatial) point process.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} {{have a lower}} density than water, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> are {{lighter and}} will form a separate layer on top of water. An important exception: most of the halogenated solvents like dichloromethane or chloroform will sink {{to the bottom of}} a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is important to remember when partitioning compounds between solvents and water in a separatory funnel during chemical syntheses.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to foraging, males and juveniles are more active than females. Females are only equally or more active than males during the {{reproductive}} season. Males may be more active due to seeking mates and defending territories. Bradypodion pumilum is a sit-and-wait forager <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> will rarely move and wait for prey to cross their paths, only then striking out. Low rates of prey capture are often seen in this species.|$|E

Also, the vector spaces are usually required to be over the real or complex numbers, {{in which case the}} vector bundle {{is said to be a}} real or complex vector bundle (respectively). Complex vector bundles can be viewed as real vector bundles with additional structure. In the following, we focus on real vector bundles in the category of topological spaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{females are}} small and nest in the high arctic, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> are more likely under a higher cold stress than birds nesting in {{temperate}} areas. Consequently, the females {{spend an average of}} 82.5% of their time incubating their eggs. In total, the females incubate the eggs for about 22 days. She generally lays 4 olive to green eggs; laying 3 eggs is rare. The eggs can sometimes be blotched with brown, olive-brown or grey spots.|$|E
25|$|The second violins play {{exactly the}} same but an octave lower and at half the speed, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> play 6 beats (one bar) of silence to begin, and appear to enter at the {{beginning}} of the second bar. Then the violas, which are the only voice not doubled, join in at quarter speed and another octave lower, the cellos at one eighth, and finally the contrabasses as one sixteenth.
