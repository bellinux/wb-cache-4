40|$|Bite marks {{inflicted on}} animate and inanimate objects will undergo {{a certain degree}} of deformation. This fact remains one of the biggest {{stumbling}} blocks when analysing evidence for court presentation. It has been demonstrated that the reliability of pattern association analysis will not be affected by minimal degrees of <b>warping,</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and distortion. In this study affine transformations were applied to bite marks to establish if minimal distortions would affect the mathematically determined relationships of the defined features. In a real case study, it was then tested whether the distorted bite marks match the dentition of the perpetrator by applying an affine transformation. This was confirmed to be the case. Affine transformations will thus not affect the relationships of the individual features found in bite marks. The numerical calculations validate the reliability of pattern association analysis in the presence of minimal amounts of <b>warping,</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and distortion...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of forensic odontology regularly requires the forensic dental expert {{to establish a}} degree of concordance between two objects, {{one or both of}} which have undergone minimal degrees of <b>warping,</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and distortion collectively described as deformations. These comparisons can be between the suspect’s or victim’s dentition and bite marks on inanimate objects/skin, two radiological images, palatal rugae patterns, dental arches, lip prints and other unique scenarios which are presented in forensic odontological cases. This paper will define the mathematical concept of affine transformation as it pertains to forensic matters and explains how it can be applied to a case study involving pattern deformations. Although the deformation of the evidence may be minimal in extent, it creates a measure of uncertainty when expert evidence is given in court cases. Any metric discrepancy caused by deformation of the evidence will necessitate the application of pattern association and negate the use of metric analysis. It has been shown that a pattern association analysis of evidence will not be affected by minimal amounts of deformation. The mathematical limits of these deformations which will significantly affect the comparisons have not yet been determined. In the case study presented the deformations were considered minimal and thus explainable by a pattern association analysis. The mathematical concepts will empower the expert to explain to a court of law how two samples which were not a perfect match, could in fact be deformed equivalents of common origin...|$|R
50|$|Excessive setup {{specific}} {{material cost}} {{and lack of}} support for 3rd party resins is a major challenge with SLA process:. The choice of material (a design process) is restricted by the supported resin. Hence, the mechanical properties are also fixed. When scaling up dimensions selectively to deal with expected stresses, post curing is done by further treatment with UV light and heat. Although advantageous to mechanical properties, the additional polymerization and cross linkage can result in <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>warping</b> and residual thermal stresses. Hence, the part shall be designed in its 'green' stage i.e. pre-treatment stage.|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} {{stockpile}} stewardship {{and other important}} nondestructive test (NDT) applications, the authors seek improved methods for rapid evaluation of materials to detect degradation, <b>warping,</b> and <b>shrinkage.</b> Typically, such tests involve manual measurements of dimensions on radiographs. The authors seek to speed the process and reduce the costs of performing NDT by analyzing radiographic data using a least-squares fitting technique for rapid evaluation of industrial parts. In 1985, Whitman, Hanson, and Mueller demonstrated a least-squares fitting technique that very accurately locates the edges of cylindrically symmetrical objects in radiographs. To test the feasibility of applying this technique to {{a large number of}} parts, the authors examine whether an automated least squares algorithm can be routinely used for measuring the dimensions and attenuations of materials in two nested cylinders. The proposed technique involves making digital radiographs of the cylinders and analyzing the images. In the authors` preliminary study, however, they use computer simulations of radiographs...|$|R

In {{order to}} analyze the {{influence}} of dimensional stability on overfeed sewing shrinkage of wool fabric, the paper used theoretical analysis equation to evaluate and overfeed sewing shrinkage of wool-type fabrics and took water shrinkage as index of dimensional stability to analyze its influence on overfeed sewing shrinkage characteristic value such as connection length, fabric connection length ratio. The research revealed the relationship of dimensional stability and overfeed sewing shrinkage, and derived calculation method of oblique shrinkage based on analysis of <b>warp</b> and weft <b>shrinkage.</b> It provided the theory reference on sewing quality of wool fabric in apparel manufacture and use...|$|R
5000|$|Wood warping is a {{deviation}} from flatness in timber {{as a result}} of stresses and uneven <b>shrinkage.</b> <b>Warping</b> can also occur in wood considered [...] "dry" [...] (wood can take up and release moisture indefinitely), when it takes up moisture unevenly, or - especially - is allowed to return to its [...] "dry" [...] equilibrium state unevenly, too slowly, or too quickly. Many factors can contribute to wood warp; wood species, grain orientation, air flow, sunlight, uneven finishing, temperature - even cutting season and the moon's gravitational pull are taken into account in some traditions (e.g., violin making).|$|R
40|$|A {{step-by-step}} {{method of}} analysis is used in this paper to study {{the long-term effects of}} shrinkage in prestressed concrete members, and in particular <b>shrinkage</b> <b>warping</b> and loss of prestress. The step-by-step method is also being used in a parallel study of creep in prestressed concrete beams. A simple, closed-form equation is derived for the long-term shrinkage curvature in the cross-section of a rectangular prestressed member that contains tensile and compressive reinforcing steel. This allows the shrinkage deflection of the member to be calculated by first evaluating curvatures at key sections and then integrating. A simple, closed-form equation is also derived for the long-term loss of prestress due to shrinkage. Numerical studies show that tensile and compressive reinforcement strongly influence both the curvature and the prestress loss due to shrinkage. An assumption made in the analyses is that shrinkage occurs uniformly throughout the concrete. This is the basis of the current AS 3600 shrinkage clauses, and hence also of most current shrinkage design calculations. In reality, shrinkage in concrete members is non-uniform and non-linear. The paper concludes with a discussion of non-uniform shrinkage, and gives an outline of how the step-by-step method can be used to analyse non-uniform shrinkage. RF Warne...|$|R
40|$|Three Dimensional Printing, a rapid {{prototyping}} technology, fabricates ceramic casting shells directly from 3 -D CAD models. To create a shell, loose alumina powder in thin layers {{is joined by}} selectively depositing a colloidal silica binder. Firing fuses the silica to the alumina, and subsequent processing removes the unbound powder from the casting cavity. In some instances, it may be advantageous to perform powder removal before firing. This requires higher green strength than what is obtainable with the current binder. An alternative binder consisting of 18 vol. % colloidal silica co-dispersed with 10 vol. % acrylic emulsion in an aqueous medium was developed. The polymeric component imparts higher green strength to the part (3. 6 vs. 0. 4 MPa), yet decomposes during firing to minimize interference with the fusion of silica to alumina. The reduction of fired strength in samples printed with co-dispersions was less than 10 %. Through designed experiments, performance of the co-dispersion was quantified by additional criteria such as <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>warping,</b> and binder stability. Average linear shrinkage in parts printed with co-dispersions was 0. 05 % after firing at 900 °C. A simple model for warping, based on elastic response of a plate to free thermal strain, predicts that flat plates tend to warp into a paraboloid after firing. The experimental results correlated well with this prediction. by Richard Li-Chao Yu. Thesis (M. S.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 1994.

40|$|Keywords: polyolefin, polypropylene, polyethylene, fused {{deposition}} modeling, 3 D printing, <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>warping</b> With the continuous developments, FDM has surpassed the status as rapid prototyping method, and matured {{to the point}} where it is widely applied in direct manufacturing of various end-use products. However, the end-use applications are partly limited due to most current feedstock materials being prone to degradation in high-temperature, humid and chemically aggressive environments. The goal of this thesis was to evaluate the per-formance of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) as alternative feedstock materi-als in the FDM process. PP and PE are prevalent polyolefin plastics and their principal value lies in the attractive balance of physical properties in the solid state and chemical inertness, and for the same reasons, they represent attractive FDM feedstock materials for the environmentally challenging conditions. However, as highly semi-crystalline plastics they show substantial solidification shrinkage upon cooling, and the shrinkage induced contractile stresses can deform the deposited parts. In this work, the performance of PP and PE as feedstock materials in FDM was evaluat-ed through several deposition experiments. The entire manufacturing chain from fila-ment fabrication to deposition of specimens was controlled. Bonding quality between deposited filament strands at varying deposition conditions was assessed by preparing and testing tensile specimens, and comparing the results to injection molded counter-parts. The effects of deposition conditions on the <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>warp</b> deformation were studied by depositing specimens with different geometrical features. Based on the results, FDM of PP and PE feedstock materials is feasible and holds a great potential, but requires special arrangements and awareness of the inherent chal-lenges. Bonding quality was highest at high temperature deposition conditions, and only roughly 10 % loss in yield strength was observed when compared to injection molded counterparts. All specimens, regardless of deposition conditions, showed poor ductility and little to no correlation was found between the elongation and deposition tempera-tures. Excessive heat flow to the specimen during deposition caused substantial shrink-age due to prolonged cooling of the deposited plastic, and consequently the most di-mensionally stable specimens were produced by limiting the deposition temperatures or increasing interlayer cooling time. Specimens with sharp protruding features showed higher tendency to peel off from the build platform than circular specimens did, due to differences in contractile stress distributions. Warp deformation became also more prom-inent when feature thickness was reduced. Nevertheless, the deposition performance under optimal conditions was for the most parts on par with many traditional feedstock materials...|$|R
50|$|An {{increasingly}} popular trend is to freeze dry the animal. For {{all intents and}} purposes, a freeze-dried mount is a mummified animal that still has fur on it. The internal organs are removed during preparation; however, all other tissue remains in the body. (The skeleton and all accompanying musculature is still {{beneath the surface of}} the fur.) The animal is positioned into the desired pose, then placed into the chamber of a special freeze drying machine designed specifically for this application. The machine freezes the animal and also creates a vacuum in the chamber. Pressure in the chamber helps vaporize moisture in the animal's body, allowing it to dry out. The rate of drying depends on vapor pressure. (The higher the pressure, the faster the specimen dries.) Vapor pressure is determined by temperature of the chamber; the higher the temperature, the higher the vapor pressure is at a given vacuum. The length of the dry-time is important because rapid freezing creates less tissue distortion (i.e.; <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>warping,</b> and wrinkling) The process can be done with reptiles, birds, and small mammals such as cats, rodents, and some dogs. Large specimens may require up to six months in the freeze dryer before they are completely dry. Freeze drying is the most popular type of pet preservation. This is because it is the least invasive in terms of what is done to the animal's body after death, which is a concern of owners (Most owners do not opt for a traditional skin mount).In the case of large pets, such as dogs and cats, freeze dying is also the best way to capture the animal's expression as it looked in life (another important concern of owners). Freeze drying equipment is costly and requires much upkeep. The process is also time-consuming; therefore, freeze drying is generally an expensive method to preserve an animal. The drawback to this method is that freeze-dried mounts are extremely susceptible to insect damage. This is because they contain large areas of dried tissue (meat and fat) for insects to feed upon. Traditional mounts are far less susceptible because they contain virtually no residual tissues (or none at all). Regardless of how well a taxidermy mount is prepared, all taxidermy is susceptible to insect damage. Taxidermy mounts are targeted by the same beetles and fabric moths that destroy wool sweaters and fur coats and that infest grains and flour in pantries.|$|R
