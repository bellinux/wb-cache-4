40|$|In recent years, living <b>wage</b> <b>movements</b> have {{developed}} around the United States. In addition to advocating for living wage ordinances and laws in cities, living <b>wage</b> <b>movements</b> {{have developed}} {{to advocate for}} living wage policies at universities across the country. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine living <b>wage</b> <b>movements</b> at two universities to understand how they use communication to frame the wage issue and to push {{for the implementation of}} living wage policies. To develop an understanding of these living <b>wage</b> <b>movements,</b> two cases, Texas A&M University and Georgetown University, were selected for this study to examine through the lens of the social movement framing perspective. Data for the cases included interviews with activists and administrators, media reports, video documentaries, and internal documents. Results showed that the living wage campaign in each case prioritized the components of collective action frames, diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational framing, differently. The Texas A&M living wage campaign focused heavily on developing the problem at an emotional level and offering a clear solution to the problem. The Georgetown living wage campaign focused heavily on laying blame for the problem. Each case also exhibited elements of master framing which linked its campaign to preexisting values. Most notably, in both cases, the existing university values and culture were used as a basis for master framing. The results also showed that the campaign targeted different constituencies, with the Texas A&M campaign attempting to gain popular support and the Georgetown campaign focusing on the university?s administration. This, along with the degree to which each campaign was willing to accept compromise, had a large impact on the campaigns? overall strategies. Overall, {{the results of this study}} show how communication related to an issue affects the course of a social movement and how a social movement approach can be used to create organizational change...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 The $ 15 <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> {{has grown}} {{substantially}} {{since the first}} $ 15 minimum wage initiative was passed in SeaTac, Washington in 2013. This dissertation investigates the geographies of the $ 15 <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> that has developed in the years since. Taking {{the form of a}} three-part comparative case study, this dissertation traces the connections and disconnections between $ 15 minimum wage campaigns in Seattle, Washington, Chicago, Illinois, and two cities in North Carolina, Greensboro and Durham. Drawing on one year of fieldwork and 101 interviews with policymakers, labor union staff, and activists, it argues that the $ 15 <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> {{is an example of a}} broader shift in labor organizing that has taken root in the last decade, which takes labor organizing out of its traditional location within workplaces and into broader social, political, and economic geographies. This geographic shift in the location, scale, and organization of labor politics is a long-awaited response to the spatial reorganization of work that occurred gradually beginning in the 1970 s, which has changed the potential spatiality of workplace solidarity. This study analyzes the discursive contestations of the $ 15 <b>wage</b> <b>movement,</b> both nationally and within local campaigns, as the campaign seeks to contest dominant understandings of how the low-wage labor market functions. It investigates the spatial organization of the Fight for $ 15, SEIU’s signature organizing campaign, noting how national-level coordination is carried out (or not carried out) on the local level and arguing that mobility between local campaigns is a central spatial strategy. Lastly, it investigates the politics surrounding the $ 15 minimum wage policy itself, using a historical view of minimum wage policy to argue that cycles of mobilization are tied to electoral politics and to the politics of rendering policies technical, ostensibly apolitical, and therefore mobile...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] There is {{no single}} or simple {{solution}} to the poverty and income inequality quagmire. Effecting policy change {{at the national level}} would require the type of macroeconomic strategies that are likely to engender fierce opposition and stonewalling tactics. And yet, criticism of the economic status quo, in which capital begets more capital and wage earners struggle to become, or remain, middle class, is growing louder. Some politicians are beginning to take notice and socio-economic policies may yet be devised to mitigate the worst of the excesses. In the meantime, progressive activists see more opportunity to make a difference at the local level, where the living <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> is indeed making strides. Linking the cause with other hot-button issues that play out locally, including the renewal of American cities large and small, economic development and new jobs, privatization of government services, and grassroots empowerment, enables proponents to rally support for the living wage agenda. Whether the living <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> eventually becomes a national force that seriously dents our poverty statistics remains an open question...|$|E

40|$|The modern living <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> {{was born}} in Baltimore in 1994, when the city passed an {{ordinance}} requiring firms to pay employees a rate above the minimum wage while working on city contracts. Since then, over 120 communities have followed suit, some setting wage floors {{more than twice the}} federal minimum wage, and some requiring various benefits. The astounding growth of the living <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> has been a response to the predicament of Americans who work but are unable to make ends meet, {{as well as to the}} public policies contributing to the problem. Public policies have exacerbated the problem from the federal level to the local level. Since the early 1980 s, the federal government has generally neglected the minimum wage; by 2005, a minimum wage paycheck bought less than it had in 49 of the last 50 years. Local governments have contributed to the problem, following the trend of cutting costs by contracting out services to firms who frequently pay lower wages and offer fewer benefits than public employment. Too often, economic development efforts have channeled public funds in the form of tax breaks or tax incentives to businesses without regard to the quality of the jobs those businesses provide. As a result of these policies, the two most common themes echoed by living wage proponents ar...|$|E

40|$|The living <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> {{was born}} out of {{frustration}} with Congress ’ failure to enact a minimum wage that lifts families out of poverty. 1 Initially, living wage activists focused their efforts on passing ordinances at the local level to ensure that the workers employed with government funds were paid above a poverty-level wage. After claiming victories in over 50 localities around the country, the living <b>wage</b> <b>movement</b> is now turning its attention to a group of workers laboring behind the scenes of federal government: those people who work on federal contracts yet earn only poverty-level wages. Recent legislation introduced in Congress would require businesses to pay workers employed on federal contracts a living wage, that is, the amount a full-time worker would need to earn to support a family of four at the poverty line (i. e., $ 17, 050 a year or $ 8. 20 an hour in 2000). This examination of federal living wage legislation finds that: According to data from fiscal year 1999, an estimated 162, 000 federal contract workers earn less than $ 8. 20 an hour 2 and thus would potentially be covered by proposed living wage legislation. These workers represent 11 % of the total 1. 4 million federal contract workers in the United States. An additional 59, 000 workers earning as much as a dollar an hour more than the poverty-level wage could also benefit from the spillover effect of living wage legislation.
