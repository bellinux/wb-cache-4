500|$|In August 2007, Microsoft {{issued its}} Game Content Usage Rules, a license {{intended}} {{to address the}} legal status of machinima based on its games, including the Halo series. Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you that you have to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E

2500|$|Randy Gradishar was called, [...] "the {{heart and}} soul of the {{original}} Orange Crush defense. He was the centerpiece of Joe Collier's 3-4 and the glue that held a ragtag bunch of degenerates and hand-me-downs (I mean that in a good way) together." [...] Pro Football Weekly 's personnel scout Joel Buchsbaum wrote that [...] "there are quite a few scouts <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you that former Broncos ILB Randy Gradishar was almost as good, even as good, as Jack Lambert" [...] and [...] "unlike Lambert, Gradishar was not a flashy headhunter, just a great anticipator who was a deadly tackler and great short-yardage defender".|$|E
2500|$|Ausmus' {{mother is}} Jewish, {{but he was}} not raised in the Jewish religion. Nonetheless, he still takes pride in his heritage. Ausmus stated in an {{interview}} with the Jewish Journal: [...] "I wasn't raised with the Jewish religion, so in that sense I don't really have much feeling toward it. But, however, in the last 10 or so years, I have had quite a few young Jewish boys <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> me that I am their favorite player or they love watching me play or they feel like baseball is a good fit for them because it worked for me or it worked for Shawn Green or other Jewish players at the major league level.

2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then I think that this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E

5000|$|In January 1982, with {{a concert}} in Čačak, Riblja Čorba started their Yugoslav tour. The tour's slogan was [...] "Ko preživi - pričaće" [...] ("Those <b>Who</b> Survive <b>Will</b> <b>Tell</b> the Tale"), which {{would prove to be}} a very unfortunate title. For the band's concert in Zagreb Ice Hall, held on February 8, an initial number of 10,500 tickets was sold out, and the {{organizers}} decided to put an additional number of 4,500 tickets to sale, thus making the hall overcrowded. As only two exit doors were open, in the rush {{at the end of the}} concert a fourteen-year-old girl Željka Marković was trampled, dying of injuries. Part of the press publicly attacked Bora Đorđević, Riblja Čorba and rock music in general. On the rest of the tour, the organizers reduced the number of tickets, and some of the concerts were cancelled, as the organizers feared of new problems.|$|R
5000|$|Several reviews {{criticized the}} game's [...] "invisible walls", which limited the player's freedom, the {{inability}} to progress without waiting for events scheduled to occur at specific times, excess cutscenes, and English voice acting. GameSpot wrote that by [...] "the time you're driving forklifts and participating in the game's QTE-filled conclusion, hours upon hours of boredom will have taken their toll." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that the story [...] "lags" [...] on the third disc. Game Informer criticized the game's lack of action, writing: [...] "Determining your character's next move requires little more than talking to someone, <b>who</b> <b>will</b> then <b>tell</b> you <b>who</b> to see or where to go ... all that's left is a guy walking around an amazingly detailed environment. If I wanted to experience that, I {{could see it in}} another game with proven endless entertainment value. It's called life." ...|$|R
