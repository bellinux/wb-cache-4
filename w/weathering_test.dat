40|$|Laboratory {{weathering}} {{tests are}} important {{in the field of}} restoration as they provide a means of estimating, in a relatively short time, the longer-term performance of conservation materials when applied in practice. Accelerated tests to simulate the damage caused to porous materials by soluble salts such as sodium sulphate are well known and highly effective. However, when using sodium chloride the existing test methods are not particularly successful. Research on case studies has shown that the environmental conditions {{play an important role in}} determining the occurrence of the decay. Therefore understanding the effect of the environmental conditions on the damage constitutes a first step in the development of an effective <b>weathering</b> <b>test</b> for sodium chloride. The research described in this paper studies the effect of environmental conditions on the decay due to sodium chloride with the ultimate aim of defining an effective laboratory test. The experiments have been performed on two plasters with very dffierent physical, mechanical and mineralogical properties. Different techniques of analysis have been used: mercury intrusion porosimetry, optical polarized microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy, chemical analyses and X-ray diffraction. The results obtained highlighted which of the test conditions under evaluation were the most effective. Using this information, a new procedure for an effective accelerated salt <b>weathering</b> <b>test</b> using sodium chloride is proposed...|$|E

Enhancement of the protection of oak wood against weathering using transparent hydrophobic coatings is presented in this study. Oak wood surfaces were modified using UV-stabilizers, hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS), and ZnO and TiO 2 nanoparticles before {{the application of a}} commercial hydrophobic topcoat. A transparent oil-based coating was used as a control coating system. The artificial <b>weathering</b> <b>test</b> lasted 6 weeks and colour, gloss, and contact angle changes were regularly evaluated during this period. The changes in the microscopic structure were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results proved limited durability against weathering of both tested hydrophobic coatings. The formation of micro-cracks causing the leaching of degraded wood compounds and discolouration of oak wood were observed after 1 or 3 weeks of the <b>weathering</b> <b>test.</b> Until then, an oil-based coating film had protected the wood sufficiently, but after 6 weeks the wood was fully defoliated to its non-homogenous thickness, which was caused by the presence of large oak vessels, and by the effects of specific oak tannins. Using transparent hydrophobic coatings can prolong the service life of the exteriors of wood products by decreasing their moisture content. Without proper construction protection against rainwater, the hydrophobic coating itself cannot guarantee the preservation of the natural appearance of wood exteriors...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} that coasts around the world present, is the regression and erosion of beaches. However, the factors involved in these processes are unclear. In this study, the influence of sediment erosion on beach regression has been analysed. In order to do that, a three-step investigation has been carried out. Firstly, coastline variations of four Spanish beaches have been analysed. Secondly, a study on sediment position along the beach profile has been developed. Finally, the process that beach sediments undergo along the surf zone when they are hit by the incident waves has been simulated by an accelerated particle <b>weathering</b> <b>test.</b> Samples of sand and shells were subjected to this accelerated particle <b>weathering</b> <b>test.</b> Results were supplemented with those from carbonate content test, XRD, SEM and granulometric analysis. Results shows a cross-shore classification of sediments along the beach profile in which finer particles move beyond offshore limit. Besides, {{it was observed that}} sediment erosion process is divided into three sages: i) particles wear due to crashes ii) dissolution of the carbonate fraction, and iii) breakage and separation of mineral and carbonate parts of particles. All these processes lead to a reduction of particle size. The mechanism responsible of beach erosion would consist of multiples and continuous particle location exchanges along the beach profile as a consequence of grain-size decrease due to erosion. M.
