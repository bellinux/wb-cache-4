25|$|A creative, piercing, probing, incisive, thought-provoking, inspiring, charismatic, careful, {{considerate}} and deliberative mind. The mind {{to stand}} up when others sit down. The mind to act when others refuse to act. The mind to stand even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> alone, battered, bruised and scorned, but still standing. Standing on principle, standing tall and standing for the people.|$|E
2500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{spoke of}} forgiveness, [...] "Blessed are the merciful, for {{they will be}} shown mercy." [...] (NIV) [...] "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift {{there in front of}} the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift." [...] (NIV) [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." [...] Mark 11:25 (NIV)* [...] "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.

[...] Luke 6:36 (NIV) [...] "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven." [...] Luke 6:37 (NIV) ...|$|E

5000|$|The Sage Francis song [...] "Hey Bobby" [...] {{references}} [...] "Masters of War" [...] {{with the}} lyrics [...] "Hey Bobby, the masters are back, and they're {{up to no}} good just like the old days. They played dead <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> over their graves, Bobby, they played dead <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> over their graves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please wait. What could I think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> told me? I {{was at the}} {{settlement}} that morning, and saw your cut lips <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> on the verandah." ...|$|R
5000|$|McCarthy: [...] "Is it true, Mr. Fields, that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> on {{the corner}} of Hollywood and Vine, 43 cars waited for your nose to change to green?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me go {{now from}} your presence, [...] And I will come again, [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> {{with your son}} beside you, [...] And be your servant then." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ho! don't you aim at a Afghan [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> on the sky-line clear; [...] An' don't {{you go for}} a Burman [...] If none o' {{your friends}} is near.|$|E
6000|$|... "St. Paul? Why, don't {{you like}} it? I don't {{know of any}} lovelier view than <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> on Summit Avenue and look across Lower Town to the Mississippi cliffs and the upland farms beyond." ...|$|E
60|$|But let us {{step inside}} {{of this great}} edifice. I think you will be there even more {{impressed}} with its height and extent than <b>you</b> were <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> on the outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a foolish}} man!" [...] said Euphemia, when I {{told her the}} above incident, [...] "to talk that way <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> there {{with a gun in}} your hand. You might have raked his wagon, fore and aft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, maybe I'd better hedge on the bet," [...] he said, {{laughing}} again. [...] "You {{have more}} in you than I suspect. You sure fooled me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> for the sheep-dip. But, come on, I'll take you anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's smart," [...] Carnally agreed. [...] "A hard man to beat, and {{you want}} to use a {{full-sized}} club <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> up to him; but I guess he'd go down if he got the right knock-out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fool!" [...] said another, [...] "is it {{not such}} talk which {{has brought us}} to our ruin? What is the brave man untrained to the brave man trained? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> before the sweep and rush of a Roman legion you may learn the difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|This little speech {{seemed to}} please his auditors, but his real reward came when Helen {{met him at}} the wings and caught his arm to her side in an ecstatic little hug. [...] "You did beautifully! You make me afraid of you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> tall and grand like that. You were scared though. I could see that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' {{said the}} Mouse,' 'now I {{know what has}} happened! It has all come out! You are a true friend to me! You have eaten it all <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> godmother; first the top off, then half of it gone, then----' ...|$|R
6000|$|Ray: [...] "Oh, {{leave my}} feet alone!... Everybody {{knew you were}} dead right in {{standing}} up for Prof Frazer. You remember how I roasted all the fellows in Omega Chi <b>when</b> they said <b>you</b> were nutty to boost him? And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> up in Chapel----Lord! that was nervy." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{novel is}} written in a first-person narrative, and Ellory uses {{descriptive}} prose extensively. For example, [...] "Blame is a bitter and indigestible thing, even when the blame is a coat you cut for yourself, even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> right there and got yourself measured so you could wear it right.".|$|R
6000|$|... may {{surely be}} remembered by you with regretful piety, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> by the blank stones which at once {{restrain}} and disgrace your native river, {{as the final}} worship rendered to it by modern philosophy. But a little incident which I saw last summer on its bridge at Wallingford, may put the contrast of ancient and modern feeling before you still more forcibly.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘General Chaffee dashed {{about with}} his hat {{on the back}} of his head like a {{magnificent}} cowboy, urging his men on, crying to them to get in and help their country win a victory. Smokeless powder makes it impossible to locate the enemy, and you wonder where the fire comes from. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> up to see you get a bullet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't lie to me!" [...] she shouted. [...] "You can lie in {{the dock}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> there and tell them you never murdered Douglas Romilly! That makes you cringe, doesn't it? I don't {{want to make a}} scene, but the woman you're in love with had better hear what I have to say. Are you going to give me back my money, Philip?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} for this interview, Don Luis," [...] Mercedes commenced, {{as soon as she}} had given herself time to command her {{feelings}}, [...] "in order that there may no longer be any reasons for mistaking our feelings and wishes. You have been suspected of having married the Lady Ozema; and there was a moment <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> on the verge of destruction, through the displeasure of Doña Isabella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it won't do, Sir Henry--it won't do! Even your voice, {{though you}} sunk {{it a few}} notes, was {{familiar}} enough to me. But hang it, man! What {{did you do it}} for? That's what gets over me. That you should stick up me, one of your closest friends, a man that worked himself to the bone <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> for the division--and all {{for the sake of a}} Brummagem watch and a few shillings--is simply incredible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jake, with a {{critical}} glance, [...] "they're all wrong. Now you've got good shoulders, your figure's well balanced, and I {{like the way}} you hold your head, but your tailor has spoiled every prominent line. I'll show <b>you</b> some time <b>when</b> I model <b>you</b> in clay." [...] He paused and grinned. [...] "I guess the Roman sentinel pose would suit you best, as I noted it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> on the mole waiting for me, determined to do your duty at any cost. Besides, there is something of the soldier about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is like an}} encampment {{of forest}} sons of Anak. The trees are huge and old. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> at their roots, the summits seem in another region. The trunks remain still and firm as pillars, while the boughs sway to every breeze. In the deepest calm their leaves are never quite hushed, and in high wind a flood rushes, a sea thunders above you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My good friend,' {{returned}} the knight, gently checking his impatience with his hand, 'of course I do. I see everything you speak of, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> aside, {{and do not}} interpose yourself between the view and me. I am very sorry for you. If I had not had the {{pleasure to meet you}} here, I think I should have written to tell you so. But you don't bear it as well as I had expected--excuse me--no, you don't indeed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum! He's about due. Do {{you feel}} a creeping, {{shrinking}} sensation, Watson, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> before the serpents in the Zoo, and see the slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and wicked, flattened faces? Well, that's how Milverton impresses me. I've {{had to do with}} fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can't get out of doing business with him--indeed, he is here at my invitation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have lived}} {{a sort of}} hermit's life, my dear Bob, {{since the death of}} your blessed parents," [...] said the divine, {{clearing}} his eyes of tears; [...] "now and then cheered by a precious letter from yourself and Maud--I call you both by the names I gave you both in baptism--and it was, 'I, Maud, take <b>thee,</b> Robert,' <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> before the altar in that little edifice--you will pardon me if I am too familiar with a general officer and his lady" ...|$|R
5000|$|Redfield and {{the other}} members of the group had a huge {{influence}} on twentieth century American landscape painting. In fact, the later American landscape painter, Emile Gruppe, who was not part of this Pennsylvania School of Landscape Painting wrote, [...] "I can still remember the great National Academy shows. Three painters dominated the walls: Edward Redfield, Daniel Garber and Elmer Schofield. They all worked boldly and with wonderful color - and you never critically compared them, for you loved each one <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> in front of his canvas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{will help}} you to tie them. Do you know why I am up so early? It is for your sake. I behaved badly to you last night, for I was cross because you wanted to thwart me about seeing the king. I never thanked you for all you did, you brave Peter, though I thanked you enough in my heart. Do <b>you</b> know that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> there with that sword, {{in the middle of}} those Englishmen, you looked quite noble? Come out into the sunlight, and I will thank you properly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Answer the {{question}} yourself <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> {{face to face}} with the great elephant Jana that has in it an evil spirit, O Macumazana," [...] replied Harût. [...] "Nay, listen. We are far from our home and we sought tidings through those who could give it to us, and we have won those tidings, that is all. We are worshippers of the Heavenly Child that is eternal youth and all good things, but of late the Child has lacked a tongue. Yet to-night it spoke again. Seek to know no more, you who in due season will know all things." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} ways of {{inviting}} a person to seat himself. The genial 'take a pew' of one's equal inspires confidence. The raucous 'sit down in front' of the frenzied pit, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> up {{to get a better}} view of the stage, is not so pleasant. But worst of all is the icy 'sit down' of the annoyed headmaster. In his mouth the words take to themselves new and sinister meanings. They seem to accuse you of nameless crimes, and to warn you that anything you may say will be used against you as evidence.|$|E
60|$|His reductio ad absurdum allowed Wanhope {{to resume}} with a laugh, {{and say that}} Alford waited at the station in the singleness to which the tactful {{dispersion}} of the others had left him, and watched the train rapidly dwindle in the perspective, till an abrupt turn of the road carried it out of sight. Then he lifted his eyes with a long sigh, and looked round. Everywhere he saw Mrs. Yarrow's smiling face with that inner pathos. It swarmed upon him from all points; and wherever he turned it repeated itself in the distances like that succession of faces you see <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> between two mirrors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Grenfell, reflectively, [...] "your {{action on}} one or two {{occasions}} seems to warrant the observation--I mean <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> the boys off me after I'd spoiled their supper, and the other time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> decided on my account not to stay on at the copper-mine. Still, I want to say that while I seem to know I will not make another journey on the gold trail, I've had a subconscious feeling of certainty since sunrise yesterday that the lake lies just ahead of us. I know nothing definite that justifies it, but we'll probably find out to-morrow. There's just another thing. If I leave my bones up here my share falls to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'll not lean too hard," [...] he answered. [...] "I don't {{want your}} fine, {{straight}} back to stoop. I make no demands. I'll not spoil your young life. I'm not worth it. You're {{free to go}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>stand</b> me any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why! I {{remember}} a time, Teddy, {{where there was}} bicycles no end, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> could <b>stand</b> just here--the road was as smooth as a board then--and see twenty or thirty coming and going at the same time, bicycles and moty-bicycles; moty cars, all sorts of whirly things." ...|$|R
