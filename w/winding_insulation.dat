50|$|Small {{dry-type}} and liquid-immersed transformers {{are often}} self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers {{are filled with}} transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that {{the average age of}} failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of <b>winding</b> <b>insulation</b> and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|E

Stator windings are {{the main component of}} generators in which Electrical, magnetically and thermal stresses remain major failures for insulation degradation accelerated aging. A large number of generators failed due to stator <b>winding</b> problems, mainly <b>insulation</b> deterioration. Insulation degradation assessment plays vital role in the asset life management. Mostly the stator failure is catastrophic causing significant damage to the plant. Other than generation loss, stator failure involves heavy repair or replacement cost. Electro thermal analysis is the main characteristic for improvement design of stator slotâs insulation. Dielectric parameters such as insulation thickness, spacing, material types, geometry of winding and slot are major design consideration. A very powerful method available to analyze electro thermal performance is Finite Element Method (FEM) which is used in this paper.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In a cold, wet, or windy environment, cold {{exposure}} can {{be considerable}} for an injured or ill person. The subsequent autonomous stress response initially will increase circulatory and respiratory demands, and as {{body core temperature}} declines, the patient's condition might deteriorate. Therefore, the application of adequate insulation to reduce cold exposure and prevent body core cooling {{is an important part}} of prehospital primary care, but recommendations for what should be used in the field mostly depend on tradition and experience, not on scientific evidence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal insulation properties in different wind conditions of 12 different blankets and rescue bags commonly used by prehospital rescue and ambulance services. METHODS: The thermal manikin and the selected insulation ensembles were setup inside a climatic chamber in accordance to the modified European Standard for assessing requirements of sleeping bags. Fans were adjusted to provide low (< 0. 5 m/s), moderate (2 - 3 m/s) and high (8 - 9 m/s) wind conditions. During steady state thermal transfer, the total resultant insulation value, Itr (m 2 C/Wclo; where C = degrees Celcius, and W = watts), was calculated from ambient air temperature (C), manikin surface temperature (C), and heat flux (W/m 2). RESULTS: In the low <b>wind</b> condition, thermal <b>insulation</b> of the evaluated ensembles correlated to thickness of the ensembles, ranging from 2. 0 to 6. 0 clo (1 clo = 0. 155 m 2 C/W), except for the reflective metallic foil blankets that had higher values than expected. In moderate and high <b>wind</b> conditions, thermal <b>insulation</b> was best preserved for ensembles that were windproof and resistant to the compressive effect of the <b>wind,</b> with <b>insulation</b> reductions down to about 60 - 80 % of the original <b>insulation</b> capacity, whereas <b>wind</b> permeable and/or lighter materials were reduced down to about 30 - 50 % of original insulation capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated insulation ensembles might all be used for prehospital protection against cold, either as single blankets or in multiple layer combinations, depending on ambient temperatures. However, with extended outdoor, on-scene durations, such as during prolonged extrications or in multiple casualty situations, the results of this study emphasize the importance of using a windproof and compression resistant outer ensemble to maintain adequate insulation capacity...|$|R
