25|$|Even before Anisminic, one {{ground on}} which the courts could quash non-jurisdictional errors of law was where they were errors {{on the face of}} the record. An {{application}} for judicial review could be taken if a mistake of law was revealed on a perusal of the record of the proceedings. According to Re Application by Yee Yut Ee (1978), this ground of review is still applicable in Singapore today. In the case, the applicant, who was a company director, challenged an order of the Industrial Arbitration Court ("IAC") which had made him personally liable for paying the retrenchment benefits of the company's employees. The High Court quashed the order, holding that it was patently illegal as it was not authorized by law. Under well-established company law principles, directors are not liable for their companies' debts unless there is proof of fraud, breach of <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> or other exceptional circumstances, and nothing in the Industrial Relations Act which established the IAC, changed this. Even though the Act contained an ouster clause, the clause did not prevent the High Court from intervening when the IAC had committed an error of law which had caused it to act without jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|Where {{the agent}} exceeds his {{authority}} in concluding a contract, the agent {{is liable to}} the third party, not on the contract, but for damages for breach of an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> The measure of damages claimable by the third party {{is the amount of}} loss sustained by the third party because of the non-performance of the intended contract by the principal.|$|E
50|$|Actual {{authority}} {{can be of}} two kinds. Either {{the principal}} may have expressly conferred authority on the agent, or authority may be implied. Authority arises by consent, and whether it exists {{is a question of}} fact. An agent, as a general rule, is only entitled to indemnity from the principal if they have acted within the scope of their actual authority, and if they act outside of that authority they may be in breach of contract, and liable to a third party for breach of the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "It is {{only the}} precise {{analysis}} of this complex of relations into the classical offer and acceptance, with identifiable consideration, that seems to present difficulty, but this same difficulty exists in many situations of daily life, e.g. sales at action; supermarket purchases; boarding an omnibus; purchasing a train ticket; tenders for the supply of goods; offers of reward; acceptance by post; <b>warranties</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> by agents; manufacturers; guarantees; gratuitous bailments; bankers' commercial credits. These are all examples which show that English law, having committed itself to a rather technical and schematic doctrine of contract, in application takes a practical approach, often {{at the cost of}} forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the marked slots of offer, acceptance and consideration." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, an implied {{warranty}} is a contract law term for certain assurances that are {{presumed to be}} made in the sale of products or real property, due to the circumstances of the sale. These assurances are characterized as <b>warranties</b> irrespective <b>of</b> whether the seller has expressly promised them orally or in writing. They include an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness for a particular purpose, an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability for products, implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> workmanlike quality for services, and an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> habitability for a home.|$|R
50|$|Actual {{authority}} {{can be of}} two kinds. Either {{the principal}} may have expressly conferred authority on the agent, or authority may be implied. Authority arises by consensual agreement, and whether it exists {{is a question of}} fact. An agent, as a general rule, is only entitled to indemnity from the principal if he or she has acted within the scope of her actual authority, and may be in breach of contract, and liable to a third party for breach of the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> In tort, a claimant may not recover from the principal unless the agent is acting within the scope of employment.|$|E
50|$|Where an “agent” acts {{on behalf}} of a “principal” who does not exist, or lacks legal capacity, it is {{sometimes}} said that the “agent” is liable personally on the contract. This proposition holds good only when it can be shown, as a matter of construction, that the so-called agent in fact acted as a principal party to the contract. Of course, if the “agent” was aware of the true state of affairs, and acted fraudulently, the agent may be held liable in delict. “So too, perhaps, if the agent acted negligently.” If the agent warranted that he or she had authority to act for the principal, the agent may be held liable for breach of <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
50|$|In The Queen v. Manley, 85 DTC 5150, the {{taxpayer}} {{was hired to}} find a purchaser for the shares of a family-owned company {{in exchange for a}} finder's fee. When he found such a purchaser but was not paid, he sued the former controlling shareholder of the company, who on behalf of the other family shareholders had agreed to pay the finder's fee. The taxpayer was successful in the lawsuit and was awarded damages for the shareholder's breach of <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> In holding that the damages were income from a business, the Federal Court of Appeal held that they were compensation for the failure to receive the finder's fee, which would have been income from a business because {{the taxpayer}} had engaged in an adventure in the nature of trade.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the {{obligation}} is in Article 2, Section 315 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness {{applies to all}} sellers, unlike <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability which applies only to professional merchants. In the United States, this warranty is sometimes referred to simply as a <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness.|$|R
