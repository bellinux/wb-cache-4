Some tracks contained a variation on Codeine's music, such as [...] "Promise of Love", which Raggett characterized as having a [...] "late-night jazz club style" [...] that only contains more traditional Codeine styled music towards the end. Other songs that veried the sound included the piano-based track [...] "W." [...] performed by David Grubbs and quick stuttering guitar riff on [...] "Jr". Immerwhar spoke about the tracks [...] "W."
