When mixed and processed with other materials, the <b>waste</b> <b>salt</b> {{can be stored in}} a durable ceramic waste form (CWF). The development of the CWF has recently progressed from small-scale testing and characterization to full-scale implementation and experimentation using surrogate materials in lieu of the ER electrolyte. Two full-scale (378 kg and 383 kg) CWF test runs have been successfully completed with final densities of 2. 2 g/cm 3 and 2. 1 g/cm 3, respectively. The purpose of the first CWF was to establish material preparation parameters. The emphasis of the second pre-qualification test run was to evaluate a preliminary multi-section CWF container design. Other considerations were to finalize material preparation parameters, measure the material height as it consolidates in the furnace, and identify when cracking occurs during the CWF cooldown process...|$|E

40|$|A {{mineral waste}} form has been {{developed}} for chloride <b>waste</b> <b>salt</b> generated during the pyrochemical treatment of spent nuclear fuel. The waste form consists of salt-occluded zeolite powders bound within a glass matrix. The zeolite contains the salt and immobilizes the fission products. The zeolite powders are hot pressed to form a mechanically stable, durable glass bonded zeolite. Further development of glass bonded zeolite as a waste form requires {{an understanding of the}} interaction between the glass and the zeolite. Properties of the glass that enhance binding and durability of the glass bonded zeolite need to be identified. Three types of glass, boroaluminosilicate, soda-lime silicate, and high silica glasses, have a range of properties and are now being investigated. Each glass was hot pressed by itself and with an equal amount of zeolite. MCC- 1 leach tests were run on both. Soda-lime silicate and high silica glasses did not give a durable glass bonded zeolite. Boroaluminosilicate glasses rich in alkaline earths did bind the zeolite and gave a durable glass bonded zeolite.

Zeolite A could be loaded with a maximum of 3. 8 Cl- ions per pseudo unit cell of the zeolite. To produce a high integral waste form, with a major crystalline phase of a sodium chloride form of sodalite and a free chloride content below 1 wt%, the mixing ratio of <b>waste</b> LiCl <b>salt</b> to zeolite A should be maintained below 0. 25; consolidation with a glass frit above 1188 K is also necessary...|$|R
