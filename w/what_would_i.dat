500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Verdi's refusals {{continued}} as the 1870s progressed. Knowing of {{his interest in}} the soprano Adelina Patti, Ricordi tried to entice him into writing an opera for her, but Verdi's refusal resulted in another approach via a letter to Giuseppina, who was to present the idea at an opportune time. [...] But she confessed defeat yet again. [...] Clara Maffei also tried, unsuccessfully, in March 1878 to interest Verdi, who replied: [...] "For what reason should I write? [...] <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> succeed in doing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{possible}} tactics {{prior to}} the race provided an ongoing discussion among racing fans, as both Nichols Canyon and Faugheen in their careers were keen {{to get in the}} lead but Ruby Walsh later explained: [...] "I viewed it that if Willie Mullins wasn't training Arctic Fire or Nichols Canyon, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> do? That's the way I rode the race". Faugheen went in front approaching the first hurdle but Nichols Canyon came alongside him and forced a strong pace right from the start and the two were closely followed by Arctic Fire. At the third-last hurdle the fight for the lead upfront was beginning to take the toll on the two outsiders who were starting to be left behind. After two more furlongs Nichols Canyon showed the first signs of getting tired following Faugheen's strong gallop and jumped the second last hurdle markedly to his right with jockey Paul Townend pushing along whilst Arctic Fire passed him. Faugheen moved on by four lengths and extended to ten at the last hurdle, at which he showed his characteristic disregard for the small obstacles making a blunder out of it, landing awkwardly but without losing his momentum and being eased off by Ruby Walsh in the last 100 yards, still finishing 15 lengths clear of the runner-up Arctic Fire with a further 13 lengths back to Nichols Canyon.|$|E
