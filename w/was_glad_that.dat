5|$|Speculation also {{surrounded}} whether former series star Kristin Kreuk would reprise {{her role}} as Lana Lang. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{disagreeing with}} many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's {{required}} prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly {{as part of his}} philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. He <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed {{to take part in the}} Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.|$|E

I shall <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> when men hate their common, world-alike clothes, when they tear them up and clothe themselves fiercely for distinction, savage distinction, savage distinction against {{the rest of the}} creeping world: when America kicks the billy-cock and the collar-and-tie into limbo, and takes to her own national costume: when men fiercely react against looking all alike and being all alike, and betake themselves into vivid clan or nation-distinctions.|$|R

500|$|Washington drank in {{moderation}} and precisely recorded gambling wins and losses. He disliked the excessive drinking, gambling, smoking, and profanity that were common in colonial Virginia. Washington grew tobacco but he eventually stopped smoking and considered drunkenness a man's worst vice.

500|$|Rebecca Ford of The Hollywood Reporter <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "tiresome" [...] split glee clubs {{were now}} a single group again, though Flandez called {{the final scene}} [...] "too neat to be an ending". While many reviewers, {{including}} Reiter, approved of the conclusion {{of most of the}} season's storylines in this episode, Canning called it a [...] "nice little reset button for a season that started off with promise but has failed to deliver of late", and Kubicek wrote, [...] "With the return of Sam, it's kind of like the first seven episodes of the season never even happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Film Fodder's Mac Slocum {{said that}} he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> the show [...] "downshifted this week into a far more {{reasonable}} gear".

Keith McDuffee of TV Squad wrote that although he heard [...] "that this episode would be mostly filler", he did not [...] "think that's true". He liked {{the fact that there was}} more revelations of Hurley's background, and enjoyed the [...] "awesome reveals from the other half of downed Oceanic 815".

In the following episode, Hurley comments that he did not expect Rose's husband to be white, before Jack quickly changes the subject. The producers felt it was important to address that they are an interracial couple, and that Hurley was saying what the audience would be thinking. Caldwell agreed with them and thought it would be odd if the issue was not addressed. Anderson also <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Hurley brought up the issue, and liked that Jack did not pay any attention.|$|E

500|$|And the Mountains Echoed {{became the}} first to not deal {{directly}} with the Taliban, which featured prominently in both of his previous works. Though Hosseini did not consciously decide to avoid that topic, he stated that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> he had moved away from {{it in order to}} keep the storyline fresh. The characters' struggles were largely personal and unrelated to the political turmoil in Afghanistan. Hosseini added, [...] "I hope a day will come when we write about Afghanistan, where we can speak about Afghanistan in a context outside of the wars and the struggles of the last 30 years. In some way I think this book is an attempt to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Morse, however, gained mainly {{positive}} {{responses to}} {{his portrayal of}} Tritter. The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall called Morse a [...] "superb actor", and Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune stated that Morse's [...] "understated performance" [...] made Tritter all the more scary. Zap2it's Daniel Fienberg regarded Morse as [...] "one of our very best character actors". Cynthia Littleton of Variety, who already considered Morse's work in St. Elsewhere Emmy-worthy, <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Morse's submission of the episode [...] "Finding Judas" [...] for a 2007 Emmy Awards consideration was accepted {{in the category of}} [...] "Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series".

500|$|Another leading countercultural figure, the beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg, was a {{supporter}} of Prabhupada. He had met the swami earlier in New York and assisted him in extending his United States visa. Despite disagreeing with many of Prabhupada's required prohibitions, especially the ones pertaining to drugs and promiscuity, Ginsberg often publicly sang the Hare Krishna mantra, which he had learned in India. He made the mantra part of his philosophy and declared that it [...] "brings a state of ecstasy." [...] He <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Prabhupada, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America.

500|$|Also in 2004, Beckinsale portrayed Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator. Scorsese {{decided to}} cast Beckinsale because, [...] "I’ve always liked her. I’ve seen all her work, and I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> {{she agreed to}} audition." [...] Beckinsale's {{performance}} received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of New York Magazine said she played the part [...] "in full va-va-voom blossom" [...] while LaSalle felt that she manages [...] "to convince us that Ava {{was one of the}} great broads of all time." [...] However, Clark described it as [...] "the one performance that doesn't come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)" [...] while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that [...] "Gardner's rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role as if she was advertising perfume." [...] The film grossed over $213million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal {{described}} the episode as [...] "a {{turning point for}} Glee", commenting that although there had previously been criticism {{of many of the}} characters for being [...] "one note", this episode demonstrated that was not the case, showing that Will has a playful side, Sue has feelings, and Puck is able to [...] "emerge from his bonehead-punk exterior". Andrea Reiher of Zap2it <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Will's wife Terri did not appear in the episode, commenting: [...] "I like Jessalyn Gilsig but that character drives me outhouse-rat crazy."

500|$|Dmitry Samarov from Chicago Reader found {{contrast}} in the author's description of Madonna's rising popularity {{and her own}} indie rock music career. To him, the most interesting portion was when Simone realized {{in the book that}} the singer's output was simply enjoyed by people because [...] "it makes them happy". Samarov, who professed {{that he did not have}} much interest in Madonna's career, <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Madonnaland was [...] written about one's [...] "success and failure". The National Public Radio network of the United States listed Madonnaland as one of their Best Books of 2016. Critic Michael Schaub analyzed the subject and felt that Simone's humorous method of writing was also [...] "a perceptive, compassionate one". Schaub also reviewed the release for Men's Journal where he commented about Simone's viewpoint on pop music fandom and its inclusion in the book. Kirkus Reviews writer Craig Marks found the portions where the author wrote about her previous profession as a dancer as [...] "stunning" [...] and called the book a [...] "provocative analysis".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the eighth most-watched {{program of the}} week along with NBC's Sunday Night Football, with 11.4 million viewers, it {{received}} a 17 share in the ratings. Overall, the episode was well received by critics. Nina Hämmerling Smith of TV Guide quoted: [...] "Perhaps {{the best thing about}} the episode was the amount of screen time given to old favorites like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). The show's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House, and I was thrilled to see more of that". Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad, wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> he wasn't. He also quoted, [...] "For some reason I like Taub. Maybe because he's not pretty like the rest of them. He's just an everyday schlub who's a pretty decent doctor".|$|E
500|$|Allan Mazur {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} the American Journal of Sociology. He called it an excellent and comprehensive survey, and said he found very few errors, though for instance squirrel monkeys did have dominance hierarchies. But he found the chapter on Man disappointing: it was trite, value-loaded, or wrong; used data uncritically, {{and seemed to be}} based on [...] "Gerhard and Jean Lenski's introductory textbook". Further, he agreed with Wilson that scientific theories must be falsifiable, and stated [...] "I claim that the bulk of Wilson's theorizing is not falsifiable and therefore is of little value." [...] This was because Wilson's [...] "theorizing" [...] was sometimes tautologous, sometimes hopelessly vague, and sometimes based on unobservable past events. For instance, Mazur argued that Wilson's claim that altruism has evolved in most social species is untestable: Mazur denied that a mother's action to save her baby is altruistic, as (by kin selection) it increases her own fitness. However, Mazur <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Wilson has [...] "legitimate the biological approach to sociology", even if other books like Robert Hinde's 1974 Biological Bases of Human Social Behaviour were of more use to sociologists.|$|E
