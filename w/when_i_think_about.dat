500|$|Back in Ainola, Sibelius busied {{himself by}} making new {{arrangements}} of old songs. However, his mind returned frequently to the now apparently moribund symphony. In February 1943 {{he told his}} secretary, Santeri Levas, that he hoped to complete a [...] "great work" [...] before he died, but blamed the war for his inability to make progress: [...] "I cannot sleep at nights <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] In June he discussed the symphony with his future son-in-law Jussi Jalas and provided another reason for its non-completion: [...] "For each of my symphonies I have developed a special technique. It can't be something superficial, {{it has to be}} something that has been lived though. In my new work I am struggling with precisely these issues." [...] Sibelius also told Jalas that all rough sketches and drafts were to be burned after his death; he did not want anyone labelling these rejected scraps as [...] "Sibelius letzten [...] Gedanken" [...] (Sibelius's last thoughts).|$|E

The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Hollis was a 25-year-old {{insurance}} agent {{at the time}} of the attack. He was born September 25, 1920. He lived at 3502 N. State Line Avenue; a house which no longer exists. On the night of his attack, he was at the movies on a double date with his brother, Bob, who was also an {{insurance agent}}. After the movie, he dropped his brother and his date off. While he was taking his girlfriend home, they stopped on a lateral road off of Richmond where the attack occurred. Hollis suffered three fractures in his skull and was hospitalized for several days at Texarkana Hospital (also known as Pine Street Hospital) which stood at W. 5th and Pine street and no longer exists. He was in critical condition. After four days, he showed slight improvement but was still not fully conscious. He was released from the hospital on Saturday, March 9. His doctor told him it would be [...] "some time" [...] before he was completely well again and that he was not to work for six months. By the middle of May, he was still recovering from his injuries. Three months after the attack, he stated [...] "I still get nervous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. At night, on the street, even downtown." [...] Hollis was questioned several times by officers after the other killings. Starting at the end of April, he spent a week with Larey in Frederick, Oklahoma before residing in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hollis eventually married and had seven children. He had a Bachelor of Arts in history and a Master of Science in Public Administration. He worked for the US government. He loved to dress in western clothing, including a cowboy hat, a holster and a pistol. He appeared in the 1971 television film They've Killed President Lincoln as Vice President Andrew Johnson. He eventually moved to Houston where he began working for NASA. Hollis died in his sleep at the age of 54. His family remembered him for his jokes and sense of humor, as well as his love for the outdoors, including camping and hunting.|$|E

Long ago I learned that days devoted to reading are a luxury; something that surprises friends and family who are not professors. But I found my thoughts turning more to the everyday than the profound. As a result, this is a more personal view of regional science, which draws on my experiences and my training in both institutional economics and regional economics. I will start with some of those experiences and the questions they raised for me about the importance of institutions 1 in regional development and some of the difficulties of doing comparative regional research. While I include regions at many levels of aggregation, my particular interest is how to incorporate institutions into the analysis of regional differences in economic development. I want to explore what literature and methods are out there that can provide insights into better ways of incorporating institutions into comparative regional research...|$|R

I was also aware that I was forgoing an opportunity: the Chinese language had been so polluted by revolutionary movements and political jargon that there was great room for improvement.

She says: <b>When</b> <b>I</b> see old CCTV/HK/Taiwan TV programs, it brings me back to my childhood. I’m not sure how far I should identify with or support Chinathough.

I wanted to reach inside their minds and bring out all of the knowledge they have gained from their field experiences. I received a list of names from my adviser, Bonnie Turner (Elementary Education Instructor), and I sent out nearly thirty surveys to first and second year teachers across the state of Indiana and beyond. Twelve people responded, and the advice, insights, tips, and knowledge they shared with me was priceless. I compiled all of the information onto a contemporary website that would appeal to students my age. I incorporated the use of multi-media (photos and video), and I made sure to include a list of highly recommended books and websites for young teachers. This idea came to me after several teachers recommended the same book over and over again, and I thought, "There must be something going on here [...] . "The finished website turned out better than I ever thought it could. I am very proud of it, and I hope that it is used as a resource for pre-service teachers to help calm their anxieties and give them a bright (and realistic) perspective of the "real world" of teaching.

5000|$|In the mid-1970s, Pumerantz's {{experience}} and accomplishments {{caught the eye}} {{of a small group of}} osteopathic physicians in California on the hunt for a leader. Battered by years of second-class citizen status - even threatened with extinction when their ability to license new osteopaths was taken away by voters in 1962—the state's osteopathic practitioners, armed with a resurrected ability to license following a California Supreme Court decision, had joined forces to bring an osteopathic medical school to the state. Pumerantz, though officially behind the idea in his AOA role, didn't think a new osteopathic school in California stood a chance. [...] "There was just too much lined up against it, and too many people who said it couldn't be done," [...] he remembered.But then he started getting regular phone calls from a who's who of California osteopathic physicians—Richard Eby, Ethan Allen, Viola Fryman, and others—seeking his expertise. They eventually pitched him the idea that he was the right person to establish a new educational foothold for their profession in California."I had a list of reasons why it wouldn’t work, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it later, <b>I</b> realized a list of obstacles really was a plan to starting such a school," [...] Pumerantz recalled. [...] "You just needed to find a way around the obstacles."Pumerantz finally agreed to lead the new school, and on the day after Labor Day 1977, a president and his college—the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific—were born on a largely abandoned shopping mall in downtown Pomona, California.COMP's first class of 36 osteopathic medical students was admitted in October 1978. Despite a host of hurdles - including newly proposed anti-osteopathy legislation, the demands of accrediting bodies, and resistance from local businessmen who wanted retail firms, rather than a nonprofit school, to be in the empty mall spaces—Pumerantz and his allies had by that point acquired the former JC Penney building to go along with his first small office. They'd built classrooms, offices and an anatomy lab in a few thousand square feet of former retail buildings.|$|R
