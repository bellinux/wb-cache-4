5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string <b>windings</b> on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E
5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted <b>windings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its <b>windings</b> increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

25|$|The BLDC motor's {{characteristic}} trapezoidal back-emf waveform {{is derived}} partly from the stator <b>windings</b> being evenly distributed, and partly from {{the placement of}} the rotor's PMs. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator <b>windings</b> of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use Hall effect sensors mounted on their <b>windings</b> for rotor position sensing and low cost closed-loop control of the electronic commutator.|$|E
25|$|A commutated DC motor has {{a set of}} {{rotating}} <b>windings</b> {{wound on}} an armature mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor <b>windings</b> as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating <b>windings.</b> Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Tony Wilds {{observed}} [...] "A strict surf album this is not, despite the packaging {{and a few}} titles. More is really the classic, best-selling album launching Kai <b>Winding's</b> mod sound.

25|$|The {{magnetic}} flux {{created by the}} field <b>windings</b> follows {{the path of least}} magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque.

25|$|The {{ignition}} coil {{consists of two}} transformer <b>windings</b> — the primary and secondary. These <b>windings</b> share a common magnetic core.

50|$|Leakage {{inductance}} {{derives from}} the electrical property of an imperfectly-coupled transformer whereby each winding behaves as a self-inductance constant in series with the <b>winding's</b> respective ohmic resistance constant, these four winding constants also interacting with the transformer's mutual inductance constant. The winding self-inductance constant and associated leakage inductance is due to leakage flux not linking with all turns of each imperfectly-coupled winding.|$|R

The accident of the electrical grid is divided into a single, a double, a third line-to-ground faults and a double, a third line-to-line faults. A single line-to-ground fault accounts for nearly 75 [%] among them. In this research, when a Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCL) {{was applied to the}} three phase power system, operation in a single line-to-ground fault and limiting characteristics of fault current according to turns ratio of third winding were analyzed. When a single line-to-ground fault happened, secondary <b>winding’s</b> circuit was open. Then third <b>winding’s</b> circuit with a SFCL was closed. So fault current was limited by diverted circuit. At this time, we could find out that size of the limited fault current could be changed according to third winding rate. We confirmed that limiting operation of the fault current was carried out within one-period. These results will be utilized in adjusting the size of the SFCL...|$|R
