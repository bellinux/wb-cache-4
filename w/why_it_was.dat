5|$|June 1990: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Boris briefly caused heavy rainfall in southern California. This {{was one of}} the reasons <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the wettest June in San Diego, since record-keeping began in 1850. Despite this, less than an inch (25mm) of rain fell in most locations.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bonnie, a {{professor}} of law and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Law, mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so easily bent toward the repressive objectives of the state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state {{as one of the most}} substantial lessons from the period.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried {{to explain why the}} German people {{themselves}} had not rebelled against Nazi rule, <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary for outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{introduces the}} Digital Preservation Coalition Technology Watch Report 'Preserving Computer-Aided Design'. It provides {{an introduction to}} CAD, explaining what <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important, and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> challenging to preserve. It describes CAD standards and common formats, and reviews techniques and approaches for preserving CAD models...|$|R
40|$|Recent astrophysical {{observations}} seem {{to indicate}} that the cosmological constant is small but nonzero and positive. The old cosmological constant problem asks <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so small; we must now ask, in addition, <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nonzero (and is in the range found by recent observations), and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> positive. In this essay, we try to kill these three metaphorical birds with one stone. That stone is the unimodular theory of gravity, which is the ordinary theory of gravity, except for the way the cosmological constant arises in the theory...|$|R
5|$|HD 154672 is {{a yellow}} subgiant (spectral type G3 IV). It is about 65 parsecs {{away from the}} Sun that is larger than, but of a similar mass to, the Sun. However, HD 154672 is much older. The star is very metal-rich, {{which is one of}} the reasons <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{targeted}} for a planet search by the N2K Consortium, which discovered the gas giant planet HD 154672 b using Doppler Spectroscopy; the discovery was reported in October 2008. The N2K collaboration chose HD 154672 primarily because it aimed to discover the correlation between a star's metallicity and the mass of orbiting planets.|$|E
5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|Lucidi {{offered to}} let Edgardo's father {{accompany}} {{them to the}} inquisitor {{to discuss the matter}} with him—Momolo refused—then allowed Momolo to send his eldest son Riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna's uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna's Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna's brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> thought that Edgardo had been baptised, saying that this was confidential. When the men begged him to at least give the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to this effect to pass on to the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras' bedroom and watch over Edgardo.|$|E

5|$|Mongolia's central {{geographical}} {{position on}} the Asian continent was an important reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> able to play such {{a large role in}} the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travellers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Confederation in 1867, the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom {{served in}} Canada as {{the symbol of}} royal authority. Arms had not been granted {{to any of the}} colonies in British North America, apart from 17th-century grants to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The year after Confederation, arms were granted by Royal Warrant on May 26, 1868 to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia (that Nova Scotia had been granted arms was forgotten, and it took until 1929 for the {{historic}} arms granted in the 17th century to be reinstated) and New Brunswick. In the Royal Warrant of 1868, Queen Victoria authorized the four arms of the first provinces to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada and while this was not done for the first Great Seal, it is through this reference it became the de facto arms for Canada until 1921. That is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in this form Canada was represented on the first Red Ensign carried by Canadian troops at Vimy Ridge in 1917.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of Texas, a drawing surfaced showing that the car was potentially to be called Z Tavio. John DeLorean's middle name and his son's first name were both Zachary while Tavio was his father's name and his son's middle name. Due to only sporadic documentation, there is little more that is currently known about the Z Tavio name and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ultimately rejected {{in favor of the}} DMC-12.|$|E
25|$|Next, Wentworth {{surveyed}} the major Catholic landowners in Leinster for similar treatment, {{including members of}} the powerful Butler dynasty. Wentworth's plans were interrupted by {{the outbreak of the}} Bishops Wars in Scotland, which eventually resulted in Wentworth's execution by the English Parliament and civil war in England and Ireland. Wentworth's constant questioning of Catholic land titles was one of the major causes of the 1641 Rebellion, and the principal reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> joined by Ireland's wealthiest and most powerful Catholic families.|$|E
25|$|Following more {{experimentation}} in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide ("New {{experiments with}} the vacuum"), which detailed basic rules describing {{to what degree}} various liquids could be supported by air pressure.
