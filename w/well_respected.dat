5|$|Although highly decorated, honoured and <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> for his work, Muller {{was not an}} easy person. This shows {{through in}} a {{consistently}} bad press he received during his lifetime and after, which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is a <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> falconry bird {{due to its}} strong hunting ability, high trainability, versatility, {{and in recent years}} availability via captive breeding. It is effective on most game bird species from small to large.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> in his {{profession}} and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon, who {{had been}} <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> in Egypt and had earned himself the {{nickname}} Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered {{the closing of the}} mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.|$|E
5|$|When Gothenburg left Port Darwin on Tuesday, 16 February 1875, Captain Robert George Augustus Pearce {{was under}} orders to make best {{possible}} speed. Pearce {{had been her}} captain on the Adelaide-Darwin run {{for some time and}} had built up a solid reputation. He was a man of the sea, a man of sobriety and kindness and was <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> by his fellow sea captains.|$|E
5|$|Bugle rank {{consists}} of the Band Commander and eleven other senior cadets who are <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> in the band and have impeccable marching abilities. Each bugle rank member carries a bugle with a banner, but are never played during a performance. Together, the drum majors and bugle rank lead the band through the maneuvers on the field. In addition to their primary functions within the band, the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers, much as a rifleman would salute with a rifle or a commander would salute with a sabre.|$|E

5|$|During his {{lifetime}} H.P.N. Muller was <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> for his work. He was extensively decorated by {{almost all the}} countries he worked for or in, in many cases with the highest distinction. He was made a Knight Grand Cross in military and civilian orders of Portugal, Liberia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands, was commander of the French Legion of Honour, and knight in orders of Liberia, Annam and the Netherlands. Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him.|$|E
5|$|Following the Wales Test Dixon and the WRU {{continued}} to clash over referee appointments. The dispute escalated {{to the point}} where Dixon threatened {{to pull out of the}} All Blacks' remaining Welsh fixtures. The WRU responded by threatening to cancel the fixtures if their referee choices were rejected. The dispute was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as referee for the final three matches. Gil Evans had refereed the All Blacks versus England Test and was <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> by the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|In 1821 the Royal Academy {{accepted}} and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, {{and many of}} Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> {{for his ability to}} capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty tried over the next decade to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures.|$|E

The painting was extremely well received, {{and many of}} Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. He became <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. In the decade following the exhibition of Cleopatra Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings.|$|E
5|$|In July 1938, {{at the age}} of 23, Dundas was {{commissioned}} as a pilot officer in No. 609 Squadron RAF, a Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron. Hugh and John's godfather had set up the unit. At that time, the squadron was manned by part-time civilians and was equipped with Hawker Hind bombers. It was converted from a bomber to a fighter aircraft squadron and later, in August 1939, re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire. John Dundas was <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> by his peers and he frequently flew his commanding officer's Hind.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1850, Joseph Terry {{had been}} granted freedom of the city due to the {{economic}} growth York was seeing fueled by his company's success. Chairmanships of local guilds were to follow; with York's Merchant Taylor's and Merchant Adventurer's both seeing the benefit of representation from a <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> and moneyed benefactor. Other local organizations followed suit; with the York Art Gallery, Horticultural Society and local waterworks company all receiving funding and financial direction {{by the end of}} his career. He further assisted in the duties of the York Cricket Club, promoting their historic move to Bootham Crescent in 1881, whilst concurrently serving on advisory panels for both the County Lunatic Asylum and the local Sunday School Committee.|$|E

5|$|Russell was a {{prominent}} businessman, <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> among his peers and the community. Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855 they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell. They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.|$|E
5|$|After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev became {{leader of}} the Soviet Union and began a process of de-Stalinisation, citing Lenin's writings, {{including}} those on Stalin, to legitimise this process. When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of glastnost and perestroika, he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles. In late 1991, amid {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study. Yeltsin did not dismantle the Lenin mausoleum, recognising that Lenin was too popular and <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> among the Russian populace for this to be viable.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would provide}} the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E

30|$|Through {{our case}} study {{simulation}} we have demonstrated how {{the use of}} a subset of network information can lead to an approximately optimal solution. We have also demonstrated the coordinated, distributed algorithm’s ability to improve local state estimation of voltages and to perform <b>well</b> with <b>respect</b> to cost minimisation when compared to centralized solutions. Also, we have shown that even in the presence of asynchronous information exchange, the coordinated, distributed approach can converge to a near optimal solution. Finally, we have demonstrated the algorithm’s ability to scale <b>well</b> with <b>respect</b> to the number of local controllers.|$|R

5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, {{as men and women}} in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were <b>well</b> <b>respected.</b> These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E

5|$|Juan Larrea {{was born}} on June 24, 1782, {{in the city of}} Mataró, Catalonia. His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea, {{who was in charge of}} customs {{operations}} in Mataró, and his mother was Tomasa Espeso. He studied mathematics and navigation, and focused his education towards a career in commerce. His father died in 1793, so Larrea became the patriarch of the family. They moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a warehouse for wines, leather, and sugar. He traded with Peru, Upper Peru, Paraguay, Chile and colonial Brazil. By 1806 he was a <b>well</b> <b>respected</b> businessman, and a syndic of the Royal Consulate. He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court, to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce the privileges of peninsular merchants.|$|E
