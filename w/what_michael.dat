On a more superficial level, this is Sony milking his legacy. Any true MJ fan will already own 90% of the songs that make up this two-disc set.

500|$|Tintin in the Congo shows Tintin {{taking part}} in <b>what</b> <b>Michael</b> Farr {{described}} as [...] "the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter" [...] of animals; {{over the course of}} the Adventure, Tintin shoots several antelope, kills an ape to wear its skin, rams a rifle vertically into a crocodile's open mouth, injures an elephant for ivory, stones a buffalo, and (in earlier editions) drills a hole into a rhinoceros before planting dynamite in its body, blowing it up from the inside. Such scenes reflect the popularity of big-game hunting among whites and affluent visitors in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1930s. Hergé later felt guilty about his portrayal of animals in Tintin in the Congo and became an opponent of blood sports; when he wrote Cigars of the Pharaoh (1934), he had Tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the Indian jungle.|$|E
500|$|... "Time Capsule" [...] {{continued}} <b>what</b> <b>Michael</b> Schur {{described as}} one of the primary story arcs of the third season: Ben Wyatt gradually falling in love not only with Leslie Knope, but with the town of Pawnee itself. This is particularly illustrated by how impressed Ben is with the Pawnee citizens who make impassioned cases for what they want inside the Pawnee time capsule: although he still considers them weirdos, he respectfully calls them [...] "weirdos who care". During the cold open, while discussing the time capsule, Leslie describes several former Pawnee town slogans. After each slogan, the camera switches to a different cut of Leslie reading another. This method of comedic narrative is frequently used in Parks and Recreation, in which Poehler and the other actors improvise several different jokes and the editors slice them all together into one scene.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it {{said the}} episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] and that Jenna Fischer was [...] "fantastic", {{but he felt}} the episode was less {{outright}} funny than recent episodes. But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things slow down a bit as we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner. It feels {{a bit like the}} episode is marking time – which is exactly <b>what</b> <b>Michael</b> is doing with his final two weeks on the job."

500|$|Around {{the start}} of 2003, the Schindlers began to create more {{publicity}} by lobbying for their case to keep their daughter alive. They selected pro-life activist Randall Terry as their spokesman and continued to pursue their available legal options.

Accompanying the petition were four affidavits {{from members of the}} Schindler family and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon. At the hearing, the Schindlers' counsel read into the record additional affidavits from three speech professionals and two nurses. In particular, Nurse Carla Sauer lyer asserted {{that she was able to}} feed Terri Schiavo orally but that Michael characterized any such interaction as [...] "therapy" [...] and ordered her not to do so. Iyer claimed in her affidavit that her initial training in 1996 consisted solely of the instruction, [...] "Do <b>what</b> <b>Michael</b> Schiavo tells you or you're terminated," [...] and that standing orders were not to contact the Schindler family, but that she [...] "would call them anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Wadhams, Nathan, and Lindsay {{describe}} {{the style of}} the Shirelles early work as [...] "tight, almost doo-wop harmony". Owens' vocals, described by rock n' roll writer Alwyn W. Turner as being [...] "wonderfully expressive", were capable of sounding [...] "almost, but not quite" [...] out of tune, which in his opinion led to Owens' sounding innocent in her songs; music critic Albin Zak describes her vocals as being able to intone desire and vulnerability. The other members, singing backup, also convey <b>what</b> <b>Michael</b> Campbell, a professor of music at Western Illinois University, calls a [...] "naive schoolgirl sound". The lyrics sung by the Shirelles tended to be fairly simple and [...] "barely" [...] concealed the subtexts of the songs. The songs were implicitly directed at female listeners, with the male subjects of songs being referred to as [...] "he" [...] instead of [...] "you"; this was a change from previous female-written songs, which tended to be more gender neutral, and helped pave the way for the [...] "confessional" [...] songs of 70s singers like Joni Mitchell and Carole King.|$|E

Universities dismissed Jewish students and faculty. German pharmaceutical companies tested drugs on camp prisoners; other companies built the crematoria. As prisoners entered the death camps, they were ordered to surrender all personal property, which was catalogued and tagged before it was sent to Germany to be reused or recycled.

Studio Proteus' initial output was predominantly science fiction and action; this may have reflected Smith's tastes as a writer and member of SFWA, but also reflected the tastes of the American comics direct market (who were the primary purchasers of manga at that time) and manga fandom of the 1980s and 1990s.

[...] People may also experience the intense stress of helplessness. When they make repeated attempts to compel their loved one to return and are unsuccessful, they feel helpless and inadequate to the task. [...] This helplessness causes people to feel possessed of <b>what</b> <b>Michael</b> Balint calls “a limited capacity to perform the work of conquest – the work necessary to transform an indifferent object into a participating partner.” [...] According to Balint, feeling one’s ‘limited capacity’ is traumatic in that it produces a fault line in the psyche which renders the person vulnerable heightened emotional responses within primary relationships.|$|E

2500|$|The Qianlong Emperor was a {{successful}} military leader. Immediately after ascending the throne, he sent armies to suppress the Miao rebellion. His later campaigns greatly expanded the territory controlled by the Qing Empire. This was made possible not only by Qing military might, {{but also by the}} disunity and declining strength of the Inner Asian peoples. Under the Qianlong Emperor's reign, the Dzungar Khanate was incorporated into the Qing Empire's rule and renamed Xinjiang, while to the west, Ili was conquered and garrisoned. The incorporation of Xinjiang into the Qing Empire resulted from the final defeat and destruction of the Dzungars (or Zunghars), a coalition of Western Mongol tribes. The Qianlong Emperor then ordered the Dzungar genocide. According to the Qing dynasty scholar Wei Yuan, 40% of the 600,000 Dzungars were killed by smallpox, 20% fled to the Russian Empire or Kazakh tribes, and 30% were killed by the Qing army, in <b>what</b> <b>Michael</b> Edmund Clarke described as [...] "the complete destruction of not only the Zunghar state but of the Zunghars as a people."

Chapple passed the landmark of 800first-class wickets in May 2011 during a match against Warwickshire. His 800th wicket was that of batsman William Porterfield.
