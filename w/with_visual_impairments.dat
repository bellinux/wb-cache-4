Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E

METHOD: 26 children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (mean age: 3 years 7 months (SD 3 months); 17 boys) and 28 children with normal vision (mean age: 3 years 7 months (SD 4 months); 14 boys) participated in the study. The ManuVis age band for 3 -year-old children comprised two one-handed tasks, two two-handed tasks, and a pre-writing task. RESULTS: Children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> needed more time on all tasks (p <. 01) and performed the pre-writing task less accurately than children with normal vision (p <. 001). Children aged 42 - 47 months performed significantly faster on two tasks and had better total scores than children aged 36 - 41 months (p <. 05). Inter-rater reliability was excellent (Intra-class Correlation Coefficient = 0. 96 - 0. 99).

40|$|Although {{computer}} assisted learning (CAL) {{is becoming increasingly}} popular, people <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> face greater difficulty in accessing computer-assisted learning facilities.

40|$|This Master thesis aims at {{developing}} {{knowledge on}} what music therapy can afford for children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their sighted caregivers {{in terms of}} bonding and early interaction. Children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their sighted caregivers, due to their vulnerable situation and their different perception style, often experience challenges in interaction, communication and bonding. The focus in this article-based Master thesis is on how musical interaction can contribute to bonding and early interaction. The study aims to give answers to the following research question: “What can joint music making afford children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their caregivers in terms of bonding and social interaction?” A qualitative, exploratory study in which children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (aged 1 to 4) and their caregivers participated in music therapy sessions over 10 weeks was conducted in a pedagogical institution for people <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Data has been collected by participant observation, field notes, video recordings and interviews. Moments of positive interactions in music were selected and analyzed and the selections were triangulated by interviews with caregivers. The data-material indicates that music therapy promotes positive bonding patterns and enhances early interaction by providing experiences of togetherness, joint attention and happiness. Musical interaction seems to facilitate elements of early interaction that can be challenging for children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their sighted caregivers. This thesis discusses the findings in the broader perspective of disability studies and community music therapy and argues that music therapy promotes positive interactions and empowerment of children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their caregivers. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{challenges}} experienced by learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in two mainstream schools in Klerksdorp, Dr Kenneth Kaunda District. The aim is to describe the challenges experienced by visually impaired learners and how they are truly included in the mainstream school curriculum, to analyse the nature of support as well as the adaptation and accommodation made for learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in the mainstream schools. I purposefully selected the participants and used semi-structured interviews; observation method was also used to enhance the information collected during the interviews. A qualitative research approach was followed, underpinned by interpretive method as a paradigm. The participants included in two schools in Dr Kenneth Kaunda District were four teachers teaching learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (two from each school), two parents of learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> four learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (two from each school), one specialist (itinerant) teacher designated to assist and support learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in both schools and two principal (one from each school). A total of thirteen participants were involved in this study. The data were audio-recorded for accurate transcription and analysis. From the research it was found that even though the learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are now physically integrated in the mainstream classes, they are not yet truly included. The teachers are not adequately supported and trained and most of the parents of learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are not involved in their children’s schooling. The teaching methods and materials are not adequately adapted for them and the physical environment within the classes and school grounds are not yet truly accessible for them. The school needs resources and change in teachers’ attitude; teachers do not understand the rationale behind inclusive education. Finally, the vision and mission statements of the school were drafted but did not provide a clear and practical guideline towards the inclusion of learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> I hope that the findings of this study will be of valuable use to both schools in Dr Kenneth Kaunda District and to the Ministry of Basic Education with regard to progress in the inclusion of LVI in the mainstream.

The general objective set for the theoretical part of this bachelor thesis is to map specific features of socialization of older school-aged children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in respect to choice of their future profession. The objective of the practical part was to use qualitative research to reflect the current situation in career consulting for children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in selected school and consulting establishments and to find out about notions that children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have of their future professions and the world of labor. A qualitative method of research, specifically a structured interview technique, was used to meet the objective of the practical part, which was divided into two partial objectives. The interviews were conducted with 6 respondents in total, which included 1 worker of a school establishment, 1 worker of a consulting establishment and 4 schoolchildren <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> aged 13 - 15 years. Questions for the schoolchildren were prepared based on materials used in the theoretical part and they were divided into two sections. The first section of questions concerned basic case history data of the children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their notions about their future profession, while the other section was in form of a didactic test which consisted of questions from the world of labor and its results were supposed to illustrate how well the children understand the world of labor. To meet the other partial objective I have also used a structured interview with a worker of a school establishment and with a teacher with a specific training from a special teaching establishment. The obtained information was processed and it has enabled brief mapping of the current situation in the career consulting for schoolchildren <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in the South Bohemian region. The qualitative research of adequacy of notions that children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have of their future career has brought quite surprising conclusions.
