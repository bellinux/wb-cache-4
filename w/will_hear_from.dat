500|$|After {{questioning}} {{several of}} Mahoney's former associates, drug supplier Wilkie Collins (Robert F. Chew) is pressured into telling Lewis and Falsone the shooter was Mahoney's nephew, Junior Bunk (Mekhi Phifer). They arrest Junior Bunk {{and find the}} matching gun, a Desert Eagle pistol prompting Bunk to admit he shot at the police to [...] "send a message" [...] from his mother, Georgia Rae Mahoney (Hazelle Goodman), {{over the death of}} her brother, Luther. Georgia is arrested trying to flee in a jet to the Cayman Islands, where she used to handle Luther's drug money. Meanwhile, following Brierre's autopsy, Cox (Michelle Forbes) finds somebody had consensual sex with the victim before her death. Pembleton and Bayliss learn from Felix Wilson's daughter Thea (Ellen Bethea) that Brierre had a vicious and abusive ex-boyfriend named Kaja. Pembleton and Gee declare Kaja the primary suspect, despite protests from Ballard that the lead is thin and that they have not properly questioned Felix Wilson. The episode ends with an imprisoned Georgia Rae Mahoney stating Kellerman <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> her soon.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1888–1889, he worked briefly for several companies: Pratt & Whitney in Hartford, Connecticut; Eaton, Cole and Burnham Co. in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and a plant in Scottdale, Pennsylvania. Roe (1937) surmised that Hartness {{developed}} {{the idea of the}} flat-turret lathe sometime before this period and sought a suitable machine tool company at which to build it. Only Ambrose Swasey of Warner & Swasey. saw the potential for success of Hartness' idea, reportedly saying [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> that young man again, and from this 'Lazy Susan' of his".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have already}} told thee," [...] {{answered}} Halbert Glendinning, sternly, [...] "that I <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> nothing <b>from</b> thee that savours of doctrine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First," [...] {{said the}} Sergeant, [...] "you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> {{something}} <b>from</b> the Yollands--when the postman delivers Rosanna's letter at Cobb's Hole, on Monday next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If our hastily {{constructed}} {{theory is}} correct," [...] remarked John O'Gorman's daughter, [...] "Papa Jones <b>will</b> soon <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Alora's abductor, with a financial proposition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{tell him}} that I have seen you," [...] I answered, [...] "that you are well, and that he <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> you to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{intention}} of telling you where Mrs. Leslie is," [...] asserted Geoffrey. [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> her when she considers it advisable to write." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "as {{soon as he}} is safe. He must have had enough else to think about, poor fellow." ...|$|E
60|$|George, {{with his}} wife, children, sister and mother, {{embarked}} for Africa, some few weeks after. If {{we are not}} mistaken, the world <b>will</b> yet <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him there.|$|R
60|$|GARDINER. I do but {{bring the}} message, know no more. Your Grace <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> her reasons <b>from</b> herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you not yet discovered? Unless you pay, {{your friends}} <b>will</b> never <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> you again. Il Duca, by his mother's favor, is king here. He will murder {{you if you}} oppose his demands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And they'll {{hear from}} me," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "and {{the fellow who}} sent them out to run the cars for us <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me, too," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, good-morning, Miss Houghton. You <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me, and I from you. I {{wish you}} a {{pleasant}} experience in your new occupation. You are not leaving Woodhouse for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye. I am just {{starting}} for the Continent, on sudden and urgent business. What my destination is I hardly {{can tell you}} yet. You <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me {{in the course of}} the summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, George, don't you think--you are on {{such good}} terms with Mrs. Hale and her mother--that you might {{tell them the}} whole story? That is, tell it in your own way; they <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> {{anything}} <b>from</b> you, and believe it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks. I {{hope that}} you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> soon <b>from</b> Mr. Smith. I am going down the river; and if I should see {{anything}} of the Aurora I shall {{let him know that}} you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{meant to}} have written you a long letter, but I find I cannot. If any thing {{remarkable}} occurs, you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> it <b>from</b> me--if good; if bad, {{there are plenty}} to tell it. In the mean time, do you be happy.|$|R
60|$|Therefore I {{should have}} {{answered}} your letter at once if I {{had not been}} seized with illness. Indeed, my dear, dear friend, you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me no excuses. I have not been unkind, simply incapable.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not afraid," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "but I doubt whether {{he may not}} be too many for me. At any rate, I will try it. You <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me as I go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Ben and Gilbert. I am [...] expecting a letter every day. It's queer you didn't go with [...] them, but I suppose the old Columbia with her crew suits [...] you better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a {{cruel and}} {{stubborn}} man, Vont," [...] he continued. [...] "You have gone {{far out of}} your way to bring injury and unhappiness upon me. All your efforts are as nothing. <b>Will</b> you <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me what has happened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Sabin will {{probably}} write to you," [...] Helène said. [...] "This house is taken for another fortnight, {{and you can}} of course remain here, if you choose. You <b>will</b> certainly <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him within {{the next day or}} two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{hope to see}} {{you again}} shortly, Duke," [...] Dominey said, as he {{completed}} his leave-taking. [...] "There is a little matter of business to be adjusted between us. You <b>will</b> probably <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Mr. Mangan in a day or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{had better}} go {{on board the}} Pinillo boat now," [...] he said. [...] "Our {{business}} is done, and it is well that you sail to-morrow. When we {{are ready for the}} next cargo, you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait. In a day--two days, perhaps--you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> your uncle. He {{will tell}} you how to send money to the lawless ones. You will follow his instructions, and he will come home with smiles and singing. I know. It is very regrettable, but it is so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} well enough," [...] Dick panted; [...] "but I {{did it on}} purpose. We will turn and work round again. They <b>will</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>from</b> the villagers, that we have come this way, and will be {{following}} us down the road while we are making {{our way back to}} the ghauts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --He {{knew what}} money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too. Do {{you know what}} is the pride of the English? Do {{you know what is}} the proudest word you <b>will</b> ever <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> an Englishman's mouth? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is that to}} you? I <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> nothing <b>from</b> {{you about}} Lady Kingsbury, unless {{you have to tell}} me of some claim to be made upon her. If there has been money promised you, and she {{acknowledges}} it, it shall be paid. Has there been any such promise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Duchess advanced, and, {{in a few}} words, {{in which}} there was as much {{kindness}} as civility, assured Jeanie of the respect which she had for a character so affectionate, and yet so firm, and added, [...] "When you get home, you <b>will</b> perhaps <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|N.B.--Having {{regard to}} the eccentricities of the Law of Libel it must be {{distinctly}} understood that the following does not refer to the distinguished officer, Lieut. Troup Horne, of the Inns of Court. Anybody trying to cause mischief between a civilian of eight stone and a soldier of seventeen by {{a statement to the}} contrary <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> my solicitors.|$|E
6000|$|... "I need no introduction," [...] the {{merchant}} said, smiling, [...] "for {{it is to}} their valour also that I owe it that you see me here alive. If yon can spare time to come and take your meal with me, which should be ready by this time, I will tell you about it, and <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> you also, how they have done you a like service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They live there." [...] Duval pointed {{with his}} thumb. [...] "They {{are not at}} home now. They go on a hunt. But you shall not make more trouble for them or you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> me," [...] and again he handled his gun suggestively. The man's face was very red and {{looked as if he}} had been drinking. Evidently he was in an ugly humor.|$|E
6000|$|... "A boyish enthusiasm," [...] {{he remarked}} contemptuously, {{as he made}} his way towards the door. [...] "Where the cleverest detectives in England have failed, you hope to succeed.

6000|$|... 'He {{that asks}} no {{questions}} <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> no lies <b>from</b> me. I am a stranger; and I am spent, and hungered. Can {{you let me}} lie with you to-night?' ...|$|R
60|$|Val. In conclusion, she {{consented to}} the interview; {{and for the}} rest, I urged it not, for I suppose she <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> reason sooner <b>from</b> your mouth than mine.|$|R
