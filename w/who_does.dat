40|$|Background: Numerous {{individual}} characteristics {{have been found}} to be associated with rates of ob-taining flu shots. This study creates a predictive model that assesses the relative impact of each of these factors on increasing rates of flu shots in a population. Methods: The Medicare beneficiary survey from 1998 and 1999 was used. Sixteen factors present in 1998 were compared between subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots. Significant factors were then used in a logistic regression to predict the probability of receiving a flu shot in 1998 and 1999. Results: Seven demographic and 7 health status measures were significantly different between sub-jects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots in 1998. Logistic regression showed that twelve of these variables were associated with a subject receiving a flu shot in 1998 and explained 11. 4 % of the vari-ability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. For the following year, 1999, 7 measures were significantly associated with receiving a flu shot and explained 64 % of the variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. One variable, if the subject had received a flu shot in 1998, was highly predic-tive of a subject receiving a flu shot in 1999, explaining 63 % of the observed variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot in 1999...|$|R

The performance of standard clinical reconstruction procedures in discrimination tasks re-lated to the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was compared with the performance of a quantitative approach incorporating improved corrections for scatter, attenuation, in-trinsic spatial resolution, and distance-dependent spatial reso-lution. Methods: Seventeen normal controls (normal group), 56 subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not have dementia, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> have memory problems, but <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not develop AD within 5 y of follow-up (questionable group), and 27 subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not have demen-tia, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> have memory problems, and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> develop AD over the follow-up period (converter group) were considered in this study. 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime SPECT and MRI studies were performed for each subject at baseline.

5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not injure others with words, thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E

30|$|We {{find that}} only 26 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive {{accommodations}} at their current or most recent job are currently employed compared to 37 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive accommodations. Furthermore, those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive accommodations are more {{likely to be}} in poor health and have a physical disability compared to those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive accommodations. Finally, 3.2 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive workplace accommodations have had their disability since birth compared to 5.2 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive accommodations. This is also reflected in the fewer number of years since onset for those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive accommodations compared to those <b>who</b> <b>do.</b> We also examine whether individual characteristics vary based on the type of workplace accommodation received (Appendix Table  7). There is some slight variation; for example, those who have a flexible schedule {{are more likely to have}} a bachelor’s degree or higher than those who receive help with transportation, have a personal care attendant or personal assistant, or receive help with child or family care. These latter groups are not only more likely to have less than a high school degree but also more likely to perceive themselves as being in excellent health.|$|R

MethodsChi-square analysis of weighted data to compare demographic and behavioral data of persons interviewed who provided specimens for anonymous testing with those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not. Prevalence estimation to determine the impact if persons not providing specimens had higher prevalence rates than those <b>who</b> <b>did.</b> ResultsComparing those <b>who</b> provided specimens with those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not, {{there was no significant}} difference by age, residence, education, marital status, perceived risk, sexual experience or number of sex partners for women. A significant difference by sexual experience was found for men. Prevalence estimates did not change substantially when prevalence was assumed to be two times higher for persons not providing specimens. ConclusionWhen comparing persons who provided specimens for HIV testing with those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not, few significant differences were found. If those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not provide specimens had prevalence rates twice that of those <b>who</b> <b>did,</b> overall prevalence would not be substantially affected.
