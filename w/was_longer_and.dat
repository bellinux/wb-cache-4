5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it <b>was</b> <b>longer,</b> <b>and</b> consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the year}} after the war ended, around 60,000 British {{tourists}} and mourners made pilgrimages to the Western Front. The transatlantic voyage <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> more expensive from Canada; many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed, and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small, unofficial groups. The delegates of the 1928 national convention of the Canadian Legion passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to the Western Front battlefields. A plan began to take form wherein the Legion aimed to coordinate the pilgrimage with the unveiling of the Vimy memorial, which at the time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932. Due to construction delays with the memorial, it was not until July 1934 that the Canadian Legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with the unveiling of the memorial. Although the exact date of the memorial unveiling was still not set, the Legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in Ottawa. The response from veterans and their families was enthusiastic—1,200 inquiries by November 1934. The Legion presumptuously announced that the memorial would be unveiled on Dominion Day, 1 July 1936, even though the government still did not know when it would be completed.|$|E

25|$|Leptictidium is {{a special}} animal {{because of the way}} its anatomy {{combines}} quite primitive elements with elements which prove a high degree of specialization. It had small fore legs and large hind legs, especially at the distal side (that further from the body). The lateral phalanges of its forelegs (fingers I and V) were very short and weak, finger III <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> fingers II and IV were roughly equal in size, and slightly shorter than finger III. The tips of the phalanges were elongated and tapered.|$|E
25|$|Many of Andes cruises {{were to the}} Caribbean (typically {{in spring}} and autumn), the Mediterranean or the Baltic. Most of them lasted from 16 to 26 days. Her {{calendar}} always included a Christmas and New Year cruise, typically to islands in the Atlantic and perhaps the North African coast. That was followed each year by a Winter Cruise, which <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> could be up to two months. The length of the Winter Cruise allowed to Andes to sail farther from her home port of Southampton, to any ocean that was exotic and warm while the Northern Hemisphere was in winter.|$|E

Unique colours were issued to the Navy, to YPA reserve units and the Territorial Defense Forces of the republics.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} primary routes from Seattle to the Yukon gold fields. One was by ship to the {{south-east}} Alaskan towns of Dyea and Skagway, and then via land for 30 miles over high mountain passes {{from where the}} miners could travel down the tributaries of the Yukon River. The other route <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> more costly but faster and less grueling: Miners would take a coastal steamer to the Yukon delta port of St. Michael, from where they could transfer to a river steamer to head up the Yukon River. The Roanoke was brought to Seattle specifically by the North American Transportation and Trading Company to serve the long coastal route to St. Michael, sometime calling at intermediate ports such as Dutch Harbor. The NATTC began advertising the Roanokes service in March 1898.|$|E
25|$|The {{skull of}} E. annectens {{is known for}} its long, wide muzzle. Cope {{compared}} this feature to that of a goose in side view, and to a short-billed spoonbill in top view. The skull <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> lower proportionally than in any other known hadrosaurid. The toothless portion of the anterior mandible was relatively longer than in any hadrosaur. The extreme length and breadth did not appear until an individual reached maturity, so many specimens lack the distinctive shape. The bones surrounding the large openings for the nostrils formed deep pockets around the openings. The eye sockets were rectangular and longer front to back than top to bottom, although this may have been exaggerated by postmortem crushing. The skull roof was flat and lacked a bony crest, and the quadrate bone that formed the articulation with the lower jaw was distinctly curved. The lower jaw was long and straight, lacking the downward curve seen in other hadrosaurids, and possessing a heavy ridge running its length. The predentary was wide and shovel-like. The ridge on the lower jaw may have reinforced the long, slender structure.|$|E

25|$|Both Arcades and A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634 were masques {{commissioned}} by the family of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater through the influence of Lawes, the Earl's music tutor for his children. Arcades was written to honour Alice Spencer, Countess Dowager of Derby, and performed on her estate at Harefield west of London; the date is debated, perhaps in October 1632 as the family tried to put behind it the scandal of the execution of her son-in-law Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven for sexual offences, or on her 75th birthday, 4 May 1634. A Mask was performed for Michaelmas eve, 29 September 1634, at Ludlow Castle, the Earl of Bridgewater's residence. This masque differed in some ways from other masques of the time, in that it <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> did not rely as much on music. The text was revised and published in 1638. Milton was a theatre-goer in his youth, as he mentions in Elegy I, and his dramatic work on masques, though the genre was closely associated with court entertainments, {{has been seen as}} suggestive of a reforming rather than a negative attitude to drama, in contrast to militant critics such as William Prynne from the Puritan side.|$|E
25|$|The slim {{power unit}} {{encouraged}} {{the design of}} slender, well-streamlined fuselages, and {{the nose of the}} Nautilus <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> more pointed than even that of the Ripon III, which used a larger area W-12 Napier Lion engine. The wooden propeller was two-bladed with a diameter of 11ft (3.35m). Like most of Blackburn's aircraft of the time, the fuselage was built up around four steel longerons; it was duralumin-covered from the nose to just aft of the rear observer/gunner's cockpit, the rest fabric-covered. The pilot's cockpit was immediately in front of the observer's, under an upper trailing edge cutout. A braced, rather rectangular tailplane was carried {{at the top of the}} fuselage. There was fixed fin surface both above and below the fuselage and the rudder with its horn balance had an upper fin and extended down to the lower part. Both the tailplane incidence and (more unusually) the alignment of the upper part of the fin could be adjusted in flight via trimming wheels. The robust undercarriage was a broad, split-axle type with mainwheels fitted with disc brakes. As a seaplane, it could be fitted either with a two-float arrangement or with a single central float, the latter intended to give a better field of view to the observer.|$|E
25|$|The battle royal saw Atlantis and Negro Casas as {{the last}} to wrestlers in the ring, meaning that they would face off {{in the last of}} the four first round matches that {{immediately}} followed the Battle Royal. The first round matches were all quick, under or around four minutes per match. In the first round Máscara Dorada defeated Black Warrior, El Terrible defeated Mr. Águila, Rush defeated Rey Bucanero and in the final first round match Atlantis defeated Negro Casas. The second round matches were a bit longer, but still relatively short compared to non-tournament matches. In the second round El Terrible defeated Máscara Dorada and Rush defeated Atlantis, which meant that the long time rivals El Terrible and Rush would meet in the semi-final match. The semi-finals match <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> also more intense as the long-standing rivalry made both men work extra hard to gain the upper hand. El Terrible took the victory and the spot in the final and then made a challenge to Rush to put his hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas ("Bet Match") against El Terrible. Rush accepted the challenge and was subsequently attacked by El Terrible's team mate Rey Bucanero, who hit Rush over the head with a steel folding chair. Following the attack Rush, emphasizing the effects of the attack, was taken out of the arena on a stretch.|$|E

500|$|In the 1800s racers used a single, wooden pole, which <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> {{stronger}} than modern poles, {{and could be}} used for braking downhill, as well. In Norway, racing with two poles ("Finland style") met with resistance, starting in the 1880s, when some race rules forbade them; objections included issues of aesthetics—how they made skiers [...] " [...] like geese". [...] As the use of pairs of pole became the norm, materials favored lightness and strength, starting with bamboo, which gave way to fiberglass, used at the 1968 Winter Olympics, aluminum, used at the 1972 Winter Olympics, and ultimately carbon fiber, introduced in 1975.|$|E
500|$|The first Europeans {{to observe}} it were French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley, in the 1630s. The name [...] "lacrosse" [...] comes from their reports, which {{described}} the players' sticks as like a bishop's crosier—la crosse in French. The Native American tribes used various names: in the Onondaga language {{it was called}} dehuntshigwa'es ("they bump hips" [...] or [...] "men hit a rounded object"); da-nah-wah'uwsdi ("little war") to the Eastern Cherokee; in Mohawk, tewaarathon ("little brother of war"); and baggataway in Ojibwe. Variations in the game were {{not limited to the}} name. [...] In the Great Lakes region, players used an entirely wooden stick, while the Iroquois stick <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> was laced with string, and the Southeastern tribes played with two shorter sticks, one in each hand.|$|E
500|$|Ski poles {{are used}} for balance and propulsion. Modern {{cross-country}} ski poles are made from aluminium, fibreglass-reinforced plastic, or carbon fibre, depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly {{they were made of}} wood or bamboo. [...] They feature a foot (called a basket) {{near the end of the}} shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing. Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a single pole for both cross-country and downhill. The single pole <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> stronger than the poles that are used in pairs. In competitive cross-country poles in pairs were introduced around 1900.|$|E

500|$|The unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls {{meant that}} iron was only adopted as a {{building}} material for battleships when protected by armor. However, iron gave the naval architect many advantages. Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design, for instance {{the use of}} watertight bulkheads on the lower decks. Warrior, built of iron, <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> faster than the wooden-hulled Gloire. [...] Iron could be produced to order and used immediately, {{in contrast to the}} need to give wood a long period of seasoning. And, given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron, iron hulls were increasingly cost-effective. The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough, and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden-hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought.|$|E
500|$|...

500|$|The {{struggle}} against the uprising of the Zanj slaves in the marshlands of southern Iraq—according to Michael Bonner [...] "the greatest slave rebellion {{in the history of}} Islam"—which began in September 869, <b>was</b> <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> more difficult, and almost brought the Caliphate to is knees. Due to the Saffarid threat, the Abbasids could not mobilize against the Zanj until 879. Consequently, the Zanj initially held the upper hand, capturing much of lower Iraq including Basra and Wasit and defeating the Abbasid armies, which were reduced to trying to contain the Zanj advance. The balance tipped after 879, when al-Muwaffaq's son Abu'l-Abbas, the future Caliph al-Mu'tadid (r. 892–902), was given the command. Abu'l-Abbas was joined in 880 by al-Muwaffaq himself, and in a succession of engagements in the marshes of southern Iraq, the Abbasid forces drove back the Zanj towards their capital, Mukhtara, which fell in August 883. Another son of al-Muwaffaq, Harun, also participated in the campaigns. He also served as nominal governor of a few provinces, but died young on 7 November 883. The victory over the Zanj was celebrated as a major triumph for al-Muwaffaq personally and for his regime: al-Muwaffaq received the victory title al-Nasir li-din Allah, [...] "He who upholds the Faith of God", while his secretary Sa'id ibn Makhlad received the title Dhu'l-Wizaratayn, [...] "Holder of the two vizierates".|$|E
