5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared <b>with</b> <b>living</b> carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E

On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E

Although HIV transmission among persons with disabilities in Africa is increasingly acknowledged, {{there is a need}} to bring to life the experiences and voices from persons <b>with</b> disabilities <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV to raise awareness of programme implementers and policy makers about their barriers in accessing HIV services. This paper explores how the barriers faced by persons <b>with</b> disabilities <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV impede their ability to access HIV-related services and manage their disease. Methods: We conducted focus group discussions with 76 persons (41 females; 35 males) with physical, visual and/or hearing impairments who were <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV in Ghana, Uganda and Zambia (2012 – 2013). We explored challenges and facilitators at different levels (individual, psychosocial and structural) of access to HIV services. Transcripts were analyzed using a framework analysis approach. Results: Persons <b>with</b> disabilities <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV encountered a wide variety of challenges in accessing HIV services. Delays in testing for HIV were common, with most waiting until they were sick to be tested. Reasons for delayed testing included challenges in getting to the health facilities, lack of information about HIV and testing, and HIV- and disability-related stigma. Barriers to HIV-related services, including care and treatment, at health facilities included lack of disability-friendly educational materials and sign interpreters, stigmatizing treatment by providers and other patients, lack of skills to provide tailored services to persons <b>with</b> disabilities <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV and physically inaccessible infrastructure, all of which make it extremely difficult for persons with disabilities to initiate and adhere to HIV treatment. Accessibility challenges were greater for women than men due to gender-related roles. Challenges were similar across the three countries. Favourable {{experiences in}} accessing HIV services were reported in Uganda and Zambia, where disability-tailored services were offered by non-governmental organizations and government facilities (Uganda only). Conclusions: Persons <b>with</b> disabilities <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV encounter many challenges in accessing HIV testing and continued care and treatment services.

It often means a {{permanent}} fight against stigma and a daily {{struggle to make}} ends meet.

Through the researcher‟s interactions <b>with</b> individuals <b>living</b> <b>with</b> chronic mental illness, {{it became clear that}} they are not adequately supported by relatives {{and other members of the}} communities in which they live. Sometimes they are deprived access to basic needs namely, shelter, medications, freedom of movement and of expression. There is an exaggerated fear of, as well as a negative attitude towards those <b>living</b> <b>with</b> mental illness. In the Northwest Health Directorate of Namibia, there are no community care facilities for individuals <b>living</b> <b>with</b> chronic mental illness. There are no alternative community aftercare modes for discharged individuals <b>living</b> <b>with</b> chronic mental illness. Post-discharge of the patient from the hospital, there are no follow-ups regarding the social circumstances they find themselves in. As a result, the home-care for someone <b>living</b> <b>with</b> chronic mental illness after hospitalization remains the sole responsibility of the relatives who rarely know how to look after the patient. On many occasions the public has been very ignorant about mental illness, resulting in them having a very negative attitude towards persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> chronic mental illness.
