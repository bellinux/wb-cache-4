25|$|Because f(η) is real valued, {{the three}} roots η1, η2 and η3 are either all three real, or {{otherwise}} one {{is real and}} the remaining two are a pair of complex conjugates. In the latter case, with only one real-valued root, {{there is only one}} elevation η at which f(η) is zero. And consequently also only one elevation at which the surface slope η’ is zero. However, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> wave like solutions, with two elevations—the wave crest and trough (physics)—where the surface slope is zero. The conclusion is that all three roots of f(η) have to be real valued.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's {{performance}} {{was greeted with}} applause from both sets of supporters as Phil Thompson led his team up to the Royal Box to receive the Charity Shield. Paisley was delighted with the manner of his team's win and quipped, [...] "I am just sorry we didn't get two points for it!" [...] He praised the Wembley surface and said of McDermott's first goal [...] " [...] captured what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> – the run, the control and the finish were perfect." [...] Arsenal manager Terry Neill described the match as a [...] "great advertisement for football" [...] and felt his side contributed greatly in periods. Of his opponents, he said: [...] "Liverpool are a smashing side and I don't expect to meet anyone better this season." [...] Indeed, Liverpool went on to retain the First Division title, withstanding pressure from Manchester United and ending their league campaign on 60 points. Arsenal finished three places behind in fourth, and reached the finals of the FA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, only to end the season empty-handed.|$|E

[...] It was also noted that models applying to be in the video should have an Abercrombie & Fitch style about them, and that [...] "small tattoos" [...] were acceptable. For the most part of the video, Lewis is featured on a beach in a variety of different settings, such as sitting in an old cabriolet car, in which she is surrounded by her friends. Sitting in the car, Lewis wears a polka dot bikini top. Other scenes include Lewis standing in the shallow part of the ocean by herself, as well as sitting around a fire on the beach. As the video progresses, it changes from daytime to nighttime. Ryan Love of Digital Spy praised the video, saying [...] " [...] sees Lewis show off a new look while chilling with friends throughout the day and into the night."

[...] After four mobisodes aired, he remarked that [...] "these vignettes feel like your average deleted scene—removed {{for a good}} reason"; however, no mobisode received a score less than 6.5. [...] "The Watch" [...] scored a 7.5 and was called [...] "touching" [...] because Jack and his father have rarely been seen getting along in Lost. [...] "The Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt" [...] was given a 6.5 and described as [...] "a funny little moment" [...] and [...] "tragic", in regard to Libby's death. [...] "King of the Castle" [...] received an 8.5. [...] Carabott {{said that it was}} well written, [...] "a great performance from [...] " [...] and worthy of appearing on television. [...] Carabott celebrated Michael's return in [...] "The Deal", but the reviewer noted that [...] "The Deal" [...] "doesn't reveal anything new or exciting at all". [...] "Operation: Sleeper" [...] was rated as a 7.5, as was [...] "Buried Secrets". [...] "Room 23" [...] got an 8 and was described as [...] "definitely the type of new content that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> [...] It's something that won't be missed by regular viewers but gives a little more insight into the nature of events on the island". [...] "Arzt and Crafts" [...] also got an 8 and was said to have [...] "a cleverly devised title" [...] and was [...] "packed with a healthy amount of humor". [...] "Tropical Depression" [...] received an 8.5, with Carabott calling it [...] "rather pointless ... but cute nonetheless". [...] "Jack, Meet Ethan. [...] Ethan? [...] Jack" [...] scored an 8 and Mapother's acting skills were commended. [...] "Jin Has a Temper-Tantrum on the Golf Course" [...] was deemed [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "one of [...] funniest ... moments" [...] and worthy of a 7.5. [...] "The Envelope" [...] was given a 6.5, and [...] "So It Begins" [...] was given a 9—the highest score of any mobisode—and was described as [...] "a shocking new look at the Christian Shephard who appeared to Jack".|$|E
