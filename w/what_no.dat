5|$|Prince Norodom Sihanouk {{had ruled}} Cambodia adeptly {{since he had}} wrested {{independence}} from the French on 9 November 1953. He had accomplished this task by deft political maneuvering between {{both the left and}} the right to achieve <b>what</b> <b>no</b> other ruler or political group in Indochina had managed, a relatively bloodless transition to independence. During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance while at the same time maintaining his nation's neutrality (guaranteed by the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the First Indochina War).|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{monument}} (1731) {{can be seen}} in Westminster Abbey, at {{the north}} of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. The Latin inscription on the base translates as:Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, <b>what</b> <b>no</b> other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25 December 1642, and died on 20 March 1726/7.—Translation from G.L. Smyth, The Monuments and Genii of St. Paul's Cathedral, and of Westminster Abbey (1826), ii, 703–4.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; <b>what</b> <b>no</b> one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

25|$|According to biographer Juhani Suomi, Kekkonen gave {{no thought}} to resigning until his {{physical}} condition began to deteriorate in July 1981. The 80-year-old president {{then began to}} seriously consider resigning, most likely in early 1982. Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto finally dealt a defeat to Kekkonen in 1981. In April, Koivisto did <b>what</b> <b>no</b> one else had dared to during Kekkonen's presidency by stating that under the constitution, {{the prime minister and}} cabinet were responsible to Parliament, not to the President. He then refused to resign at Kekkonen's request. This is generally seen as the death-knell of the Kekkonen era.|$|E

In 2008 Jim Strickland accomplished <b>what</b> <b>no</b> other previous band president had achieved, he convinced music director Charlie Tagawa to make a professional recording of several of his virtuoso performances. That Charlie Sound is the result and is the only professionally produced recording capturing Tagawa's skill as a soloist.|$|E

500|$|In 982, Adud al-Dawla sent another {{envoy to}} Constantinople, this time under Abu Ishaq ibn Shahram, who after having spent {{three months in}} the city, {{concluded}} a 10-year peace treaty with them.

Stein notes that the apologists define the Waffen-SS [...] "in the narrowest of terms" [...] and are silent on the matter of war crimes. He notes that only a minority of men were implicated in known atrocities and that the most historically significant role of the Waffen-SS was in the battles for [...] "Hitler's Europe". But [...] "to recognise this is not to agree with the apologists who picture {{the overwhelming majority of the}} men of the Waffen-SS as idealistic, clean-living, decent and honourable soldiers", Stein writes.|$|E
