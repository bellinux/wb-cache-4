2500|$|Wladyslawa Choms, [...] "The Angel of Lvov", headed Zegota in Lvov, {{helped by}} the Church and the Home Army. She {{described}} the Catholic clergy as [...] "invaluable" [...] to the effort, for they supplied blank baptismal certificates from which to create false documents. Wladyslaw Bartoszewski (aka [...] "Teofil"), a co-founder of Zegota, had worked with the Catholic underground movement, the Front for the Rebirth of Poland, and was arrested in a 1940 Nazi purge of the intelligentsia, and sent to Auchwitz. Freed seven months later following pressure from the international Red Cross, Bartoszewski helped Zegota in its rescue efforts. Explaining his motivation, he later said: [...] "I was raised a Catholic and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> to love our neighbour. I was doing what the Bible taught." [...] He was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations in 1963. As head of Zegota's children's section, Irena Sendlerowa placed more that two thousands five hundred Jewish children in convents, orphanages, schools, hospitals and homes. She was captured by the Gestapo in 1943, and crippled by torture.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] {{provided}} feminists {{the tools}} {{on how to}} interpret literature in different ways. Lanser says the short story was a [...] "particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision [...] [...] [...] because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall". The narrator in the story {{is trying to find}} a single meaning in the wallpaper. [...] At first she focuses on contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is [...] "flamboyant" [...] while also [...] "dull", [...] "pronounced" [...] yet also [...] "lame" [...] and [...] "uncertain" [...] (p.13). [...] She takes into account the patterns and tries to geometrically organize them, but she is further confused. [...] The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor which Jane cannot recognize (p.25). At night the narrator is able to see a woman behind bars within the complicated design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that Jane was able to find [...] "a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection". Lanser creates a relationship between the narrator and the reader. Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find one single meaning. [...] "How <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> to read" [...] as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text. The patriarchal ideology has kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper." [...] Thanks to feminist criticism, [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] has become a fundamental reading in the standard curriculum. Feminists have made a great contribution to the study of literature but, according to Lanser, are falling short because [...] "we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked.|$|E

60|$|Within, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> as {{the chief}} {{subjects}} of instruction, Latin and Greek. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> very badly because the men who taught us did not habitually use either of these languages, nobody uses them any more now except perhaps for the Latin of a few Levantine monasteries. At the utmost our men read them. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> these languages because long ago Latin had been the language of civilisation; the one way of escape from the narrow and localised life had lain in those days through Latin, and afterwards Greek had come in as the vehicle of a flood of new and amazing ideas. Once these two languages had been the sole means of initiation to the detached criticism and partial comprehension of the world. I can imagine the fierce zeal of our first Heads, Gardener and Roper, teaching Greek like passionate missionaries, as a progressive Chinaman might teach English to the boys of Pekin, clumsily, impatiently, with rod and harsh urgency, but sincerely, patriotically, because they felt that behind it lay revelations, the irresistible stimulus to a new phase of history. That was long ago. A new great world, a vaster Imperialism had arisen about the school, had assimilated all these amazing and incredible ideas, {{had gone on to}} new and yet more amazing developments of its own. But the City Merchants School still made the substance of its teaching Latin and Greek, still, with no thought of rotating crops, sowed in a dream amidst the harvesting.|$|E
