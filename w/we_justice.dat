5000|$|In an April 13, 1997, {{interview}} on NBC's Meet the Press, Tim Russert asked Farrakhan {{to explain the}} Nation of Islam's view on separation: Tim Russert: [...] "Once a week, on the back page your newspaper is The Muslim Program, 'What the Muslims Want' in 1965. The first {{is in terms of}} territory, 'Since we cannot get along with them in peace and equality, we believe our contributions to this land and the suffering forced upon us by white America justifies our demand for complete separation in a state or territory of our own.' Is that your view in 1997, a separate state for Black Americans?" [...] Minister Louis Farrakhan: [...] "First, the program starts with number one. That is number four. The first part of that program is that we want freedom, a full and complete freedom. The second is, <b>we</b> want <b>justice.</b> <b>We</b> want equal <b>justice</b> under the law, and <b>we</b> want <b>justice</b> applied equally to all, regardless of race or class or color. And the third is that we want equality. We want equal membership in society with the best in civilized society. If we can get that within the political, economic, social system of America, there's no need for point number four. But if we cannot get along in peace after giving America 400 years of our service and sweat and labor, then, of course, separation would be the solution to our race problem." ...|$|R

Since the latter type of disagreement is pervasive in real-world politics, the conclusion is that theories of justice designed for our world should be centrally concerned with democracy...|$|R

40|$|Addressing the United Nations Security Council, Australian foreign {{minister}} Julie Bishop condemned the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH 17 as “barbaric” and “an absolute outrage”. She demanded <b>justice,</b> saying: <b>We</b> must have <b>justice.</b> <b>We</b> {{owe it to}} the victims and their families to determine what happened and who was responsible. When 298 innocent civilians are killed in such tragic circumstances what exactly do we mean when <b>we</b> call for <b>justice?</b> What are the chances of justice being done in this case? Can international law realistically deliver a measure of justice that will provide any level of comfort or closure to the grieving families and friends? Ordinarily, calls for justice rely on demands to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible. This is reflected in the resolution that the Security Council adopted. It emphasised the importance of a “full, thorough and independent international investigation” and demanded that those responsible be held to account. Unfortunately, both history and recent events suggest that justice under international law is elusive and difficult to deliver. Several avenues may be pursued. None is swift or straightforward...|$|R
40|$|In truth, I am as distressed as the Court is,” Justice Antonin Scalia {{wrote in}} his dissent in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.

Social movements may protest long and loud for recognition of their constitutional claims, but judges are not supposed to heed them. Rather, they are supposed to follow the law, as best they can determine what the law is. As Chief Justice Rehnquist once explained, although judges are clearly as influenced by public opinion as anyone else living in the world, they are not supposed directly to respond to the claims of social movements...|$|R
