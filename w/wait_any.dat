There a certain cannibal rakshasa named Hidimbasura lives with his sister Hidimbi. He smells the scent of human beings and orders his sister to bring them. Hidimbi however falls in love at first sight with Bheema. Unable to <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer, Hidimbasura comes to kill the Pandavas himself. Bheema however kills him very easily. Hidimbi is married to Bheema. She later gives birth to Ghatotkacha from this union.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50 {{the brigade}} started landing at DZ-N, {{just north of}} Ranville. Equipment and navigational {{failures}} by the RAF pilots and the division's pathfinders resulted in the brigade being {{scattered all over the}} countryside. By 02:40 only around 40 per cent of the 7th Parachute Battalion had reached their assembly point. Unable to <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer, the battalion headed for the captured bridges, and established a defensive position in Benouville, the division's only position west of the Caen Canal. Most of the 12th Parachute Battalion landed on {{the eastern edge of the}} DZ, and only around 60 per cent of the battalion arrived at their assembly point. Their objective was to secure the village of Le Bas de Ranville, which was achieved by 04:00. The 13th Parachute Battalion could also only muster around 60 per cent of its strength on the DZ. This battalion had two objectives; to secure Ranville and to clear the DZ of obstacles for the division's gliders which were to land next.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that {{she did not want to}} <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Charter {{requires}} that an athlete {{be a national}} {{of the country for}} which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{thereafter}} McGovern {{was sworn}} in as a private at Fort Snelling in Minnesota. He spent a month at Jefferson Barracks Military Post in Missouri and then five months at Southern Illinois Normal University in Carbondale, Illinois, for ground school training; McGovern later maintained that both the academic work and physical training were the toughest he ever experienced. He spent two months at a base in San Antonio, Texas, and then went to Hatbox Field in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for basic flying school, training in a single-engined PT‑19. McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943 during a three-day leave (lonely and in love, the couple had decided to not <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer); his father presided over the ceremony at the small Methodist church in Woonsocket. After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to Coffeyville Army Airfield in Kansas for a further three months of training on the BT‑13. Around April 1944, McGovern went on to advanced flying school at Pampa Army Airfield in Texas for twin-engine training on the AT‑17 and AT‑9. Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good depth perception aiding him. Eleanor McGovern followed him to these different duty stations, and was present when he received his wings and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Canadian Battalion {{successfully}} {{destroyed the}} bridges at Varaville and Robehomme after {{landing on the}} northern DZ. They then withdrew to defend Le Mesnil, where the brigade headquarters and the field ambulance were located. Meanwhile, by 02:50 only 150 men of the 9th Parachute Battalion had gathered at their assembly area, with virtually no heavy weapons or supplies. Unable to <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer, they headed for the Merville Gun Battery. The battalion captured the battery, but without explosives, could only damage two of its four guns. The battle had been costly, and only 85 men were left to head for their secondary objective, the village of Le Plein. The village was defended in strength by the Germans, and the weakened battalion could only dig in and wait the arrival of commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade later that day. By nightfall the brigade was deployed facing east, along the ridge of high ground from Le Plein in the north to the Bois de Bavent in the south.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} demon Nadja, Aleph travels through the underground, finding a brainwashed Hiroko in a {{concentration}} camp. Her cell is guarded by Zayin, who admits to having {{doubts about the}} Center's action and lets Aleph free Hiroko; she refuses to leave, but Nadja frees her from the brainwashing by fusing with her. On their way back, Aleph and Hiroko learn that the Center has released the demon Abaddon to swallow the entire Valhalla district, and that the Center only plans to let those they deem worthy be allowed {{to live in the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom; everyone else would be abandoned and left to die. Zayin starts a revolt against the Center, who threatens to cut off the air supply to the Holytown district if he does not surrender; he, Aleph and Hiroko go to the Center to confront the four elders leading it. Aleph and Hiroko learn that the elders are actually the archangels Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel; Aleph and Hiroko fight and kill the first three archangels, after which Gabriel reveals that YHVH, the creator god, had ordered the archangels to watch over the creation of Tokyo Millennium and wait for the Messiah, but that Michael, Raphael and Uriel, unable to <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer, created Aleph as an artificial, false Messiah, leading YHVH to abandon them; he was the boy Hiroko was searching for, aged unnaturally fast to take on the role of Messiah. Similarly, Beth was artificially created as the Messiah's partner, Zayin as his bodyguard, Daleth as a false savior intended to be defeated by the Messiah so that Aleph would win the people's favor, and Gimmel as a trial Messiah for the Arcadia prototype.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E

25|$|In 1190 Emperor Henry VI, had revoked Hartwig's princely regalia {{empowering}} {{his rule}} in the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen for his partisanship with the House of Welf. The Pope, however, did not depose Hartwig as archbishop, who fled first with the Guelphs to England and then to Lüneburg. In 1192 Duke Valdemar, meanwhile 22 years old, seriously disagreed about Bishop Valdemar's way of leading the diocese. In the same year the Bremian Chapter didn't <b>wait</b> <b>any</b> longer for a papal dismissal of Hartwig and unauthorisedly elected Valdemar as its new Prince-Archbishop - encouraged by HenryVI. Valdemar welcomed his election, hoping his new position could be helpful in his dispute with Duke Valdemar and his elder brother Canute VI. Before entering the Prince-Archbishopric he won the support of Ditmarsh. Moreover, the bishop conspired with AdolphusIII of Holstein, perhaps also with his brothers-in-law JaromarI of Rugia and CasimirII of Pomerania, and with Canute I of Sweden and Sverre of Norway. The Bremian mint {{in the city of}} Bremen issued coins showing Valdemar's portrait.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Thunder" [...] is a ballad {{about finding}} the [...] "strength of rising after the fall" [...] and follows the self-empowerment {{theme of the}} album.
