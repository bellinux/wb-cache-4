5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in blowing up railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted <b>with</b> <b>shock</b> that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim.

They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway. He was in Troms at the time of the German capitulation.|$|E
5|$|Though many {{remained}} unimpressed, Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer {{the head}} of a new group to test implosion. His group became the E-5 (Implosion) Group, which was part of Captain William S. Parsons' E Division. A gun-type nuclear weapon was the preferred method, but implosion research constituted a backup. Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions. The result was a series of distorted shapes. Progress was made; Neddermeyer and a member of his team, Hugh Bradner, along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission, conceived the idea of explosive lenses, in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion. Nevertheless, seemingly unsolvable problems <b>with</b> <b>shock</b> wave uniformity brought progress on implosion to a crawl.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react <b>with</b> <b>shock</b> and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E

40|$|The work {{performed}} {{as part of}} this grant may be described in the context of developing numerical methods for solving an abstract, nonlinear variational problem for which the straightforward Galerkin approximation on a space of reasonable dimension is inaccurate.

We have developed new formulations for this model term especially for turbulent flows and for systems <b>with</b> <b>shocks.</b> We have also developed a dynamic approach for evaluating the parameters that appear in this model term.

40|$|Narrowed {{arteriovenous}} oxygen difference (AVD) {{associated with}} normal or elevated cardiac index(CI), hyperlacticacidemia, and decreased oxygen consumption (V 02) occurs in many patients <b>with</b> septic <b>shock.</b> These findings suggests peripheral defect in V 02.

Narrowed AVD with normal or elevated CI occurred in 11 of 20 patients studied. AVD correlated inversely with CI. In the dog given E. coli endotoxin, there was marked widening of the AVD and decrease in cardiac output. In patients <b>with</b> septic <b>shock</b> and dogs <b>with</b> endotoxic <b>shock,</b> arterial bleed lactate correlated inversely with V 02 but did not correlate with pC 02. In 5 patients with hypoxemia and septic shock, oxygen therapy did not improve V 02. These findings in patients <b>with</b> septic <b>shock</b> imply cellular damage or arteriovenous shunting.
