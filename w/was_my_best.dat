In 1988, Masters hired him away from Falcon. The first film Travis helmed under Masters' supervision <b>was</b> <b>My</b> <b>Best</b> Buddy (1988).|$|E

She was {{incredibly}} smart, funny and talented, {{a bright light}} with an infectious laugh and huge smile that radiated inner and outer beauty... she <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> friend, and the person with whom I was supposed to grow old".|$|E
2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> friend. Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and I used to go to trials all the time as children. We went to the trials instead of going to the movies." [...] After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Noisey in March 2013, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would break up again, explaining {{that he did not}} want to carry on without Scaccia. He explained, [...] "Mikey <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> friend in the world and there's no Ministry without him. But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. So yes, this will be Ministry's last album." [...] The album, titled From Beer to Eternity, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen stated that Ministry would tour in support of From Beer to Eternity, but would not record any more albums. In an April 2016 interview with Loudwire, however, Jourgensen mentioned the possibility of making another Ministry album [...] "if the circumstances are right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson stated [...] "Of course {{everyone}} wants to sell records and be number one. And I think that's important. But {{for a lot of}} artists today, it's all about the money as opposed to the art. What happened to artists creating this wonderful body of music that touches people and changes their lives?" [...] In response to boycotted promotion, Jackson stated [...] "A lot of people said they didn't even know the project was out, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with the response. Yet a lot of fans in Europe came up to me saying they absolutely felt it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> album. There were all kinds of reactions to the album, and there was obviously a lot of drama surrounding that album as well." [...] Productions deadlines also caused Jackson to rush, saying [...] "Deadlines are hard for me; I don't like being forced to do things when you know you're not ready; when you're on the right path but you know you haven't gotten to the place you want to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the , Button scored {{his fourth}} pole {{position}} {{of the season with}} his final lap of qualifying, commenting afterwards, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> lap of the weekend and definitely one of the best laps I've ever done." [...] Button then managed his tyres much better than his teammate {{in the early stages of}} the race, building a lead which he did not relinquish, and making it a hat-trick of victories. David Tremayne described it as [...] "as good a performance as anything we had seen there from the likes of Ayrton Senna or Michael Schumacher", adding that it [...] "swept away final doubts about his ability after years of floundering in mediocre machinery". In Turkey, Button qualified second behind Vettel but a first-lap error from the German allowed him to take the lead and he held off the competition to take his fourth consecutive win. This meant he had won six out of season's first seven races; an achievement matched only by Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark and Michael Schumacher, who all went on to win the world title.|$|E

2500|$|The Last Detail was {{nominated}} for the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival and Nicholson was awarded Best Actor. It was also nominated for three Academy Awards – Jack Nicholson for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Randy Quaid for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and Robert Towne for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium with none of them winning. In addition, The Last Detail {{was nominated}} for two Golden Globes Awards – Nicholson for Best Motion Picture Actor – Drama and Quaid for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. Nicholson did win a BAFTA award {{for his role in}} the film. Nicholson won the Best Actor awards from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle. However, he was disappointed that he failed to win an Oscar for his performance. [...] "I like the idea of winning at Cannes with The Last Detail, but not getting our own Academy Award hurt real bad. I did it in that movie, that <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> role".|$|E
2500|$|After being {{admitted}} to the bar, Dershowitz served as a clerk for David L. Bazelon, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He said that [...] "Bazelon <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> and worst boss at once ... He worked me to the bone; he didn't hesitate to call at 2a.m. He taught me everything—how to be a civil libertarian, a Jewish activist, a mensch. He was halfway between a slave master and a father figure." [...] During the 1963–1964 term, he served as law clerk for the Supreme Court Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg. He told Tom Van Riper of Forbes that getting a Supreme Court clerkship was probably his second big break; his first was when, at age 14 or 15, a camp counselor {{told him he was}} smart but that his mind operated a little differently. He joined the faculty of Harvard Law School as an assistant professor in 1964, and was made a full professor in 1967 at the age of 28, at that time the youngest full professor of law in the school's history. He was appointed Felix Frankfurter professor of law in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing his {{outstanding}} form in Serie A {{and in the}} Champions League for the 2010–11 campaign, he was pivotal to Inter's attack line. On 16 March 2011, Eto'o gave {{a legendary}} performance in Munich as he helped Inter eliminate Bayern Munich 3–2 (with an aggregate score of 3–3, winning on away goals) in the Champions League. Eto'o scored the first goal after four minutes, and provided two clinical assists to Wesley Sneijder and to Goran Pandev for the winner. After the game, Inter President Massimo Moratti said, [...] "I'm not sure if the deal that brought Eto'o to the club <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> piece of transfer business ever, but I really {{think it was a}} great piece of business for us. Eto'o is fantastic. I do not want to take anything away from Ibrahimović, but for everyone it was really a great deal to get Eto'o. Samuel is truly extraordinary." [...] On 29 May, Eto'o scored two goals in the final of the Coppa Italia against Palermo to help Inter win 3–1 and taking his total season goals to 37, a new record high for him.|$|E

2500|$|... "The [...] "three R's" [...] of {{rehabilitation}} are exercise, nutrition, and communication. [...] First, I advised Connie {{to step up}} Hogan's exercise to a minimum of thirty minutes of aerobic activity a day. In addition, I advised that Hogan should be fed a low-protein, preservative-free diet. [...] Completing the rehabilitation checklist, I exhorted Connie to work even harder with the sign-language and instructed her on a new sign to use when Hogan started digging. [...] The sign {{was a piece of}} card with the letter 'H' written on it in thick black pen. Connie was to show Hogan this sign as soon as possible after he engaged in a bout of unwanted pawing and then leave the room. [...] The idea was to let him know that the behavior was not wanted by signaling to him that Connie was about to leave the room...Call me a coward, but I didn't think that alone would cut it because of previous experiences with canine compulsive disorders so, employing a belt-and-suspenders strategy, I also advised medicating Hogan with the tricyclic antidepressant Elavil. [...] Theoretically, Elavil wouldn't be that good in obsessive-compulsive behavior but, limited for reasons of expense, and bearing in mind the possible contribution of separation anxiety, Elavil <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> shot." ...|$|E
