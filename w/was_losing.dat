5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season that the company <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that {{he felt that the}} team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{collection}} was returned {{at the end of}} World War II, but the other part was evacuated to Taiwan in 1948 under orders by Chiang Kai-shek, whose Kuomintang <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> the Chinese Civil War.

5|$|When Priestley {{became its}} minister, Mill Hill Chapel {{was one of}} the oldest and most {{respected}} Dissenting congregations in England; however, during the early 18th century the congregation had fractured along doctrinal lines, and <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> members to the charismatic Methodist movement. Priestley believed that by educating the young, he could strengthen the bonds of the congregation.|$|E
5|$|After George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller raised $1million {{dollars to}} buy the Times, along with other fellow editors at the newspaper, {{printing}} it under the New York Times Publishing Company. However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893. By 1896, The New York Times had a circulation of less than 9,000, and <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> $1,000 a day when controlling interest in it was gained by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times for $75,000.|$|E
5|$|After his {{problems}} in the first session, Vettel was fastest in the second session on Friday afternoon. Nico Rosberg was second, about {{a tenth of a}} second behind, but did not set any timed laps in the last twenty minutes as his car <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars made it into the top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso was the fastest Renault-powered car in eighth position, while the McLarens once again had to stop their session early.|$|E

The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September. Recognising the station's historical significance as a mostly unaltered station from the early 20th century, the station was given Grade II listed building status in 2011.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact {{and sought}} dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina's orders, after a {{drawn-out}} bidding process, {{went to an}} American company, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, while Chile's orders, delayed by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil's relations with Argentina were warming and the country's economic boom <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong to remove the third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down Rio de Janeiros keel in March 1910.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{was pressed}} into service, {{delivering}} aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> {{as much as}} ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, {{against the advice of}} Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E
5|$|As President Antonín Novotný <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> support, Alexander Dubček, First Secretary of the {{regional}} Communist Party of Slovakia, and economist Ota Šik challenged him {{at a meeting of}} the Central Committee. Novotný then invited Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev to Prague that December, seeking support; but Brezhnev was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakia's leader. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968. On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by Ludvík Svoboda, who later gave consent to the reforms.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{complaints}} that the MSPB has gone far beyond protecting civil servants from unjustified disciplinary action. Rather, critics allege, the MSPB now makes {{it nearly impossible}} to fire poor performers or problematic employees, even when they have committed egregious violations {{that would result in}} immediate termination in the private sector. According to the CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, [...] "There is no question that taxpayers <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> hundreds of millions of dollars, in a conservative estimate.

5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, the National Hurricane Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical {{during that time}} period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, WNTA-TV <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> money, and the network's {{flagship}} {{station was}} sold to the Educational Broadcasting Corporation that November.

NTA network operations did not continue without a flagship station, although parent company National Telefilm Associates continued syndication services; four television series (Probe, Tintin, The Fair Adventure, and A Day With Doodles) were syndicated by NTA between 1962 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828.

Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{left the}} estate to his son, the current owner Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, {{after his death}} in 1992.
