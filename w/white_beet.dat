50|$|The use {{of sugar}} beets for the {{extraction}} of crystallized sugar dates to 1747, when Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, professor of physics in the Academy of Science of Berlin, discovered {{the existence of a}} sugar in vegetables similar in its properties to that obtained from sugarcane. He found the best of these vegetable sources for {{the extraction of}} sugar was the <b>white</b> <b>beet.</b> Despite Marggraf’s success in isolating pure sugar from beets, their commercial manufacture for sugar did not take off until the early 19th century. Marggraf's student and successor Franz Karl Achard began selectively breeding sugar beet from the 'White Silesian' fodder beet in 1784. By the beginning of the 19th century, his beet was about 5-6% sucrose by (dry) weight, compared to around 20% in modern varieties. Under the patronage of Frederick William III of Prussia, he opened the world's first beet sugar factory in 1801, at Cunern (Polish: Konary) in Silesia.|$|E
50|$|The ICUMSA Methods Book {{contains}} detailed {{instructions for}} analyzing raw, cane, <b>white,</b> <b>beet,</b> molasses, plantation white and specialty sugars. Among these are methods for determination of dry solids content by polarimetry, densimetry and refractometry, color (extinction coefficient at 420 nm), reducing sugars, {{and the presence}} of metals such as arsenic and copper. The Methods Book also contains polynomials and tables (derived from the polynomials) which relate the refractive index of solutions of pure sucrose, glucose, fructose and invert sugar to the strength of those solutions. These are to be used with the analysis methods that characterize sugars by refractometric means but find wide application outside the sugar industry as the sucrose polynomial is built into the firmware of modern refractometers and is the basis for calibration of purely optical refractometers which read in Brix. Temperature correction factors, also derived from the polynomials, are the basis for the Automatic Temperature Compensation features found in those instruments. Thus, a vintner measuring the Brix of juice from his grapes by means of a refractometer accepts a sugar content reading based on the refractive properties of sucrose {{despite the fact that the}} primary sugar in grape juice is fructose, not sucrose. This usually does not result in significant error.|$|E

40|$|Heterodera schachtii_, the <b>white</b> <b>beet</b> cyst nematode, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important nematode pests on sugar beet and is present in most sugar-beet growing areas. The yellow beet cyst nematode, _Heterodera betae_, is less prevalent but has also been found damaging beet crops. However, knowledge about the damage potential and population dynamics of the yellow beet cyst nematode is limited. The amount of damage inflicted by nematodes is dependent on different factors. An important factor influencing the sugar beet yield decline by beet cyst nematodes is the soil temperature. Relationships between soil temperature, _H. schachtii_ population densities and sugar beet yields have been reported previously. Until present, most studies have been conducted under constant temperatures. Since several studies have demonstrated that the population dynamics of many species are sensitive to small differences in temperature (1 - 4 0;C), we subjected in our pot experiment sugar beet plants (cultivar Monza) to 2 gradually increasing temperature regimes in separate climate chambers. Temperatures in the two climate chambers were increased from 8 0;C to 22 0;C and 12 0;C to 26 0;C, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—Peanut plants, Arachis hypogaea, {{infected}} with white mold, Sclerotium rolfsii, emit {{a blend of}} organic compounds that differs both quantitatively and qualitatively from the blend emitted from plants damaged by beet armyworm (BAW; Spodoptera exigua) larvae or from uninfected, undamaged plants. Attack by BAW induced release of lipoxygenase products (hexenols, hexenals, and hexenyl esters), terpenoids, and indole. The plant-derived compound methyl salicylate and the fungal-derived compound 3 -octanone were found only in headspace samples from white mold infected plants. White mold-infected plants exposed to BAW damage released all the volatiles emitted by healthy plants fed on by BAW {{in addition to those}} emitted in response to white mold infection alone. When BAW larvae were given a choice of feeding on leaves from healthy or white mold-infected plants, they consumed larger quantities of the leaves from infected plants. Exposure to commercially available (Z) - 3 hexenyl acetate, linalool, and methyl salicylate, compounds emitted by white mold-infected plants, significantly reduced the growth of the white mold in solid-media cultures. Thus, emission of these compounds by infected plants may constitute a direct defense against this pathogen.

40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} of the lactic acid fermentation of different vegetable juices inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus- that are not constitutive from the epiphytic microbiota of vegetables-were evaluated through some physical and chemical parameters: pH and titratable acidity, expressed in lactic acid. Because the stability and {{the preservation of the}} lacto-fermented juices are important from the technological point of view, the evolution of those ones should be monitored. In this sense, this work targets to find prediction models and curve fittings that express the pH and lactic acid dynamics during lactic acid fermentation of various juices with Lactobacillus acidophilus. With a view to obtain probiotic products, all the vegetable juices (obtained from carrots, red <b>beet,</b> <b>white</b> and red cabbage) were suitable for lactic acid fermentation. Excepting the red beet fermented juice, the others become highly stable after 24 hours, the pH values being 3. 74 - 3. 84, while the lactic acid content was comprised between 6. 3 and 8. 01 g/l. Whether for the consumer the taste should be qualified as excessively sour, the remnant sugars mask this characteristic, ensuring a good taste of the lacto-fermented vegetable juices. At the same time, the red beet juice fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus has reached values of the analyzed indicators that can provide stability to refrigeration.

40|$|Poison hemlock (conium maculatum L.) is a weedy species {{occurring}} in plant communities near field borders and in agrophytocoenosis. It invades into these crops: winter wheat, pea, sugar <b>beet,</b> <b>white</b> mustard {{and also in}} fodder plants. The origin of the invasion lies predominantly in plant communities around field borders. The aim of this thesis was to elaborate survey of poison hemlock occurrence on arable lands and also within plant communities around field margin in the Middle Bohemia. The study was carried on {{with the use of}} GPS navigation (Garmin Etrex 30, Garmin Ltd., USA). Each spot of occurrence was determined by visual recognition in slowly moving car (30 - 40 km/h). Transit between two urban areas was done in both directions every time. Minimal distance between each spot is between 8 - 10 m in this type of determination. Data records were transferred to ortofoto map data layer. The density of plants in each spot was evaluated consequently. The presence of this species in the crops was also evaluated during the survey. 25 field segments of winter canola, two segments of pea, one segment of white mustard and four segments of sugar beet were recorded the studied region. The intensity of the weed infestation around the road network strongly varied. Both solitary plants and consistent stands of poison hemlock were described. The method of evaluation of spot quantity on the longitudinal track was verified in this study.

40|$|Biosolids {{stockpiles}} from {{sewage treatment}} plants are a valuable source {{of organic matter}} which could be utilized to improve the nutritional status and physical properties of Au mine tailings and support the growth of vegetation planted in the tailings. However, biosolids often contain elevated concentrations of heavy metals including Hg while Au mine tailings would usually contain residual Au. Therefore, it would be beneficial to select plants capable of both tolerating and phytoextracting Hg and/or Au. This paper reports on a glasshouse-based screening study which examined the growth of plant species known {{for their ability to}} phytoextract Hg and/or Au which can grow on substrates consisting of biosolids, Au mine tailings, or different combinations of both. The germination and establishment of plants over 8 - 12 weeks were monitored for Brassica juncea (Indian mustard), Daucus carota (carrot), Lupinus albus (white lupin), Beta vulgaris (sugar beet), Solanum tuberosum (potato), and Manihot esculenta (cassava). Each plant species exhibited differential responses in terms of germination, seedling quality, leaf area, specific leaf area, root and shoot biomass, and percentage dry matter partitioning to the roots. Both the Indian mustard and carrot grew successfully in the biosolids-mine tailings substrate combinations while <b>white</b> lupin, sugar <b>beet,</b> cassava, and potato failed to grow in most of the substrate combinations. The most suitable biosolids-mine tailings combination was determined to be 75 % biosolids – 25 % mine tailings, wherein most of the abovementioned growth parameters did not differ significantly from those of the plants grown in the control potting mix...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} 2 -D model for {{simulation}} of root density and plant nitrogen (N) uptake for crops grown in agricultural systems, {{based on a}} modification of the root density equation originally proposed by Gerwitz and Page (1974). A root system form parameter was introduced to describe the distribution of root length vertically and horizontally in the soil profile. The form parameter can vary from 0 where root density is evenly distributed through the soil profile, to 8 where practically all roots are found near the surface. The root model has other components describing root features, such as specific root length and plant N uptake kinetics. The same approach is used to distribute root length horizontally, allowing simulation of root growth and plant N uptake in row crops. The rooting depth penetration rate and depth distribution of root density {{were found to be}} the most important parameters controlling crop N uptake from deeper soil layers. The validity of the root distribution model was tested with field data for <b>white</b> cabbage, red <b>beet,</b> and leek. The model was able to simulate very different root distributions, but it was not able to simulate increasing root density with depth as seen in the experimental results for white cabbage. The model was able to simulate N depletion in different soil layers in two field studies. One included vegetable crops with very different rooting depths and the other compared effects of spring wheat and winter wheat. In both experiments variation in spring soil N availability and depth distribution was varied by the use of cover crops. This shows the model sensitivity to the form parameter value and the ability of the model to reproduce N depletion in soil layers. This work shows that the relatively simple root model developed, driven by degree days and simulated crop growth, can be used to simulate crop soil N uptake and depletion appropriately in low N input vegetable production systems, with a requirement of few measured parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} papers it {{has been}} shown that unheated plant tissue, in the form of potato, contains the two factors necessary for the growth of organisms of the hemoglobinophilic group. Further studies (5) confirmed these findings and showed that yellow and <b>white</b> turnip, carrot, <b>beet,</b> parsnip, and sweet potato can replace blood in the cultivation of Bacillus influenzæ. In the present paper {{it has been}} shown that vegetable tissues also greatly facilitate and stimulate the growth of other organisms entirely unrelated to Bacillus influenzæ. Three varieties of Gram-positive cocci have been used in the present study, pneumococcus, Streptococcus hamolyticus, and Streptococcus viridans. With pneumococcus it has been previously shown that prompt and luxuriant growth will occur in broth containing unheated potato even though the seeding be so small that no growth whatever will occur with the same seeding in plain broth (5). In the present study {{it has been shown}} that even in dextrose broth this minimal inoculation is followed by a prolonged period of lag, whereas in potato broth this same inoculum serves to initiate immediate and rapid growth. When pneumococci are grown in potato broth not only is the period of lag abolished, but the stationary period of growth is extended and cell death is delayed. Moreover, in plant tissue medium the zone of hydrogen ion concentration within which growth of pneumococcus can be initiated is considerably extended beyond the acid and alkaline limits of the optimal range in ordinary bouillon. It has been found also that the presence of unheated plant tissue in the media likewise stimulates growth of hemolytic and non-hemolytic streptococci. In this investigation no attempt has been made to determine the exact nature of the substances in plant tissue upon which these properties depend. That they are not of the nature of readily fermentable carbohydrates, however, is made evident by the fact that no increased production of acid occurs in the pneumococcus culture when potato is present...|$|R
40|$|In plant {{breeding}} it {{is a common}} observation to see genotypes react differently to environmental changes. This phenomenon is called genotype by environment interaction. Many statistical approaches for analysing genotype by environment interaction rely heavily on the analysis of variance model. Genotype by environment interaction is then taken to be equivalent to non-additivity. This thesis criticizes the analysis of variance approach. Modelling genotype by environment interaction by non-additivity is little parsimonious and interaction patterns remain hard to interpret. Interpretation is hindered by the multitude of parameters that require interpretation and the fact that these parameters do not refer to external genotypic and environmental information. A viable alternative is presented in the form of multiplicative models for interaction. The latter can be distinguished in two classes; factorial regression models and multilinear models. Factorial regression models describe genotype by environment interaction in direct relation to explicit external genotypic and environmental covariables. They are ordinary linear models that allow the testing of biologically interesting hypotheses about the mechanisms responsible for genotype by environment interaction. Multilinear models are based on low rank approximations to the tables of non-additivity parameters. Parameter estimates can be obtained from multiplicative decompositions of the non-additivity tables. Multilinear models guarantee a parsimonious description of the interaction. When genotypic and environmental interaction parameters are plotted simultaneously in so-called biplots, the emerging patterns often allow biologically interesting conclusions. The successful application of multiplicative models for interaction is illustrated for a number of variables in a number of crops like <b>white</b> cabbage, sugar <b>beet</b> perennial ryegrass, lettuce, wheat, potato and maize. The data came from {{plant breeding}}, resistance breeding, variety trials, and seed technology research. Theoretical contributions include the introduction of reduced rank factorial regression models in plant breeding, the development of generalized bilinear models, and the implementation of quadrilinear models for three-way non-additivity. In addition, the use of diagnostic biplots as a model screening device for two-way tables is described and evaluated. Besides applied and theoretical papers, the thesis contains extensive reviews of the possibilities of linear and bilinear models for modelling genotype by evironment interaction. Two opinion papers provide conceptual clarifications. The thesis not only addresses plant breeders interested in modelling genotype by environment interaction, but also statisticians and researchers interested in parsimonious modelling of interactions...|$|R
