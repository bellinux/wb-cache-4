5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play <b>with</b> <b>Max</b> Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise.

I can recall only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E
