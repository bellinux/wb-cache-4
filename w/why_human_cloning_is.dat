25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>is</b> the {{creation}} of a genetically identical copy of a human.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the moral, ethical and legal aspects of reproductive <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> After examining {{the facts about}} cloning, this thesis tackles the difficult question of whether <b>humans</b> should <b>be</b> <b>cloned.</b> This <b>is</b> explored through an in-depth analysis of the moral and ethical acceptability of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> The author concludes that <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> should never <b>be</b> attempted and that consequently such a practice should be permanently prohibited by a legal norm. This thesis then surveys national legislation and international law {{to see if there}} presently exists a prohibition of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> This thesis then examines possible future legal action regarding <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> and suggests a legislative scheme. Finally, possible constitutional challenges to future Canadian legislation prohibiting <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. This analysis focuses on the right to liberty and the right to security of the person entrenched in section 7 and the right to equality embodied in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The author concludes that such challenges would likely be unsuccessful...|$|R

25|$|Two {{commonly}} discussed {{types of}} theoretical <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>are</b> therapeutic <b>cloning</b> and reproductive cloning.

Two common methods of therapeutic <b>cloning</b> that <b>are</b> being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire <b>cloned</b> <b>human,</b> instead of just specific cells or tissues.|$|R
40|$|Many new {{reproductive}} {{methods such as}} artificial insemination, {{in vitro}} fertilisation, freezing of human embryos, and surrogate motherhood were at first widely condemned but are now seen in Western society as not just ethically and morally acceptable, but beneficial in that they allow otherwise infertile couples to have children.

This article examines cloning from a Jewish perspective and finds {{evidence to support the}} view that there is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> A hypothesis <b>is</b> also advanced suggesting that even if a body <b>was</b> <b>cloned,</b> the brain, which is the essence of humanity, would remain unique.

5000|$|There {{are certain}} Protestant {{denominations}} {{that do not}} disagree with the acceptability of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> Mary Seller, for example, {{a member of the}} Church of England's Board of Social Responsibility and a professor of developmental genetics, states, [...] "Cloning, like all science, must <b>be</b> used responsibly. <b>Cloning</b> <b>humans</b> <b>is</b> not desirable.

[...] On the other hand, according to a survey of Christian fundamentalist pastors, responses indicated a [...] "common account of <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> as primarily reproductive in nature, proscribed by its violation of God's will and role." [...] Many of these pastors acknowledged the reason for this violation being rooted in the religiously motivated view that <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>is</b> an example of scientists 'playing God.'" [...] It is not only this that many Christians are concerned about, however; other concerns include whether the dignity of the human person is overlooked, as well as the role of the parents as co-creators. All of these things may contribute to why many fundamentalist Christian pastors see <b>human</b> reproductive <b>cloning</b> as simply [...] "forbidden territory." ...|$|R
