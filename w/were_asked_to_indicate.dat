5|$|According to the Bureau of Immigration, 54,057 Armenians {{entered the}} US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed {{countries}} of origin were Turkey (46,474), Russia (3,034), Canada (1,577), Great Britain (914) and Egypt (894). Immigrants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> which state {{they were going to}} settle in; for Armenians, the most popular answers were New York (17,391), Massachusetts (14,192), Rhode Island (4,923), Illinois (3,313), California (2,564), New Jersey (2,115), Pennsylvania (2,002), Michigan (1,371). The largest Armenian American communities at that time were located in New York City; Fresno; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston; Philadelphia; Chicago; Jersey City; Detroit; Los Angeles; Troy, New York; and Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{regarding}} statistical cues to phonological acquisition is {{a phenomenon}} known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to {{the same category as}} the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme. If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities, Trueswell et al. {{conducted a series of}} experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{measures}} of willingness to recommend involve a survey {{with a set}} of statements using a Likert Technique or scale. The customer <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> how willing they are to make a recommendation (of a brand, service, etc.) to others. Their willingness is generally measured on a five-point scale.|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{also looked}} to see if one’s reading direction, left to right or right to left affects one’s {{preference}} for either a left to right directionality or a right to left directionality in pictures. Participants were shown images {{as well as its}} mirror image, and <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> which they found more aesthetically pleasing. Overall, results indicate that one’s reading directionality impacts one’s preference for pictures either with left to right directionality or right to left directionality.|$|E
50|$|In Experiment 1 of Arnold et al., (2008), a {{white noise}} pattern and a target image {{switched}} between both eyes at selected constant rates.

5000|$|This study {{conducted}} by Lee investigates the effects of deindividuation on group polarization. Group polarization refers to the finding that following group discussion, individuals tend to endorse a more extreme position in the direction already favored by the group. In Lee’s study subjects were either assigned to a deindividuation or individuation condition. Next, each subject answered questions and provided an argument about a given dilemma. They were then shown their partners’ decisions and the subjects <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> how convincing and valid the overall arguments were.

50|$|Cardinal Angelo Amato {{presided over}} the {{declaration}} ceremony {{on behalf of the}} Congregation for the Causes of Saints. He later revealed that Pope Benedict XVI approved and signed the official promulgation decrees recognising the miracles as authentic and worthy of belief. The College of Cardinals were then sent a dossier on the new saints, and they <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> their approval. On February 18, 2012, after the Consistory for the Creation of Cardinals, Cardinal Amato formally petitioned Pope Benedict XVI to announce the canonization of the new saints. The Pope set the date for the canonization ceremony to October 21, 2012 on World Mission Sunday, 340 years after Calungsod's death.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} question formats, especially the semantic differential format where the respondent must choose {{a point on}} a one-dimensional scale anchored by two semantically opposite terms, the diamond of opposites allows the respondent to express attraction and repulsion independently. In this format, the stem describes an object, person or situation in relation to which the respondent <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> their degree of attraction and repulsion. The two variables are plotted on two orthogonal axes.|$|R
30|$|A {{lightweight}} {{instrument to}} measure mood {{is the so-called}} Faces Scale (Andrews and Whitey 1976). This non-verbal scale shows seven faces ranging from “very sad” to “very happy”. Participants <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> the face, which matches their current mood best. Another questionnaire is the Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS) (Mayer and Gaschke 1988). The BMIS consists of 16 items (plus one global item) and measures mood on four sub-scales (Pleasant-Unpleasant Mood, Arousal-Calm Mood, Positive-Tired Mood, Negative-Relaxed Mood).|$|R
5000|$|In {{another study}} drivers <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> {{how much time}} they feel can be saved when {{increasing}} from either a low (30 mph) or high (60 mph) speed (Fuller et al., 2009). For example, participants were asked the following question: [...] "You are driving along an open road. How much time {{do you feel you}} would gain if you drove for 10 miles at 40 mph instead of 30 mph?" [...] (Fuller et al., 2009, p. 14). Another question had a higher starting speed (60 mph) and two other questions asked about losing time when decreasing speed (from either 30 or 60 mph).|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, and Fetter {{conducted}} an important study using the five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, courtesy, and civic virtue.

50|$|This theory {{states that}} {{participants}} do not acquire the abstract rules exactly {{as stated by}} the artificial grammar. Instead, participants develop their own rules based on small sections of each letter string. For example, they may notice that an F always comes after an M. The existing AGL paradigm is criticized for having only two responses: grammatical or non-grammatical. In one study, participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> why they felt a certain sentence was grammatical or non-grammatical. In the test phase, the participants were told to either cross out the part of each string that made it non-grammatical, or underline the part that made it grammatical. This indicated the microrules that each participant was consciously applying. The results showed that participants acquired {{a large number of}} imperfect and limited rules, however, they do lead to consistently correct judgments of grammaticality and non-grammaticality.|$|E

50|$|Likert scale - Respondents <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> {{the amount}} of {{agreement}} or disagreement (from strongly agree to strongly disagree) on a five- to nine-point response scale (not {{to be confused with}} a Likert scale). The same format is used for multiple questions. It is the combination of these questions that forms the Likert scale. This categorical scaling procedure can easily be extended to a magnitude estimation procedure that uses the full scale of numbers rather than verbal categories.|$|R
