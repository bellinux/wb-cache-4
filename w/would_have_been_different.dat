5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) {{is another}} significant, {{specific}} criminal procedural right {{guaranteed by the}} due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, {{and there is a}} reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> ("materiality"). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{explicit}} {{racial discrimination}} in the Rhodesian political system before 1969. It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully {{in the political process}} then the outcome of the 1962 general election <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> and UDI would have been avoided. African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register, and those that had registered not to vote. Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote, and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25%.|$|E

25|$|In practice, IRV {{does not}} seem to {{discourage}} candidacies. In Australia's House of Representatives elections in 2007, for example, the average number of candidates in a district was seven, and at least four candidates ran in every district; notwithstanding the fact that Australia only has two major political parties. Every seat was won with a majority of the vote, including several where results <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> under plurality voting. A study of ballot image data found that all of the 138 RCV elections held in four Bay Area cities in California elected the Condorcet winner, including many with large fields of candidates and 46 where multiple rounds of counting were required to determine a winner.|$|E
25|$|However, these {{hypotheses}} were all refuted {{by the late}} 1960s and early 1970s Apollo lunar missions, which introduced a stream of new scientific evidence; specifically concerning the Moon's composition, its age, and its history. These lines of evidence contradict many predictions made by these earlier models. The rocks brought back from the Moon showed a marked decrease in water relative to rocks elsewhere in the Solar System, and also evidence of an ocean of magma early in its history, indicating that its formation must have produced {{a great deal of}} energy. Also, oxygen isotopes in lunar rocks showed a marked similarity to those on Earth, suggesting that they formed at a similar location in the solar nebula. The capture model fails to explain the similarity in these isotopes (if the Moon had originated {{in another part of the}} Solar System, those isotopes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different),</b> while the co-accretion model cannot adequately explain the loss of water (if the Moon formed in a similar fashion to the Earth, the amount of water trapped in its mineral structure would also be roughly similar). Conversely, the fission model, while it can account for the similarity in chemical composition and the lack of iron in the Moon, cannot adequately explain its high orbital inclination and, in particular, the large amount of angular momentum in the Earth–Moon system, more than any other planet–satellite pair in the Solar System.|$|E

Washington (1984), the Court held that, on {{collateral}} review, {{a defendant}} may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates both (1) that defense counsel's performance fell below an objective {{standard of reasonableness}} (the [...] "performance prong") and (2) that, but for the deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that {{the result of the}} proceeding <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> (the [...] "prejudice prong").|$|E

500|$|Both teams {{attempted}} {{to blame the}} other for allowing the violence {{to get out of}} hand. Soviet official Anatoly Kastriukov blamed a Canadian trainer for igniting hostilities by running over to the Soviet bench and punching one of their assistant coaches in the stomach. The Canadians, meanwhile, pointed to Davydov being the first off the bench as being the spark that led to the brawl. CBC commentator Don Cherry {{was one of the first}} to float a conspiracy theory that the Soviets had done so as a deliberate attempt to have Canada ejected, and therefore lose a medal. [...] Alan Eagleson suggested that the IIHF's decision <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> had it been the Soviets in contention for a medal, and not the Canadians.|$|E

500|$|The Toronto Sun {{and sister}} paper Ottawa Sun printed a cartoon {{featuring}} [...] "a curvy, spaghetti-strapped slip" [...] {{made of the}} same materials as the meat dress. The editorial cartoon suggested readers cut out the image, smear it with foodstuffs, and mail it to [...] Nemiroff; her address was included with the image. The mailroom opened mail with gloves for weeks after the cartoon; one was covered in feces.

The writer for Canadian Art suggested reaction <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if the genders of the artist and curator were different, that the work would have likely been deemed sexist, for starters. In all, 200 people mailed food scraps to the National Gallery of Canada within a week.|$|E
500|$|After {{six months}} of incarceration, Hananu was {{subsequently}} put on trial on 15 March 1922, with {{the charges against him}} including murder, organizing rebel bands, engaging in brigandage and the destruction of public property and infrastructure. He was defended by the Aleppine Christian attorney, Fathallah Saqqal. In court, Hananu condemned the [...] "illegal occupation of Syria" [...] and argued that military operations were done under the aegis of Mustafa Kemal. The trial became a rallying point of popular support for Hananu and a led to a significant degree of solidarity among Aleppo's urban elite who collectively supported Hananu's freedom. The trial concluded on 18 March, and Hananu was acquitted after the court decided that he was not a rebel, but rather a soldier who was legally mandated by the Ottoman authorities to engage in warfare against French forces. According to Khoury, the [...] "verdict <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> ... had Hananu not become a legend in his own time" [...] and if the Franco-Turkish War had not ended.|$|E
500|$|In a 1 April 2011 {{article in}} the Washington Post {{reflecting}} on the Commission's work, Goldstone wrote that the report <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> {{if he had been}} aware of information that has become known since its issuance. While expressing regret that Israel's failure to co-operate with the Commission had hindered its ability to gather exculpatory facts, he approved Israel's subsequent internal investigations into incidents described in the report as well as their establishment of policies to better protect civilians in future conflicts. He contrasted the Israeli reaction with the failure of Hamas to investigate or modify their methods and procedures. Goldstone said he had hoped that the Commission's inquiry [...] "would begin a new era of evenhandedness at the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted". In addition, {{according to a report in}} Haaretz, Goldstone told associates in early 2011 that [...] "he has been in great distress and under duress" [...] ever since publication of his report.|$|E

500|$|In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, {{against the}} advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitler at his Berghof retreat in Bavaria. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes. The former Austrian ambassador, Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein, who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, {{believed}} that Edward favoured German fascism as a bulwark against communism, and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany. According to the Duke of Windsor, the experience of [...] "the unending scenes of horror" [...] during the First World War led him to support appeasement. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Nazi Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward {{if it were not for}} the abdication. Albert Speer quoted Hitler directly: [...] "I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> His abdication was a severe loss for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E
500|$|Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark {{leading the}} Democratic field of {{candidates}} or as {{a close second}} to Howard Dean with the Gallup poll having him in {{first place in the}} presidential race at 20% as late as October 2003. [...] The John Edwards campaign brought on Hugh Shelton—the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to [...] "integrity and character issues"—as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign. Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the Iowa caucuses, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The 2004 Iowa caucuses marked {{a turning point in the}} campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and Dick Gephardt garnered results far lower than expected, and John Kerry and John Edwards' campaigns benefited in Clark's absence. Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, including a tie for third place with Edwards in the New Hampshire primary and a narrow victory in the Oklahoma primary over Edwards. However, he saw his third-place finishes in Tennessee and Virginia as signs that he had lost the South, a focus of his campaign. He withdrew from the race on February 11, 2004, and announced his endorsement of John Kerry at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 13. Clark believed his opting out of the Iowa caucus was one of his campaign's biggest mistakes, saying to one supporter the day before he withdrew from the race that [...] "everything <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if we had [...]" ...|$|E
