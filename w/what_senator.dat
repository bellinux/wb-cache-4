40|$|Extract] What {{precisely}} does Australia's deeper {{engagement with}} Asia entail? Over {{the last two}} years the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia has sponsored a project - the Australian-Asian Perceptions Project - designed to examine differences in culture or 'world view' which can cause misunderstanding and confusion in Australian-Asian relations. The Project tackles <b>what</b> <b>Senator</b> Evans has called Australia's' otherness'-'our unique character and position as viewed by our neighbours' - and also the 'otherness' of Asian countries as seen by Australia and by each other. The Australian-Asian Perceptions Project seeks to influence the intellectual framework within which Government and the private sector respond to apparent uncertainty and ambiguity in our commercial, political and security relations. One of the strategies adopted by the Australian-Asian Perceptions Project to achieve these ends is to undertake a series of 'comparative perceptions studies'. These studies identify and examine the significance of specific 'master-ideas' operating in Australia and the different countries of the Asian region. Each study examines a particular field of activity which has aroused concern in Australian-Asian relations. The fields include the education process, business ethics, labour relations, expectations of government, the role of the media, human rights, democracy and national security. The strategy adopted in the comparative studies has been somewhat unusual. Groups of specialists - combining expertise in a range of different disciplines and areas - work together for a five-day period to produce a draft paper. Collaboration of this type is rare in that it involves specialists both on Australia and one or more Asian societies, including in some cases scholars based in Asian countries. Furthermore, the writing groups usually interviewed people' both from within and outside the academic world who have had a range of experience in the field under study. The hot-house atmosphere of these workshops -'composition meetings' was the phrase employed to underline the organisers' determination to produce written matter as well as ideas - was not always conducive to the preparation of disciplined drafts. Much re-writing has taken place since the meetings were held, often requiring a series of later mini-workshops involving some or all members of the writing group. Editors have played a major role, as have expert readers, and the result is, naturally, not in accord with the views of every contributor at all points. This paper is concerned with a topic which is constantly described as being of vital importance to Australia's economic engagement with the Asian region. It considers the proposition that Australian and 'Asian' approaches to labour relations differ radically. Can we speak of' Asian' approaches and, if so, is it possible to portray them as 'harmonious' in contrast to a tradition of confrontation existing in Australia? The discussion covers the role of law, government and trade unions, and includes speculation about likely future trends in labour relations. Finally, we examine work situations in which management and labour come from different societies and cultures...|$|E
40|$|Will the {{government}} have the courage of John Faulkner 2 ̆ 7 s convictions, asks GEOFFREY BARKER MONEY is the lifeblood of modern election campaigns. It fuels the expensive electronic advertising {{as well as the}} interminable polling surveys that shape political messages. Political parties therefore struggle remorselessly to extract dollars from every possible source by any possible means. This state of affairs has potentially grave implications for the integrity of Australian democracy, particularly when the sources and amounts of political donations, and the conditions on which they are made, are unclear or undisclosed. Political parties risk being seen to be auctioning access and influence to those with the deepest pockets, effectively giving them the best government that money can buy. Last March the special minister for state, Senator John Faulkner, announced that the federal government would introduce legislation to immediately close loopholes in political donation disclosure and public funding laws. He also announced {{the government}} would produce a green paper on wider and longer term electoral reform. It is proving an extraordinarily challenging initiative. The federal opposition has moved to delay and to derail the process. Within the Labor Party there are marked differences between electoral reformers like Faulkner and federal and state party administrators and leaders who are resisting reforms that might compromise their easy access to dollars. In June, the Liberals used their majority in the Senate to refer Faulkner’s bill to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) for inquiry and report by 30 June next year. The green paper, which was to have been released in two parts in July and next month, has yet to be seen, although it is now said likely to released within weeks. Meanwhile the Labor chair of JSCEM, Daryl Melham, is pushing to conclude the committee’s report on the political donations aspect of its inquiry by next month - nearly a year early. Now that the Liberals no longer control the Senate, {{he should be able to}} do so with support from minor party senators who tend to support campaign finance reform. But it remains deeply uncertain when or to what extent Faulkner is likely to achieve substantial reform of electoral donation laws and eventually reform of broader electoral processes. The politics of the issue are byzantine, cross-cutting and massively coloured by political self-interest on all sides. Faulkner’s bill to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act has five main purposes. First, it would reduce the donations disclosure threshold to 1000, reversing the Howard government’s huge increase in 2007 which took the disclosure limit from 1500 to more than 10, 000. Second, it would ban foreign and anonymous donations to registered political parties, candidates and members of Senate groups and prevent the use of foreign and anonymous donations for political spending. Third, it would limit the potential for “donation splitting” to prevent separate divisions of a political party from being treated as separate entities and enabling large donations to be hidden by dividing them between state branches of parties. Fourth, it would introduce a claims system for electoral funding and tie funding to electoral expenditure to stop candidates from gaining from the funding system. Fifth, it would introduce twice-yearly disclosure of donations to increase public scrutiny and transparency. The shadow minister for state, Liberal Senator Michael Ronaldson, has accused Labor of “cherry-picking” and pre-empting its green paper by introducing its first electoral reform legislation before the green paper is published. Senator Ronaldson has justified the opposition’s move to send the proposals to JSCEM until next year on the ground that the opposition wants a broad and bipartisan approach. He has said Labor is trying to stack the deck and has not consulted. “What we see in this bill is 100 per cent of what Labor head office wants,” he has said. He has also has reflected Coalition scepticism about the Faulkner proposals, especially the proposal to reduce the Howard government’s 10, 000 disclosure threshold to 1000. “The ALP has not shown that the current system of disclosure of donations is broken,” he has said. <b>What</b> <b>Senator</b> Ronaldson has not said is what disclosure threshold the opposition would support. Various former and current Liberal MPs have also suggested that lowering the disclosure threshold would disproportionately disadvantage the Liberals whose individual and business donors might be reluctant to be identified. They have also suggested that large trade union donations to Labor should be scrutinised as part of campaign finance reform. Senator Faulkner has sought to confront the opposition’s delaying tactics by pledging to include trade union affiliation fees to Labor in the examination of electoral finance issues. He has also flagged possible caps on overall expenditure by parties and increases in taxpayer funding of political parties. But Senator Faulkner’s problems are not restricted to Coalition tactics. Victorian Premier John Brumby has opposed moves to ban political donations, saying that “providing there is proper scrutiny and proper reporting of donations I think it is a good thing if the community and business and unions are more involved in political and public life. ” What Brumby means by “proper” is not canvassed, but his remarks reflect a deeper concern with dollars than with reform of a secretive and potentially shonky system. And Labor National Secretary Tim Gartrell has reacted with self-righteous indignation to criticism by Senator Ronaldson of a Labor proposal that seemed suspiciously like an access-for-cash scheme offering business representatives the chance to pay 15, 000, 25, 000 or 50, 000 to attend meetings with ministers. Gartrell told the Australian’s Glenn Milne (18 August) that Ronaldson was at ease with Coalition business membership schemes such as the Liberals’ Millenium Forum and the Nationals’ Business Observer program. He accused Ronaldson of hypocrisy and said only Labor supported scrapping Howard’s 10, 000 disclosure threshold. But he was silent on the Labor paid-access offer to business, observing merely that “all the major parties have business membership schemes”. Clearly there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around in this area of policy. The reason is not hard to find. In Political Finance in Australia: A Skewed and Secret System (PDF), a 2006 report for the Democratic Audit of Australia, Sally Young and Joo-Cheong Tham observed that there were two central problems with the funding of Australian political parties. The first was that a lack of transparency was a hallmark of private funding, political spending and the use of parliamentary entitlements and government resources. Second, and more important, was the political inequality maintained and perpetuated by Australian political finance. “The distribution of private funds favors the Coalition and the ALP and so do election funding, parliamentary entitlements and state resources like government advertising”, the Audit said. Confronted by these realities it is not surprising that Senator Faulkner is facing an uphill battle. While he is a sincere and determined reformer, the final result of his efforts may be less than he hoped to achieve given the resistance within his the Labor Party - although he will find a willing ally in JSCEM’s Daryl Melham, who has supported passage of the Electoral Act financial disclosure reforms and undelayed consideration of the green paper. Much will depend on what the green paper proposes. It is being drawn up jointly by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Australian Electoral Commission and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. How far the green paper goes towards matching the courage of Faulkner’s convictions will be a critical test of the eventual extent of electoral reform in Australia. So, of course, will be what the Senate minor parties are prepared to accept. • Geoffrey Barker is a visiting fellow at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University.

40|$|Narrowing {{the grounds}} for refugee appeals doesn’t make sense, even in the government’s terms, argues Frank Brennan All seven judges of the High Court have thrown out Minister Ruddock’s attempt to deny asylum seekers access to the courts. The government’s {{intention}} was that once the Refugee Review Tribunal had reviewed a decision to refuse a protection visa {{there would be no}} appeal possible to the courts. In the case decided on 4 February, a Bangladeshi person who was refused a visa appealed to the courts on the ground that he was denied natural justice because the tribunal took into account adverse material which was relevant to his case without giving him notice of the material and without giving him any opportunity to address it. The High Court has said that persons in this situation can still appeal to the courts. They can appeal not only to the High Court, but also to the Federal Court and the new Federal Magistrates’ Court. Importantly, the High Court, despite attempts by the government to stop this practice, can still remit such matters to lower courts to avoid the High Court being clogged with such cases. Chief Justice Gleeson insisted on the need for decision makers not only to act in good faith but also with fairness and detachment: ‘the requirement of a fair hearing is a limitation upon the decision-making authority of the Tribunal of such a nature that it is inviolable. ’ The Chief Justice said that the broad reading which the Commonwealth tried to give to its privative clause was inconsistent with four principles of statutory interpretation: 1. If the words are ambiguous, the court should interpret the words consistent with Australia’s international obligations 2. The court should not impute to the Parliament an intention to abrogate or curtail fundamental rights or freedoms 3. The Australian Constitution is framed {{on the assumption that the}} rule of law applies to actions by the executive government 4. The court presumes that the parliament does not intend to deprive a person access to the courts except to the extent expressly stated or necessarily implied. It is not enough for the immigration officers or the RRT simply to establish that they acted in good faith. Asylum seekers, like the rest of us, are entitled to expect fairness. The Chief Justice concluded: ‘Parliament has not evinced an intention that a decision by the Tribunal to confirm a refusal of a protection visa, made unfairly, and in contravention of the requirements of natural justice, shall stand so long as it was a bona fide attempt to decide whether or not such a visa should be granted. ’ Five of the other judges pointed out that the Migration Act is a very complex piece of legislation and any decision made by the Minister or the RRT must be a decision made under the Act. They said ‘it is impossible to conclude that the Parliament intended to effect a repeal of all statutory limitations or restraints upon the exercise of power or the making of a decision’. The privative clause comes into play, excluding court review, only if the error made by the decision maker is a ‘non-jurisdictional error’ - in other words, an error made within the jurisdiction which the decision maker has. The Australian Constitution guarantees that Courts must always be able to assess whether a Commonwealth decision maker has made a decision within their jurisdiction. Five of the judges were very scathing in stating that ‘the fundamental premise for the legislation’ was ‘unsound’. They went out of their way to make it plain that this litigation is not a mere word game. They said: It is important to emphasise that the difference in understanding what has been decided about privative clauses is real and substantive; it is not some verbal or logical quibble. It is real and substantive because it reflects two fundamental constitutional propositions, both of which the Commonwealth accepts. First, the jurisdiction of this Court to grant relief under s 75 (v) of the Constitution cannot be removed by or under a law made by the Parliament. Specifically, the jurisdiction to grant s 75 (v) relief where there has been jurisdictional error by an officer of the Commonwealth cannot be removed. Secondly, the judicial power of the Commonwealth cannot be exercised otherwise than in accordance with Ch III. The Parliament cannot confer on a non-judicial body the power to conclusively determine the limits of its own jurisdiction. There is guaranteed constitutional access to the courts to correct jurisdictional errors by the RRT and the Minister. This guarantee covers any application based on the claim that the minister or the tribunal has not acted with fairness and detachment. Even Justice Callinan, who wrote on his own, pointed out that Parliament could not set time limits on access to the courts ‘as to make any constitutional right of recourse virtually illusory’. How then did the government get it so wrong? Weren’t they warned? Yes they were. Locking out the courts has been one of Minister Ruddock’s abiding passions. He first tried introducing this legislation in June 1997, and again in September 1997. Back then, the Labor Opposition opposed the legislation and accurately predicted that ‘the Coalition will probably fail in this objective. The jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be totally excluded’. Mr Ruddock claimed that the legislation had been given the tick by a bevy of silks including Tom Hughes QC, once a Liberal Attorney-General. But that seemed a dubious claim once Mr Hughes appeared before the Senate committee in January 1999 saying, ‘the entrenched constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court to grant what is called prerogative relief [...] . cannot be eradicated and abrogated, except by passage of legislation after a referendum’. He warned that the ‘passage of this bill would produce the altogether undesirable effects to which two former chief justices, Sir Anthony Mason and Sir Gerard Brennan, had alluded’. A month before Mr Hughes had come out and given evidence in his personal capacity, Minister Ruddock was so cocksure of his position (which has now been discredited 7 to nil in the High Court) that he told Parliament, ‘My good friend Sir Gerard Brennan has misunderstood in part the nature of the provisions that we are proposing. ’ Hughes, Mason and Brennan understood all too well. It was only in the aftermath of Tampa that the government was emboldened enough and the Opposition was beaten enough in the retreat from legal principle that this privative clause was then passed by the Parliament. Now we are all to pay the price with added uncertainty with future litigation because the government wanted to play fast and loose, tampering with constitutional principle despite all the warnings. Now any disaffected asylum seeker can appeal to the courts (including the federal Magistrates Court) alleging that they have been denied a fair hearing. Rather than complaining about this outcome, Minister Ruddock should heed the call of Tom Hughes when he addressed the Senate Committee four years ago: It seems to me that the driving force behind this proposed legislation is economy of administration - a very laudable objective in itself, although perhaps it can sometimes be carried as an objective to undue lengths. What the committee might like to ask itself, looking at the matter on a more general level than the strictly legal, is this: we are, as I said, an affluent and a free society. It is in the nature of things, that being such a society, people claiming to be oppressed and to be the victim of injustice in their own countries will be forever knocking on our doors. It is one of the burdens of being a free society that we should, you may think, provide a system of dealing with persons claiming to be refugees which is as legally certain as any branch of the law can be and that has established and clearly understood legal criteria of exemption or liability. Really, this is picking up on <b>what</b> <b>Senator</b> Cooney has said. The committee may, in that context, be inclined to ask their respective selves whether this legislation, as has been pointed out, attempts to propound a test of the validity of administrative decisions which is unclear and has never been fully considered by the High Court, which test may turn out to be a case of the cure, or the supposed cure, being worse than the present disease - if there is a disease. Is it really a disease, we being a society with the incomparable advantages that we have, to have the present system with clear guidelines of judicial review - including review in the High Court - even though that is a system that will be more expensive to run, possibly, than the system which is designed to replace it? Is it not one way that we can repay a debt that we owe to society to incur expense in testing by a coherent system of legal regulation which the present one is, albeit expensive? Is that not a debt that we can cheerfully pay, a burden that we can willingly shoulder, even though it is a more expensive system than the one that is designed to replace it? The proviso I make to that last observation is that because of the uncertainty of the legal test that is propounded, the proposed new system may be no less expensive than the old. It is a case, perhaps, in which members of all political persuasion can consider that sometimes conservatism, in the best sense of the word, is not a bad idea. Now that the High Court has established beyond doubt that a privative clause cannot be devised to exclude refugee decisions from the courts, it is time for the executive government to design a process for the orderly determination of these matters in the courts. Back in September 1997, Mr Ruddock told Parliament that he would look after matters once the courts were excluded: I do not intend to leave the system flawed. I intend to ensure that the system is run with integrity. I intend to ensure that the former government’s measures to contain abuse of our judicial system are given effect. I want to assure the House that I am intent on ensuring that those people who are genuine are accommodated and at the end of the day there is a safety net; and that safety net is me, as minister. Unfortunately, the other decision delivered by the High Court today reveals that the Minister is not your ordinary safety net. In this decision, it is revealed that Mrs Bakhtyari and her five children have been denied a protection visa by the safety net minister even though it was shown in the course of the litigation that Mrs Bakhtyari only learnt two days after the RRT decision that her husband was lawfully resident in Australia on a TPV, having applied for a permanent protection visa. The Minister’s department knew this but did not see fit specifically to inform the RRT. If the RRT had known this, the RRT would have issued the family with protection visas as a matter of course back in July 2001 because their spouse and father was already recognised as a refugee. Instead the woman and five children have spent an additional 2. 5 years in detention in Woomera and now Baxter. An appropriate safety net requires four strands: public servants with integrity, a dispassionate minister, an informed tribunal and accessible courts. It is time for the executive to respect the role of the courts. Justice French’s observations in the Federal Court deserve consideration in the interests of fair and efficient processing of future cases: There is no doubt that the volume of cases and the time they take impose burdens upon public resources and, for those applicants in immigration detention, may result in protracted periods of incarceration. But experience with the 1992 amendments, even since the 2001 amendments, suggests that narrowing the grounds of review does not reduce the incidence of desperate people with hopeless cases applying to the Court to seek a reversal of tribunal or ministerial decisions. When the 1992 amendments excluded all natural justice grounds except actual bias there appeared to be an increase in the number of cases alleging actual bias. If, under the narrow view of Hickman, want of good faith remains a ground of review, it may be expected that there will be an increased number of applications alleging want of good faith on the part of the decision-maker. The overwhelming majority of applications for judicial review under the Migration Act and the overwhelming majority of appeals from first instance judicial decisions fail. This does not appear to have deterred those affected by adverse decisions from applying for review. Nor has it deterred them from appealing. The surest path to more efficient and expeditious disposition of these cases is likely to be procedural. The imposition of a requirement that no application for review of a tribunal decision, nor any appeal, could be commenced without leave of the Court, or in the case of prerogative writs, the grant of an order nisi, able to be determined on the papers, would go a long way to enabling hopeless cases to be rejected at the threshold. The provision of legal advice about the limited scope of judicial review would also have a part to play in enabling potential applicants or appellants to make better informed decisions. These are practical measures which could alleviate the burden that present processes impose on public resources. Going this path, the government would not be riding any of the populist wave of appeal in the wake of Tampa. But they might be able to design a system of review which respects the Constitution and the traditional Australian way of considering fundamental rights and interests.
