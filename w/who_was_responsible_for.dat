40|$|In {{contrast}} to other studies {{of students in}} online environments, which examine the skills and attitudes that students bring to an online university learning environment, {{we are interested in}} the expectations with which students come to online university study. Four expectational barriers, which arise from students’ background and cultural history, are identified as being: <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> learning, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> student interaction with content, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the use of appropriate learning strategies and <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> required ancillary skills. There is a discussion of how these barriers arise and how one might attempt to manage the students’ expectations and ameliorate their effects. <br /...|$|R

5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the {{damage on the}} German ships.

5|$|The San Joaquin County Jail in French Camp, California. Shortly {{after the}} prison opened, six prisoners escaped after cutting through a one-inch {{bar in the}} dayroom with a hacksaw.

5|$|The {{first time}} a {{prisoner}} tried {{to escape from the}} Bain was in 1993, when a 38-year-old prisoner was able to escape while {{he was supposed to be}} cleaning ice from the parking lot in front of the ship.

5|$|A ten-member {{team led}} by Leonard Reiffel was {{assembled}} at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago to study the potential visibility of the explosion, benefits to science, and implications for the lunar surface.

5|$|The Minister for Home Affairs, King O'Malley, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the {{legislation}} creating the ACT, also {{introduced a bill}} in 1910 making the ACT an alcohol-free area; this bill {{was passed by the}} Federal parliament and the law was not repealed until 1928.

5|$|The move of {{the company}} of the 45th Battalion down the exposed slope was disastrous, {{possibly}} as the company commander had not been advised of the particular difficulties involved. Moving in artillery formation, they were shelled and came under intense machine gun fire, suffering 11 killed and 37 wounded. The survivors scrambled to the embankment in small groups. Although the Official History is silent on <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> this debacle, in his notebooks, the Official Historian, Charles Bean, blamed Imlay.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
5|$|In spring 1933 Adolf Hitler {{started a}} {{campaign}} of discrimination and intimidation against Jews, depriving them of their property and citizenship.

In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took permanent residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.|$|E

5|$|Sir Edward's {{choice of}} {{architect}} is unknown, {{although it has}} been attributed to the mason William Arnold, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the designs of Cranborne Manor and Wadham College, Oxford, and had worked at Dunster Castle, also in Somerset. Dunster has architectural motifs similar to those found at Montacute. Phelips chose as the site for his new mansion a spot close by the existing house, built by his father. The date work commenced is undocumented, but is generally thought to be c.1598/9, based on dates on a fireplace and in stained glass within the house. The date 1601, engraved above a doorcase, is considered to be the date of completion.|$|E
5|$|Spending on Edward's {{personal}} household {{increased as}} he grew older, and in 1293 William of Blyborough took over as its administrator. Edward was probably given a religious education by the Dominican friars, whom his mother invited into his household in 1290. He was assigned one of his grandmother's followers, Guy Ferre, as his magister, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> his discipline, training him in riding and military skills. It is uncertain how well educated Edward was; {{there is little evidence}} for his ability to read and write, although his mother was keen that her other children were well educated, and Ferre was himself a relatively learned man for the period. Edward likely mainly spoke Anglo-Norman French in his daily life, in addition to some English and possibly Latin.|$|E
5|$|The Chancellor was {{effectively}} the first {{minister of the}} kingdom. His department, the chancery, {{was responsible for the}} Great Seal, which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. His key responsibility was to preside at meetings of the privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session. The second most prestigious office was the Secretary, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603. The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.|$|E
