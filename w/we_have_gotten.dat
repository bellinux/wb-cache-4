Nicholson told Louis Heyward, [...] "It {{is one of the}} best <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> from England. Everybody thinks this is about the best production in the Poe series for the past few years." [...] Arkoff noted that [...] "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture.

Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under Tony Dungy. During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: [...] "There was a certain brand of football you expected from us", Smith said. [...] "You know we would be relentless. There was a brand of football that you got from us each week at Raymond James Stadium. It was hard for opponents to come in and win. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> away from that a little bit, and it's time ... for us to become a relevant team again." ...|$|E

In the same 1906 issue, Grinnell commented on Thomas Harrison Montgomery's article questioning the scientific benefit of egg collection (Oology) in Audubon Society's Bird-Lore publication. Grinnell defends the collecting and study of birds' eggs in his editorial [...] "Is Egg-collecting Justifiable?" [...] and includes recreation {{as one of}} the values gained. [...] "Then there is the recreative phase which is not to be disparaged; and the pleasure to be derived from this pursuit.

It was also called [...] "their most sonically mature album to date." [...] and their best album since Clumsy by Circle 6 Magazine. At the time, the band praised their own efforts on the album. Duncan Coutts said in an interview, [...] "I {{think this is the}} closest we've ever come to {{achieving}} what we heard in our heads and got on (record). For us this is the most complete record, start to finish. Some of the other records had awesome moments, but I think this is as close as we feel <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> to getting a whole record exactly the way we wanted it." ...|$|E

[...] "We are likely to see more awards at a faster pace now that the program has been up and running and the tips <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> are leading to successful cases," [...] McKessy told the Wall Street Journal in June 2013.

60|$|I wish I {{could as}} easily remove that other {{difficulty}} which yet remains. It is objected {{by a great}} French critic {{as well as an}} admirable poet, yet living, and whom I have mentioned with that honour which his merit exacts from me (I mean, Boileau), that the machines of our Christian religion in heroic poetry are much more feeble to support that weight than those of heathenism. Their doctrine, grounded as it was on ridiculous fables, was yet the belief of the two victorious monarchies, the Grecian and Roman. Their gods did not only interest themselves in the event of wars (which is the effect of a superior Providence), but also espoused the several parties in a visible corporeal descent, managed their intrigues and fought their battles, sometimes in opposition to each other; though Virgil (more discreet than Homer in that last particular) has contented himself with the partiality of his deities, their favours, their counsels or commands, to those whose cause they had espoused, without bringing them to the outrageousness of blows. Now our religion, says he, is deprived of the greatest part of those machines--at least, the most shining in epic poetry. Though St. Michael in Ariosto seeks out Discord to send her amongst the Pagans, and finds her in a convent of friars, where peace should reign (which indeed is fine satire); and Satan in Tasso excites Soliman to an attempt by night on the Christian camp, and brings a host of devils to his assistance; yet the Archangel in the former example, when Discord was restive and would not be drawn from her beloved monastery with fair words, has the whip-hand of her, drags her out with many stripes, sets her on God's name about her business, and makes her know the difference of strength betwixt a nuncio of heaven and a minister of hell. The same angel in the latter instance from Tasso (as if God had never another messenger belonging to the court, but was confined, like Jupiter to Mercury, and Juno to Iris), when he sees his time--that is, when half of the Christians are already killed, and all the rest are in a fair way to be routed--stickles betwixt the remainders of God's host and the race of fiends, pulls the devils backward by the tails, and drives them from their quarry; or otherwise the whole business had miscarried, and Jerusalem remained untaken. This, says Boileau, is a very unequal match for the poor devils, who are sure to come by the worst of it in the combat; for nothing is more easy than for an Almighty Power to bring His old rebels to reason when He pleases. Consequently what pleasure, what entertainment, can be raised from so pitiful a machine, where we see the success of the battle {{from the very beginning of}} it? unless that as we are Christians, we are glad that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> God on our side to maul our enemies when we cannot do the work ourselves. For if the poet had given the faithful more courage, which had cost him nothing, or at least have made them exceed the Turks in number, he might have gained the victory for us Christians without interesting Heaven in the quarrel, and that with as much ease and as little credit to the conqueror as when a party of a hundred soldiers defeats another which consists only of fifty.|$|E
