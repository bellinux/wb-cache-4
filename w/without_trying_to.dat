5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E

25|$|The {{reported}} {{reasons for}} self-harm {{differ from the}} reasons for suicide attempts. Nearly 70% of people with BPD self-harm <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> end their life. Reasons for self-harm include expressing anger, self-punishment, generating normal feelings (often in response to dissociation), and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances. In contrast, suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others {{will be better off}} following the suicide. Both suicide and self-harm are a response to feeling negative emotions. Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{approach}} these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control seeks to reduce the heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} its closing, Alten, {{an owner of}} the club for 35 years, reminisced about the {{performers}} who brought the most guests to the club. [...] He named Gladys Knight & the Pips and Sam Cooke as the two acts who brought the most business into Club Harlem.

500|$|The Coens {{are known}} for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a {{relatively}} straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls [...] "a pretty savage film". Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.|$|E

500|$|Morris and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett {{rebuilt the}} innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes. They played sedately <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> take risks. Hassett fell after being beaten in flight by Young. [...] Aiming to break Young's {{restrictive}} leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Washbrook at wide mid-off. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps, with their personal tallies on 23 and 48 respectively. The run rate {{picked up in the}} last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time.|$|E

[...] While the tracks [...] "Don't Go Away" [...] and [...] "The Girl in the Dirty Shirt" [...] were described as unabashedly sentimental, Du Noyer went on to observe that [...] "there is compassion and sensitivity in these tracks that is not the work of oafs." [...] Du Noyer conceded that Noel often tied himself up in [...] "cosmic knots", but had [...] "written words that sound simple and true, and are therefore poetic <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] Lester read song titles such as [...] "Stand by Me" [...] and [...] "Don't Go Away" [...] as a series of demands, both to members of his private life and his public audience.|$|E
500|$|The order {{resulted}} {{in the death of}} both Waldmann and his wingman Schrey on the following mission. Waldmann was killed following a mid-air collision with Leutnant Hans-Dieter Weihs shortly after takeoff, and Schrey was killed in combat with US fighters. Mindful of the direct order of the Reichsmarschall, Oberleutnant Grünberg (1st Staffel), Oberleutnant Fritz Stehle (2nd Staffel) and Waldmann (3rd Staffel) had decided that each of them would lead a flight of four Me 262s, taking off and flying around for an hour before returning <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> engage the enemy. Grünberg's Schwarm took off first followed by Stehle's Schwarm. Waldmann chose Weihs, as the most experienced pilot trained in instrument flight, to lead the Schwarm, while Schrey once again served as Waldmann's wingman. Waldmann's Me 262 A-1 [...] "Yellow 3" [...] (Werknummer 117097—factory number) took off at 12:24 and Weihs ordered the Schwarm to form a close formation, flying wing tip to wing tip.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, stating that the band seemed more settled and comfortable while [...] "accentuating the big riffs and bigger emotions, crafting songs without a worry as to whether they're hip or not and, most importantly, enjoying the deep-rooted, nervy arena rock that is uniquely their own." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album four out of five stars, commenting that while [...] "some key sounds and sensibilities" [...] and uplifting lyrics were unlike Pearl Jam's earlier style, the music in Lightning Bolt marked a return to the [...] "thick-bottomed rhythms, hard-nosed guitars and darkened tone of classic Pearl Jam" [...] compared to predecessor Backspacer. Cole Waterman of PopMatters gave the album an eight out of ten, praising [...] "Pearl Jam thriving in their persona, building on what worked in the past <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> copy it while adding new elements to the mix" [...] and feeling that despite [...] "the closing songs get monotonous in their united balladry", [...] "Future Days" [...] was a good album closer, comparing it to Tom Waits.|$|E
