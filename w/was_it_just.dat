Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called the performance [...] "lovely", and Andrea Reiher for Zap2it similarly praised the piece: [...] "wow, she has a nice voice! She's no Julie Andrews, but she'll do." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented: [...] "Seeing Emma sing [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] was sweet, though <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> me (or my TV), or was the volume on her vocals a bit unusually loud? I also could have done without Will's line telling her she should sing to help her keep the beat as she danced – come on Glee, you're a musical. Embrace it and just let her sing." ...|$|E
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} July, Wilson {{left the}} film because of {{scheduling}} conflicts {{brought on by the}} filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script. Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would have been great to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it <b>was.</b> <b>It</b> <b>just</b> would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There was {{no basis}} here for {{criminal}} proceedings against Wright, {{but he had}} been publicly condemned as the man on whom the guilt chiefly lay, and that was a reputation that he was unlikely ever to live down. He retired to obscurity in Adelaide, leaving behind him still a slight, persistent mystery: why had he really delayed? [...] Was it only because {{he wanted to make sure}} of his salary? [...] Was it because he did not want to leave his wife and family and the comforts of the settled districts? [...] Was it merely that he was stupid, lazy and indifferent: a man too mean-spirited to think of anyone but himself? [...] Or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> possible that he was the victim of that same fated chain of errors that had bedevilled the expedition from the beginning? These were questions that would never be fully answered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opponents to {{the bill}} stood largely behind two {{different}} principles. Some of them, with Andrew Fisher being perhaps the best known, fully agreed about the danger threatening Australia if the war was lost, and with the consequent necessity of carrying on the war with the utmost power that could be developed. However, {{they believed that the}} best effort that could be mustered would be as a result of voluntary efforts only, and the effort to introduce conscription to a nation that did not feel directly threatened would only cause infighting and actually hamper the war effort. The other group of opponents, led by default by Frank Tudor and T. J. Ryan, argued that whilst it may be justifiable to compel men to do many things, compelling them to take life and risk their own came in a different category. Under no circumstances <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> to force a man to kill another man. The Australian Worker put this popular Labor Party platform thus: ...|$|E

She was rather confirmed in her belief that things did not stand being looked into.

More secretly than ever he put it back; {{and for the first time}} looked round. These people! They belonged to a world that he had left. They gave him the same feeling that her uncle and aunt had given him just now, when they said good-night, following her into their hotel. That good Colonel, that good Mrs. Ercott! The very concretion of the world he had been brought up in, of the English point of view; symbolic figures of health, reason, and the straight path, on which at that moment, seemingly, he had turned his back. The Colonel's profile, ruddy through its tan, with grey moustache guiltless of any wax, his cheery, high-pitched: [...] "Good-night, young Lennan!"
