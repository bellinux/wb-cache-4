5|$|During its {{development}} the ZNG experienced {{a number of}} problems, including shortages of weapons and ammunition, lack of uniforms, inadequate training and an overall deficiency in trained officers, and poor staff work and command structures (preventing the effective coordination of multiple units). These problems were offset by good morale, clear objectives {{and high levels of}} mobilisation. After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly <b>with</b> <b>arms</b> captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija). By the end of October 60 new brigades and independent battalions were established, and on 3 November the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background : Anorecta l {{malformation}} s (ARM) {{occur in}} 4 : 10000 newborn {{children with the}} gender distribut ion 1 : 1. 5 females:males. The reconstruction of ARM, posterior sagiccal anorectal plasty (PSARP), was implemenred worldwide in the late 1980 s and therefore the follow-ups are limited. Aims: To assess bowel symptoms {{in children and adolescents}} <b>with</b> <b>ARM,</b> operated on <b>with</b> PSARP, and to evaluate the qualicy oflife (QoL) and sexual health among the same adolescents. To evaluate the outcome of appendicostomy in preschool children <b>with</b> <b>ARM.</b> To study the anatomical status of the pelvic floor, and its possible correlation with bowel symptoms, among females <b>with</b> <b>ARM.</b> Results: Fecal incontinence was reported by 45 % of the 121 children, and by 75 % of the 24 adolescents. Constipation was reported by 50 % children and 83 % adolescents. Symptoms were more frequenr among females than males with the same subcype of ARM. Physically related QoL was lowered for females <b>with</b> <b>ARM,</b> while the mental domains in QoL were higher for the males <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> compared <b>with</b> healthy conrrols. Jnrimate situations were influen ced by gas and fecal incontinence for both genders. Appendico stomy in 17 preschool children <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> improved the fecal continence significand y, but 43 % had minor complications. All 17 females <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> examined <b>with</b> perineal ultrasonograph y had multiple defects on the anal sphincter, withour correlation with the degree of bowel symptom s. Conclusion: Bowcl symptoms in chi ldren and adolcscenrs <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> arc considerable and gender differen ces arc present. "fhe QoL and sexual health are i nAuenced both by gas and feca l incontin ence, and by self-efficacy, so directed psychological support could be valuable. Appendicostomy in preschool children is successful and wi ll be continued. Al l pregnant females <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> should preferab ly be recommended to deliver by cesarian section...|$|R

5|$|In December 1994, Croatia and the RSK made an {{economic}} agreement to restore road and rail links, water and gas supplies, {{and use of}} {{a part of the}} Adria oil pipeline. Even though some of the agreement was never implemented, a section of the ZagrebBelgrade motorway passing through RSK territory near Okučani and the pipeline were both opened. Following a deadly incident that occurred in late April 1995 on the recently opened motorway, Croatia reclaimed all of the RSK's territory in western Slavonia during Operation Flash, taking full control of the territory by 4 May, three days after the battle began. In response, the ARSK attacked Zagreb using M-87 Orkan missiles with cluster munitions. Subsequently, Milošević sent a senior Yugoslav Army officer to command the ARSK, along <b>with</b> <b>arms,</b> field officers and thousands of Serbs born in the RSK area who had been forcibly conscripted by the ARSK.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{studies of}} the mummy were first thought to reveal {{a man in his}} 50s, but {{subsequent}} examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of orthodontics, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also {{different from that of the}} female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed <b>with</b> <b>arms</b> crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Quality of life (QOL) is an {{important}} endpoint in health outcomes research, especially in pediatric chronic conditions. While some studies suggest that patients <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> report {{a lower level of}} physical and psychosocial QOL, as compared to healthy peers, not all research shows this consistently. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the QOL of Italian children and adolescents <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> to the QOL of a large control sample of healthy peers. METHOD: Parents of 109 children <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> and 336 schoolchildren, completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Analysis of variances were used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Compared to healthy peers, children <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> showed lower emotional functioning (F = 8, 41; p =. 004), social functioning (F = 4, 9; p =. 027) and school functioning (F = 14, 7; p =. 000). In the adolescent group, females had a worse QOL in the physical functioning domain (F = 5, 01; p =. 03) than males, independent of group membership. CONCLUSIONS: While children <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> show a more impaired QOL compared to their peers, this difference does not emerge in the adolescent group. Our results are consistent with previous findings which hypothesize that while patients <b>with</b> <b>ARM</b> face more difficulties during childhood, by adolescence they may have learned to overcome these difficultie...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Brazil, now {{ascendant}} under Emperor Dom PedroII, provided {{support to}} the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, {{as well as to}} the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. <b>With</b> <b>arms</b> and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported <b>with</b> <b>arms</b> and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered {{heavy losses}} and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{incompletion}} on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker {{on the left side}} of the line of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood <b>with</b> <b>arms</b> akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E
