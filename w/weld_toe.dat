In this paper, the residual stress distribution both near the surface and in depth around the <b>weld</b> <b>toe</b> was investigated using neutron diffraction, complemented with X-ray diffraction. Measurements were done on a 1300 MPa yield strength steel welded using a Low Transformation Temperature (LTT) consumable. Near surface residual stresses, as close as 39 µm below the surface, were measured using neutron diffraction and evaluated by applying a near surface data correction technique. Very steep surface stress gradients within 0. 5 mm of the surface were found both at the <b>weld</b> <b>toe</b> and 2 mm into the heat affected zone (HAZ).

40|$|Abstract. Based on the FEM {{analysis}} of the distributions and varieties of the stresses and the strains of the large-size dissimilar steel welded tube-plate structure under cyclic loading, the fatigue crack initiation sites of this structure were predicted. The low-cycle fatigue test was performed to verify the prediction and to study the cracks propagating paths as well. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> linked to the two surfaces of the plate were the positions with the peak values of the maximum stress and the stress amplitude. The plastic deformations in the first loading cycle introduced the tensile-compressive repeated stress cycle at the <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> during the subsequent loading cycles. It induced the fatigue cracks initiating at the <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> linked to the two surfaces of the plate respectively.

Fatigue design of these joints is not available in current standards. An understanding of the stress concentrations and failure in these connections is therefore necessary as a step towards understanding the fatigue behaviour of these connections. Stress concentration factors (SCFs) of welded thin-walled (t< 4 mm) circular hollow section (CHS) -to-plate T-joints are determined at different locations along the <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> on the tubular brace. The distribution of SCFs along the <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> shows that the highest SCF occurs at the <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> in the circular brace at the 0 o line. The ratio of the end of test fatigue life (N 4) to the through thickness fatigue life (N 3) in the thin CHS-Plate T-joints is found to fall within the range of N 4 /N 3 found in previous research of both thick and thin-walled joints. Surface crack growth monitoring is used to obtain an approximation of the length of surface crack at the point of occurrence of a through thickness crack.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to evaluate the fatigue strength of welded diaphragm-to-beam connections. Experimental tests were performed {{in order to determine}} the fatigue resistance of the detail, examine failure modes, and to evaluate repair methods. Two diaphragm configurations were studied: one with diaphragms positioned back-to-back and one with staggered diaphragms. The experimental results indicate that the back-to-back diaphragms distribute load laterally more than the staggered diaphragms. The back-to-back configuration provides stiffness to the beam web and acts as a continuous transverse member. Because of the stiffness, many of the web and flange welds connecting the diaphragm to the beam fractured for the non-staggered diaphragms that resulted in decreased load transfer. Horizontal cracking also developed in the beam webs but did not affect the fatigue strength of the beam. The staggered diaphragms do not stiffen the beam web, but pull the beam web out-of-plane causing high out-of-plane bending stresses to develop. In the staggered diaphragm tests, cracks perpendicular to the stress field developed in the beam webs at the toe of a bottom flange weld. However, the beams did not fracture immediately. The repair methods investigated were removing the diaphragm and drilling holes at the beam crack tips, removing the diaphragm and peening the bottom flange <b>weld</b> <b>toes,</b> and leaving the diaphragm in place and peening the bottom flange <b>weld</b> <b>toes.</b> Peening the bottom flange <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> before fatigue cracks developed did prevent cracks from forming for both diaphragm configurations. When a crack was present in the beam web, drilling holes at the crack tips arrested the crack growth. Finite element models of the welded diaphragm-to-beam connection were developed {{in order to determine the}} stresses near the welds. The stresses were then used in a crack propagation model that predicts the fatigue life of cracked beam members that have the welded diaphragm connection. Based upon the experimental and analytical results, it has been shown that beam members that develop cracks have a long fatigue life. Also, repair methods are effective in extending the fatigue life of a beam member once cracks develop and before the onset of cracks. ...|$|R

To provide an overview of the different fatigue calculation methods, a comparison study was performed, as well as a local weld parameter study for two typical fillet welded joints. The two methods used for this study were the structural hot spot and effective notch stress method. Two fillet welded joints were provided by Aker Solutions MMO AS, Bergen, Norway. The first joint is a rectangular hollow section from a davit, built as a truss. The second model is a part of a K-joint from a semi-submersible (Aker H 3 design).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the fatigue strength of several details commonly found in steel bridges in Indiana that contain intersecting welds. Large-scale experimental fatigue testing were performed using nine steel beams to study the behavior of three basic types of welded details: a vertical stiffener, a horizontal stiffener terminating near a vertical stiffener, and a horizontal gusset plate coped to fit around a vertical stiffener. The welded details in this study were fabricated with varying degrees of web gap, defined as the distance between perpendicular <b>weld</b> <b>toes.</b> The results of the experimental testing were examined and compared to prior testing to determine if the size of the web gap affected the fatigue strength. Furthermore, the performance of drilled hole retrofits used to extend the fatigue life of these details was studied.

However, the size of the web gap may have had an effect on the fatigue strength of details where a horizontal stiffener terminated near a vertical stiffener. Further experimental testing is needed to more clearly define the relationship between web gap and fatigue strength for this case.

The hypothesis of the equivalent effective stress (EES), which is based on local coordinate stresses in <b>weld</b> <b>toes</b> and considers the maximum stressed material volume governed by the stress gradient and the phase displacement between the local normal and shear stresses, transferred local multiaxial stress states for different load conditions with constant or changing principal stress directions into particular equivalent stresses. These values fitted fairly well into the particular local S-N curve determined under uniaxial load of the investigated welded flange-tube and tube-tube connections from the structural steel StE 460...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic peening {{treatment}} (UPT) as {{a method}} of severe plastic deformation was used to treat cruciform welded joints of Q 345 steel. The application of UPT achieves material surface nanocrystallization of the peening zone, reduces stress concentration, and produces residual compressive stresses at the <b>welded</b> <b>toe.</b> Micro-structure, hardness, stress relief, S-N curve, and the fatigue fracture mechanism of cruciform welded joint of Q 345 steel, both before and after UPT, were analyzed in detail. The main results show that: stress concentration and residual tensile stress are the main reasons to reduce fatigue strength of cruciform welded joints. The fatigue life of cruciform welded joints is improved for surface hardening, compressive stress, and grain refinement by UPT. Residual compressive stress caused by UPT is released with the increase of fatigue life. A very significant fatigue strength improvement happens when UPT is replenished repeatedly after a certain number of cycles...|$|R
