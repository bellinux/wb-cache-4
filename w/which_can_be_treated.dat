5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> {{with a variety of}} methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

25|$|Scleroderma can {{decrease}} motility {{anywhere in}} the gastrointestinal tract. The most common source of decreased motility is the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to dysphagia and chest pain. As scleroderma progresses, esophageal involvement from abnormalities in decreased motility may worsen due to progressive fibrosis (scarring). If this is left untreated, acid from the stomach can back up into the esophagus, causing esophagitis and GERD. Further scarring from acid damage to the lower esophagus many times leads {{to the development of}} fibrotic narrowing, also known as strictures <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> by dilatation, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{for study}} of non-equilibrium {{processes}} mostly deal with spatially continuous flow systems. In this case, the open connection between system and surroundings is usually taken to fully surround the system, {{so that there}} are no separate connections impermeable to matter but permeable to heat. Except for the special case mentioned above when there is no actual transfer of matter, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as if for a closed system, in strictly defined thermodynamic terms, it follows that transfer of energy as heat is not defined. In this sense, {{there is no such thing}} as 'heat flow' for a continuous-flow open system. Properly, for closed systems, one speaks of transfer of internal energy as heat, but in general, for open systems, one can speak safely only of transfer of internal energy. A factor here is that there are often cross-effects between distinct transfers, for example that transfer of one substance may cause transfer of another even when the latter has zero chemical potential gradient.|$|E
25|$|Blowfly strike, or flystrike is {{a serious}} welfare problem in the animal industry. This {{cutaneous}} myiasis or infestation not only causes severe discomfort or stress to the animal, but will also cause death when left untreated. Ewe lambs and female sheep are primarily affected and are struck predominately in the rear quadrant of the animal due to fecal staining. Due to the difficulty in controlling these flies, there are considerable losses in the sheep industry every year. Also, there is an increasing concern of the insecticidal use and the surgical procedures done to control L. cuprina, making this not only an animal welfare issue but also an economical one. The maggots of L. cuprina rapidly grow while eating the living flesh of the sheep while secreting ammonia, thus, poisoning the sheep. Sheep show signs of skin irritation by rubbing and biting the affected areas {{during the first few}} days after the eggs have been laid. This causes an inflammatory response in the sheep resulting in severe irritation and pyrexia. Once a flystrike has started other flies are attracted to the site. Although treatment is available, the delayed response time due to symptoms allows wool breakage in the affected area and fleece to be tender overall. There are many predispositions to the flystrike that make a host more favorable, including an infection with dermatophilosis and footrot, both of <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> and prevented. In some animals a weak resistance can develop, but this immune response is often associated with a decrease in productivity which is an undesirable trait.|$|E

2500|$|The Fourier {{transform}} can be formally {{defined as}} an improper Riemann integral, making it an integral transform, although this definition is not suitable for many applications requiring a more sophisticated integration theory. For example, many relatively simple applications use the Dirac delta function, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> formally {{as if it were}} a function, but the justification requires a mathematically more sophisticated viewpoint. The Fourier transform can also be generalized to functions of several variables on Euclidean space, sending a function of [...] space to a function of [...] momentum (or a function of space and time to a function of 4-momentum). This idea makes the spatial Fourier transform very natural in the study of waves, as well as in quantum mechanics, where it is important to be able to represent wave solutions as functions of either space or momentum and sometimes both. In general, functions to which Fourier methods are applicable are complex-valued, and possibly vector-valued. Still further generalization is possible to functions on groups, which, besides the original Fourier transform on [...] or [...] (viewed as groups under addition), notably includes the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT, group = [...] ), the discrete Fourier transform (DFT, group = [...] ) and the Fourier series or circular Fourier transform (group = , the unit circle ‚âà closed finite interval with endpoints identified). The latter is routinely employed to handle periodic functions. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm for computing the DFT.|$|E
6000|$|... ¬ß 3. Of {{these laws}} or uniformities, the most {{comprehensive}} are those supplied by mathematics; the axioms relating to equality, inequality, and proportionality, and the various theorems thereon founded. And these are the only Laws of Resemblance which require to be, or <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be,</b> <b>treated</b> apart. It is true there are innumerable other theorems which affirm resemblances among phenomena; as that {{the angle of the}} reflection of light is equal to its angle of incidence (equality being merely exact resemblance in magnitude). Again, that the heavenly bodies describe equal areas in equal times; and that their periods of revolution are proportional (another species of resemblance) to the sesquiplicate powers of their distances from the centre of force. These and similar propositions affirm resemblances, of the same nature with those asserted in the theorems of mathematics; but the distinction is, that the propositions of mathematics are true of all phenomena whatever, or at least without distinction of origin; while the truths in question are affirmed only of special phenomena, which originate in a certain way; and the equalities, proportionalities, or other resemblances, which exist between such phenomena, must necessarily be either derived from, or identical with, the law of their origin‚Äîthe law of causation on which they depend. The equality of the areas described in equal times by the planets, is derived from the laws of the causes; and, until its derivation was shown, it was an empirical law. The equality of the angles of reflection and incidence is identical with the law of the cause; for the cause is the incidence of a ray of light upon a reflecting surface, and the equality in question is the very law according to which that cause produces its effects. This class, therefore, of the uniformities of resemblance between phenomena, are inseparable, in fact and in thought, from the laws of the production of those phenomena; and the principles of induction applicable to them are no other than those of which we have treated in the preceding chapters of this Book.|$|E
