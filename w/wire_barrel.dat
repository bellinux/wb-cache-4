50|$|Crimp Contact is a {{connector}} {{pin or socket}} whose back portion (<b>wire</b> <b>barrel)</b> is a hollow cylinder into which a stripped wire (conductor) is inserted. The sidewalls of the <b>wire</b> <b>barrel</b> are then mechanically compressed (uniformly deformed) using a crimping tool to captivate the conductor..|$|E
5000|$|Solder Contact is a pin or {{socket contact}} that accepts a {{conductor}} (wire) which is soldered onto the [...] "solder cup," [...] not crimped into the <b>wire</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Simpler to {{automate}} since wire can be {{laid in the}} un-crimped connector versus barrel which requires funneling the <b>wire</b> into the <b>barrel</b> to prevent strands from catching.|$|R
50|$|The APB (Avtomaticheskij Pistolet Besshumnyj, meaning {{automatic}} silenced pistol) {{version was}} {{a version of}} the APS optimized for silent operations. Developed in the early 1970s by A.S. Neugodov (А.С. Неугодов) under the factory name AO-44, it was officially adopted in 1972 under the service name APB and given GRAU index 6P13. Approximately 2000 APS pistols were converted to APB variants by the Vyatskie Polyansky Machine-Building Plant from 1972 to 1973. Muzzle velocity reportedly dropped to 290 m/s in this variant. Instead of the holster-stock of the APS, the APB comes with a detachable stock made of steel <b>wire.</b> Its <b>barrel</b> is longer than that of the APS; it protrudes from the slide and is threaded for the attachment of an eccentric sound suppressor. The barrel itself is also wrapped around by an integrated expansion chamber, in which gasses escape from holes in the barrel. When not in use, the detachable sound suppressor can be clipped to the stock.|$|R
