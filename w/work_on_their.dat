5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a {{problematic}} {{period for the}} Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, many of its productions were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s to <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> licensing agreements, but {{he was unable to}} compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.|$|E

The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} a North American tour supporting {{one of their}} main influences, Yes, in summer 2004, Dream Theater took a two-month break.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to {{be closer}} to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas {{on the way back to}} Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E
