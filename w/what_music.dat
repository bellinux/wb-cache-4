For the choreography, which encompassed all the stages present, Jackson had to employ a different approach, so that the audience could see the performance from every angle.|$|E

Malay popular {{music is a}} combination of the music from all ethnicities in the country. The Malaysian government has taken steps in controlling <b>what</b> <b>music</b> is available in Malaysia; rap music has been criticised, heavy metal has been limited, and foreign bands must submit a copy of a recent concert before playing in Malaysia. It is believed that this music is a bad influence on youth.|$|E

25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music.

It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

The vocals and Barham's contribution, along with a brief slide-guitar commentary from Harrison over the final verse, were overdubbed at Trident Studios, most likely during late August through September. Dated 19 August, Spector's written comments on Harrison's early mix of the song had suggested a [...] "proper background voice" [...] was still needed; like sound engineer Ken Scott, Spector would be impressed with the result, saying, [...] "He was a great harmoniser... he could do all the [...] parts himself" [...] and rating Harrison [...] "one of the most commercial musicians and songwriters and quintessential players I've ever known in my entire career".|$|E

He built each cue around [...] "small, endlessly repeating phrases"—often, the only variety through a [...] "thinning of the texture for eight bars". The percussion instruments included tablas, bongos, cymbals, piano, xylophones, and marimbas; also featured were guitars, flute, and world music instruments.
