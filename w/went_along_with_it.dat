25|$|Uniting with Van Dorn at Ripley, Mississippi on September 28, Price placed {{himself under}} Van Dorn's command. The Army of the West was redesignated Price's Corps, which with Mansfield Lovell's {{division}} from the District of the Mississippi, formed Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee. (Lovell's division remained separate from Price's corps and reported directly to Van Dorn.) Van Dorn then informed Price of {{his plans to}} capture Corinth: first the Confederates would march to Pocahontas, northwest of Corinth, in order to confuse the Union high command, {{then turn around and}} attack Corinth from the north and northwest. Although opposed to the plan, Price <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> During the two‑day Battle of Corinth, Price's corps did much of the fighting. On the first day, Price's troops drove the Union troops from their lines north of Corinth into their second line of fortifications; on the second, his divisions overran several parts of the Union line and briefly entered into Corinth but had to fall back due to lack of support. Hebert reported himself sick {{on the morning of the}} second day and was replaced by Brigadier General Martin E. Green; in addition, several field officers were killed or wounded during the battle. During both days, Lovell failed to fully support Price's attacks, which may have been due to his opposition to attacking Corinth at all.|$|E
500|$|On 31 October 1961, Polydor {{released}} [...] "My Bonnie" [...] (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur) {{which appeared}} on the West German charts under the name [...] "Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers"—a generic name used for whoever {{happened to be in}} Sheridan's backup group, although McCartney explained: [...] "They didn't like our name and said, 'Change to the Beat Brothers, this is more understandable for the German audience.' We <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it...</b> it was a record." [...] The song was later released in the UK, on 5 January 1962. A few copies were also pressed under the American Decca Records label.|$|E
500|$|The {{father of}} the twenty-cent piece was Nevada Senator John P. Jones. [...] Part-owner of the Crown Point Mine, he had been elected to the Senate in 1873; on February 10, 1874, he {{introduced}} a bill to authorize a twenty-cent piece, {{one of his first}} legislative endeavors. [...] In advocating for the proposal, he cited the lack of small change in the West. It was endorsed by mint director Linderman; according to numismatic historian Walter Breen, [...] "other legislators <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> largely as a favor to Sen. Jones". The bill was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 3, 1875. Like other denominations of silver coin, the twenty-cent piece was made legal tender up to five dollars.|$|E

500|$|Landy was {{initially}} hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife Marilyn in 1975. Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, {{saying that the}} only reason that he <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> was so {{that he would not be}} committed to a psychiatric facility. Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group. During the recording of 15 Big Ones (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours. Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income. At the command of Landy, Wilson appeared on Saturday Night Live, choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] which received mixed feedback. Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read [...] "smile". He said that critics misapprehended his motives, elaborating that Wilson's performance [...] "was a terrible thing" [...] as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances, then he would have gradually overcome his stage fright.|$|E
500|$|When {{inventory}} returns {{exposed a}} dangerous shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. British arsenals were raided (including {{some in the}} West Indies) and some manufacturing was attempted; a barely adequate supply (about 2.5 million pounds) was obtained {{by the end of}} 1776, mostly from France. [...] In search of heavy weapons, he sent Henry Knox on an expedition to Fort Ticonderoga to retrieve cannons that had been captured there. [...] He resisted repeated calls from Congress to launch attacks against the British in Boston, calling war councils that supported the decisions against such action. [...] Before the Continental Navy was established in November 1775 he, without Congressional authorization, began arming a [...] "secret navy" [...] to prey on poorly protected British transports and supply ships. [...] When Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec, believing that province's people would also rise against British military control, Washington reluctantly <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> even authorizing Benedict Arnold to lead a force from Cambridge to Quebec City through the wilderness of present-day Maine.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a member}} of the National Wrestling Alliance, Rickard was {{involved}} in arranging title defences in the Australasian region for NWA World champions during the 1970s and 80s. He was responsible for the unsanctioned title switch between Ric Flair and Harley Race at the Wellington Town Hall on 21 March 1984, and in Geylang, Singapore three days later. Race, who had been friends with Rickard for many years, agreed to this in an attempt to help revive wrestling in Australasia then in decline. Flair also <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> later commenting [...] "If Harley Race OK'd it, it was hard for anyone to tell them different". It has been worked out a [...] "backroom deal", mostly to keep it a secret from wrestling [...] "dirt sheets" [...] such as the Wrestling Observer, however the NWA objected to being left out of the planning and refused to recognize these title changes for several years.|$|E

2500|$|While {{many were}} {{concerned}} about the public image and embarrassment that <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> the global concern of HIV/AIDS became more prevalent, a growing suspicion of the activities that took place in. The HIV scare in Singapore can draw parallels with the English Syphilis scare. Bugis Street was demolished as a way of not only controlling the population to become more orderly and normative, but also to prevent an HIV epidemic. With fears also being present that through homosexuality, the society and culture would denigrate and would limit the island's growth, especially post independence. By allowing a site like Bugis Street would go against the idea of Singapore's nuclear family and is therefore [...] "othered" [...] this othering scares the Singaporean authorities as it can be seen as descenting. By using an HIV scare and the economic benefits of inputing an MRT station and eventually a mall, the amount of resistance from most Singaporeans would be minimal.|$|E
2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E

60|$|Sect. 222. The {{reason why}} men enter into society, is the {{preservation}} of their property; and the end why they chuse and authorize a legislative, is, {{that there may be}} laws made, and rules set, as guards and fences to the properties of {{all the members of the}} society, to limit the power, and moderate the dominion, of every part and member of the society: for since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society, that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure, by entering into society, and for which the people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making; whenever the legislators endeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence. Whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavour to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to resume their original liberty, and, by the establishment of a new legislative, (such as they shall think fit) provide for their own safety and security, which is the end for which they are in society. What I have said here, concerning the legislative in general, holds true also concerning the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him, both to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society. He acts also contrary to his trust, when he either employs the force, treasure, and offices of the society, to corrupt the representatives, and gain them to his purposes; or openly preengages the electors, and prescribes to their choice, such, whom he has, by sollicitations, threats, promises, or otherwise, won to his designs; and employs them to bring in such, who have promised before-hand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate candidates and electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it but to cut up the government by the roots, and poison the very fountain of public security? for the people having reserved to themselves the choice of their representatives, as the fence to their properties, could do it for no other end, but that they might always be freely chosen, and so chosen, freely act, and advise, as the necessity of the commonwealth, and the public good should, upon examination, and mature debate, be judged to require. This, those who give their votes before they hear the debate, and have weighed the reasons on all sides, are not capable of doing. To prepare such an assembly as this, and endeavour to set up the declared abettors of his own will, for the true representatives of the people, and the law-makers of the society, is certainly as great a breach of trust, and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government, as is possible to be met with. To which, if one shall add rewards and punishments visibly employed to the same end, and all the arts of perverted law made use of, to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design, and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country, it will be past doubt what is doing. What power they ought to have in the society, who thus employ it contrary to the trust <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> in its first institution, is easy to determine; and one cannot but see, that he, who has once attempted any such thing as this, cannot any longer be trusted.|$|E
