Even in lackluster films, however, he nevertheless often {{succeeded in making}} art of <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> hackwork. Still, for all his tireless work in the studios, Manne's labor of love was his contribution to jazz as an American art form, {{to which he had}} dedicated himself since his youth and continued to work at almost to the last day of his life.|$|E

This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> evolutionary cytology.|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s, {{he wrote}} humorous commentaries for {{national}} magazines. His radio career gained an early-1980s revival {{in his native}} New York City, thanks to his two-and-a-half-minute The Henry Morgan Show commentaries, broadcast twice daily on WNEW-AM (now WBBR) starting in January 1981. The following year, he added the Saturday evening show Morgan and the Media on WOR. In <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> inadvertent iconoclasm, Morgan used a 1981 WNEW commentary on pre-inflation prices to sing, rather wistfully, an old Pepsi jingle ("Pepsi-Cola hits the spot/Twelve full ounces, that's a lot/Twice as much for a nickel, too/Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you"). The irony abounded as well, remembering Morgan's controversies with his sponsors in the classic radio days; the only thing wrong with singing that ancient Pepsi jingle was that that day's Morgan commentary was sponsored by rival Coca-Cola.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, two young Irish poets, Michael Smith (born 1942) and Trevor Joyce (born 1947) founded the New Writers Press {{publishing}} {{house and a}} journal called The Lace Curtain. Initially this was to publish their own work and that of some like-minded friends (including Paul Durcan, Michael Hartnett and Gerry Smyth), and later to promote the work of neglected Irish modernists like Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin. Both Joyce and Smith have published considerable bodies of poetry in their own right. Among the other poets published by the New Writers Press were Geoffrey Squires (born 1942), whose early work was influenced by Charles Olson, and Augustus Young (born 1943), who admired Pound and who has translated older Irish poetry, as well as work from Latin America and poems by Bertolt Brecht. Younger poets who write <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> experimental poetry include Maurice Scully (born 1952), and Randolph Healy (born 1956). Many of these poets along with many younger experimentalists have performed their work at the annual SoundEye Festival in Cork, which has been recognised as an important event not just for Irish poetry, but for innovative work internationally.|$|E

Beiderbecke [...] "lived very briefly [...] in <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the servants' entrance to art," [...] Ferguson wrote. [...] "His story is a good story, quite humble and right."

500|$|The size of Eta Carinae A is {{not even}} well defined. It has an {{optically}} dense stellar wind so the typical definition of a star's surface being approximately where it becomes opaque gives a very different result to where a more traditional definition of a surface might be.

500|$|While {{a student}} at the University of Vienna in 1913-14, Moreno {{gathered}} a group of prostitutes as a way of discussing the social stigma and other problems they faced, starting <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the first [...] "support group". [...] From experiences like that, and as inspired by psychoanalysts such as Wilhelm Reich and Freud, Moreno began to develop psychodrama. After moving to the United States in 1925, Moreno introduced his work with psychodrama to American psychologists. [...] He began this work with children, and then eventually moved on to large group psychodrama sessions that he held at Impromptu Group Theatre at Carnegie Hall. These sessions established Moreno's name, not only in psychological circles, but also among non-psychologists. [...] Moreno continued to teach his method of psychodrama, leading sessions until his death in 1974.|$|E

500|$|Manning's first post-war novel, Artist Among the Missing, an evocative {{account of}} life in the Middle East, was {{published}} in 1949, and received mixed reviews. She worked on an Irish travel book, The Dreaming Shore, which drew on her Anglo-Irish upbringing, but proved [...] "a millstone" [...] as it required multiple expensive journeys to Ireland. The book was notable for her view that Ireland would one day be united. Manning continued the series of publications with School for Love, published in 1951. The novel concerned a boy growing up in Palestine during the Second World War. With its publication, Reggie, on whom Manning relied heavily for literary judgment, help and support, boasted that [...] "My Olivia is <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> an established author". The novel was generally well-received, but faced the possibility of a libel suit from Clarissa Graves, sister of Robert on whom Miss Bohun, one of the novel's characters, may have been based.|$|E
