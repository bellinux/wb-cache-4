50|$|Flindersia collina is an Australian {{rainforest}} tree in {{the citrus}} family. It {{is known as the}} <b>Leopard</b> <b>Wood,</b> Broad-leaved <b>Leopard</b> Tree or Leopard Ash. It occurs in dry rainforest, often on hillsides. The species name collina means hill dweller. Seen from the upper Richmond River, New South Wales to Cape Melville in tropical Queensland. An attractive tree with pleasantly marked bark, and shapely notched leaflets.|$|R
50|$|OthersThe South Branch in Smoke Hole {{is home to}} rainbow trout, {{black and}} rock bass and other sunfish as well as eels. A variety of frogs include the <b>wood,</b> bronze, <b>leopard,</b> and green frog, along with spring peepers.|$|R
50|$|Designed to {{resemble}} a snarling leopard, this wooden mask is heavily adorned {{with a variety of}} materials to include pigment, shells, cloth, fiber, fur, paper, metal, feathers, and quills. This mask is denoted as male by the cartridge shells along the top and the <b>wood</b> carved <b>leopard's</b> teeth placed along the sides and bottom.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} species of {{reptiles}} and amphibians that call the refuge home including the northern water, garter and Northern brown snakes; pickerel, <b>wood</b> and southern <b>leopard</b> frogs (the latter listed as endangered in Pennsylvania) and the state threatened American red-bellied turtle {{as well as the}} painted, snapping and eastern box turtles.|$|R
25|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{include the}} snapping, spotted, wood, blanding's, and painted turtle, American toad, spring peeper, and the gray tree, striped chorus, bull, green, mink, <b>wood,</b> pickerel, and <b>leopard</b> frog. There are no poisonous snakes in Haliburton, {{but there are}} the following non-poisonous snakes: common garter, common water, brown, eastern ribbon, hognose, eastern ringneck, smooth green, milk, and red-bellied.|$|R

5000|$|The {{northern}} {{portions of}} the wetland are interspersed with forested gneiss ridges, while the southern and eastern portions are flat and underlain by clay sediments deposited by the post glacial Champlain Sea. The old shoreline of the Champlain Sea meanders from Blue Heron Road in the north-east to Innisville in the south-west. The approximate contour for this shoreline is 155 to 150m. Along this elevation, the clay deposits of the Champlain Sea abut exposed gneiss. A series of seepage areas, springs and small streams are scattered along this contact line. Noteworthy breeding birds include osprey, great blue herons and turkey vultures. The larger ponds provide migratory resting areas for ducks, particularly wood ducks, hooded mergansers and ring-necked ducks. There are healthy populations of at least eight species of frogs: <b>wood</b> frogs, <b>leopard</b> frogs, spring peepers, American toads, gray treefrogs, mink frogs, green frogs and bull frogs. There are also three species of salamanders: spotted, blue-spotted and red-backed. Three species of turtles are known from the wetland: painted turtles, snapping turtles and Blanding’s turtles. Wetland mammals include otters, muskrats, beavers and ermine. [...] There is a typical wetland flora. Some significant plant species include a population of green arrow arum growing at the extreme northern limit of its range in North America, and a population of an uncommon orchid, downy rattlesnake plantain. Part of the wetland and adjoining forest is protected by the Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust as the Keddy Nature Sanctuary.|$|R
5000|$|The {{property}} {{has more}} than ten ponds, and these in turn are interconnected by seepage areas and vernal pools left by melting snow in the spring. There are healthy populations of at least eight species of frogs: <b>wood</b> frogs, <b>leopard</b> frogs, spring peepers, American toads, gray treefrogs, mink frogs, green frogs and bull frogs. [...] The earliest to call each year are usually wood frogs and spring peepers, often when ponds still have areas of ice. Wood frogs are rapid breeders in small temporary ponds, also known as vernal ponds; mating and egg laying are completed {{in just a few}} days. Gray Tree frogs, on the other hand, have a much longer calling period. They call from the trees before moving to water, they call from the water while mating, and then they call while leaving the pond for the forest. Bullfrogs are the last to call, usually during the hot evenings of July and August. Other amphibians include spotted, blue spotted and red-backed salamanders. There are also populations of snapping turtles and painted turtles, with recorded sightings of Blanding’s turtles; several south-facing slopes are actively used by nesting turtles. As noted above, there are frequent sightings of wetland mammals including otters, muskrat, beavers and ermine. There is a rich wetland flora typical of ponds on the Canadian shield, such as yellow water lilies and water shield. There are also less-common species including green arrow arum [...] and purple-fringed orchid. There is one known species of a carnivorous plant, horned bladderwort. There are also large clones of semi-aquatic sedges that support populations of two rare butterflies, the broad winged skipper and the Appalachian brown.|$|R
50|$|The boreal forest, or taiga, {{supports}} {{a relatively small}} range of animals due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects. Insects {{play a critical role}} as pollinators, decomposers, and {{as a part of the}} food web. Many nesting birds rely on them for food in the summer months. The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging biome for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures, and there are only a few species in the boreal forest including red-sided garter snake, common European adder, blue-spotted salamander, northern two-lined salamander, Siberian salamander, <b>wood</b> frog, northern <b>leopard</b> frog, boreal chorus frog, American toad, and Canadian toad. Most hibernate underground in winter. Fish of the taiga must be able to withstand cold water conditions and be able to adapt to life under ice-covered water. Species in the taiga include Alaska blackfish, northern pike, walleye, longnose sucker, white sucker, various species of cisco, lake whitefish, round whitefish, pygmy whitefish, Arctic lamprey, various grayling species, brook trout (including sea-run brook trout in the Hudson Bay area), chum salmon, Siberian taimen, lenok and lake chub.|$|R
