This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw.

Removal of a <b>wire</b> rope <b>termination</b> for repair or replacement requires separation of the wedge and socket that lock together to secure the rope end. The Bureau investigated currently used methods and improved upon and tested two safer alternate methods for removing <b>wire</b> rope <b>terminations.</b> A cannon test program was conducted, using 40 -and 50 -gr primer (detonating) cord, to establish the possible force produced with a 4 -in-bore cannon and a 55 -lb projectile. Wedge and socket units supplied from cooperating mines were separated under controlled conditions to establish data on separation force requirements. The two alternate methods investigated were use of the force generated by (1) a pendulum ram and by (2) a portable hydraulic pusher.

40|$|We conceptually {{unify the}} {{description}} of resonances existing at metallic nanoparticles and optical nanowire antennas. To this end the nanoantenna is treated as a Fabry-Perot resonator with arbitrary semi-nanoparticles forming the terminations. We show that the frequencies of the quasi-static dipolar resonances of these nanoparticles coincide with the frequency where the phase of the complex reflection coefficient of the fundamental propagating plasmon polariton mode at the <b>wire</b> <b>termination</b> amounts to π. The lowest order Fabry-Perot resonance of the optical wire antenna occurs therefore even for a negligible wire length.

50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the <b>terminations</b> of aluminum <b>wire</b> circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper <b>wire</b> <b>terminations</b> inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R

Threaded Studs, Ferrules, Sockets, and Sleeves are a few examples. [...] Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.|$|R

5000|$|Often in a {{master-slave}} arrangement {{when one}} device dubbed [...] "the master" [...] initiates all communication activity, the master device itself provides the bias {{and not the}} slave devices.

50|$|Ideally, the two ends of {{the cable}} will have a {{termination}} resistor connected across the two <b>wires.</b> Without <b>termination</b> resistors, reflections of fast driver edges can cause data corruption. Termination resistors also reduce electrical noise sensitivity due to the lower impedance. The value of each termination resistor should be equal to the cable characteristic impedance (typically, 120 ohms for twisted pairs). Somewhere along the set of wires, pull up or pull down resistors are established to fail-safe bias each data wire when the lines are not being driven by any device. This way, the lines will be biased to known voltages and nodes will not interpret the noise from undriven lines as actual data; without biasing resistors, the data lines float {{in such a way}} that electrical noise sensitivity is greatest when all device stations are silent or unpowered.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to quantitatively assess <b>wire</b> crimp <b>terminations</b> is discussed. The {{development of}} a prototype instrument, based on a modified, commercially available, crimp tool, is demonstrated for applying this technique when wire crimps are installed.

The crimp tool in this study is capable of crimping wire diameters ranging from 12 to 26 American Wire Gauge (AWG). A transducer design is presented that allows for interrogation of each of the three crimp locations on the crimp tool without reconfiguring the device. An analysis methodology, based on transmitted ultrasonic energy and timing of the first received pulse is shown to correlate to both crimp location in the tool and the AWG of the crimp/ferrule combination.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to assess quantitatively <b>wire</b> crimp <b>terminations</b> is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating at right angles to the wire axis and through the junction of a crimp termination is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which is a standard for assessing crimp wire junction quality. To demonstrate the technique, the case of incomplete compression of crimped connections is ultrasonically tested, and the results are correlated with pull tests. Results show that the nondestructive ultrasonic measurement technique consistently predicts good crimps when the ultrasonic transmission is above a certain threshold amplitude level. A quantitative measure {{of the quality of the}} crimped connection based on the ultrasonic energy transmitted is shown to respond accurately to crimp quality. A wave propagation model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process. This model is in agreement within 6 % of the ultrasonic measurements. A prototype instrument for applying this technique while wire crimps are installed is also presented.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{modeling and}} analysis of noise and interconnects in onchip communication. Besides transistor count and speed, the capabilities of a modern design are often limited by on-chip communication links. These links typically consist of multiple interconnects that run {{parallel to each other}} for long distances between functional or memory blocks. Due to the scaling of technology, the interconnects have considerable electrical parasitics that affect their performance, power dissipation and signal integrity. Furthermore, because of electromagnetic coupling, the interconnects in the link need to be considered as an interacting group instead of as isolated signal paths. There is a need for accurate and computationally effective models {{in the early stages of}} the chip design process to assess or optimize issues affecting these interconnects. For this purpose, a set of analytical models is developed for on-chip data links in this thesis. First, a model is proposed for modeling crosstalk and intersymbol interference. The model takes into account the effects of inductance, initial states and bit sequences. Intersymbol interference is shown to affect crosstalk voltage and propagation delay depending on bus throughput and the amount of inductance. Next, a model is proposed for the switching current of a coupled bus. The model is combined with an existing model to evaluate power supply noise. The model is then applied to reduce both functional crosstalk and power supply noise caused by a bus as a trade-off with time. The proposed reduction method is shown to be effective in reducing long-range crosstalk noise. The effects of process variation on encoded signaling are then modeled. In encoded signaling, the input signals to a bus are encoded using additional signaling circuitry. The proposed model includes variation in both the signaling circuitry and in the wires to calculate the total delay variation of a bus. The model is applied to study level-encoded dual-rail and 1 -of- 4 signaling. In addition to regular voltage-mode and encoded voltage-mode signaling, current-mode signaling is a promising technique for global communication. A model for energy dissipation in RLC current-mode signaling is proposed in the thesis. The energy is derived separately for the driver, <b>wire</b> and receiver <b>termination...</b>|$|R
