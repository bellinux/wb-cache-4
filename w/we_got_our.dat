25|$|Bill and I {{have many}} things in common. We share {{the same type of}} {{religion}} and boyhood background; <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} in Dublin and grew up at 48 Cherryfield Avenue in the Dublin suburb of Ranelagh. Her parents, Robert and Úna Brennan, were Republicans and were deeply {{involved}} in the Irish political and cultural struggles of the early twentieth century. They participated in the 1916 Easter Rising but while Úna was imprisoned for a few days, Robert was sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to penal servitude. His continuing political activity resulted in further imprisonments in 1917 and 1920. Maeve was born while he was in prison. He was director of publicity for the anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army during the Irish Civil War. He also founded and was the director of The Irish Press newspaper. His imprisonments and activities greatly fragmented Maeve Brennan's childhood. In her story The Day <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Our</b> Own Back she recounts her memory of how, when she was five, her home was raided by Free State forces looking for her father, who was on the run.|$|E
500|$|Wrigley {{became a}} {{familiar}} and popular {{figure for the}} thousands of Australian airmen who passed through London during the war, and was known to take off his jacket and tend bar at Codgers, the headquarters' watering hole. An EATS graduate later remarked that [...] "under Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley we got tremendous service... I was in North Africa, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica and then back in the United Kingdom. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> mail, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> comforts... Not only that, when some cow went and pinched 100 quid from me when I was on leave in London, the next day, with a shaking hand, I was able to sign for another 100 quid and have a good time." ...|$|E

500|$|... "When I got {{the song}} and the lyrics, I {{thought it was an}} {{incredible}} song... And, to me, {{it turned out to be}} a country song, when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> instrumentation on it and everything. And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' I just think music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side." ...|$|E
500|$|Dalglish {{was pleased}} with Liverpool's game and told the press: [...] "The most {{important}} thing is that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> own standard of football right. We were the better team in all departments and we know that if we get it right then we will be there or thereabouts." [...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. He tells you where to go and what position to take up." [...] He saw similarities with Liverpool and playing for a national team: [...] "The standards are so amazingly high. I just want to win things with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Harvard Girl was {{followed}} by numerous imitations by parents of other successful students, and {{is said to have}} spawned an entire genre of education [...] "manuals" [...] for Chinese parents, including similar books on how to get one's children into schools such as Oxford University, Cambridge University, or Cornell University. [...] This genre includes titles such as Ivy League is Not a Dream, From Andover to Harvard, How <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Our</b> Child Into Yale, Harvard Family Instruction, The Door of the Elite, Harvard Boy Zhang Zhaomu, Harvard Talents: Children Cultivated by the Karl Weter Educational Law, Tokyo University Boy, Cornell Girl, and Our Dumb Little Boy Goes to Cambridge.|$|E

500|$|Satisfied was {{released}} through Slanted Records on August 26, 2008, and debuted {{at its peak}} positions of number 116 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard Top Christian Albums charts. [...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> picture taken. It's a good thing we did it because when we got the pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{began writing}} lyrics {{for a new}} album prior to their {{appearance}} at the 1999 Ozzfest. However, every {{three to four months}} the band was distracted by commitments to Ozzfest, and worldwide [...] "Tattoo the Earth" [...] tour with Slipknot. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman later admitted [...] "that was the last break. Then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> shit together." [...] The band's longtime producer, Rick Rubin, was too busy to work with Slayer, and felt [...] "burned out"—unable to create intense music. Araya and King had similar feelings about Rubin, and King remarked he [...] "wanted to work with someone into the heavy-music scene, and Rubin's not anymore. I wanted somebody who knows what's hot, knows what's selling, knows the new techniques, and will keep me on my toes." [...] Rubin recommended two producers, although the first producer was not going to work out personality-wise according to Hanneman. The band gave second candidate, Matt Hyde, a trial on the song [...] "Bloodline", which appeared in the movie Dracula 2000. The band was pleased with Hyde's work on [...] "Bloodline" [...] and hired him to produce the entire album. [...] "Bloodline" [...] was also briefly used in the 2009 film Law Abiding Citizen. The song [...] "Here Comes the Pain" [...] had originally been recorded almost two years prior to the release of God Hates Us All, appearing on the compilation album [...] in 1999, and then used as the opening theme for WCW Thunder from February 16, 2000 to the final episode on March 21, 2001.|$|E
2500|$|One of Romário's best {{performances}} was {{scoring a}} hat-trick in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid in the El Clásico at the Camp Nou, with the spectacular opening goal seeing him drag the ball around the defender without it leaving his foot before finishing with a trademark toe-poke {{into the corner}} of the net. His highlight for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League came in the two games against Manchester United where he nutmegged Peter Schmeichel to score at Old Trafford, and scored again in the 4–0 win at the Camp Nou in front of 114,000 fans. Reflecting on the game at the Camp Nou, Manchester United captain Steve Bruce, who played in defence that night, states: “Of all the great things that happened during my career, the thing that sticks out the most is that night because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> backsides kicked big-style. Stoichkov and Romário are still etched in my memory, especially Romário, who was arguably the best player I ever faced." ...|$|E

2500|$|State {{attorneys}} called {{current and}} former police officers and the two lead prosecutors, who testified that the investigation had been careful, and that no witnesses had been coerced or threatened. The lead detective testified that his investigation was [...] "very meticulous and careful… I was in no rush just to pick the first guy <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> hands on. I wanted the right guy." [...] He stated that witnesses gave [...] "strikingly similar descriptions on how the shooter was dressed", mostly describing the shooter as wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, which other witnesses said Davis was wearing that evening. A state attorney asserted that the testimony of at least five prosecution witnesses remained unchallenged, and the evidence of Davis's guilt was overwhelming. In July 2010, Davis's lawyers filed a motion asking Moore to reconsider his decision to exclude testimony from a witness to a confession by Coles, but in August 2010, Moore stood by his initial decision, stating that in not calling Coles, Davis's lawyers were seeking to implicate Coles without desiring his rebuttal.|$|E
2500|$|The Republican Party {{sought to}} reverse its November 2008 losses {{in a series}} of special elections, which {{historically}} draw low voter turnout. In the January 13 special election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Delegate Brian Moran to run for Governor, Democrat Charniele Herring became the first African-American woman from Northern Virginia to be elected to the House of Delegates, defeating Republican candidate Joe Murray by 16 votes. She was seated on Jan. 26, following repeated efforts by the Republican caucus to delay her seating until a recount could be completed. Because Gerry Connolly was elected to Congress from the 11th District, a special election was held on February 3 to fill his seat as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. In that election, about 16% of the registered voters participated, and Democrat Sharon Bulova defeated Republican Pat Herrity by 1,206 votes. Anthony Bedell, chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Party told the Washington Post, [...] "In November, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>our</b> clocks cleaned. Three months later, even in a special this was a squeaker. That's good news for Republicans." [...] Another special election was held to fill Bulova's Braddock District board seat on March 10. Republican John Cook won the seat by 89 votes.|$|E
