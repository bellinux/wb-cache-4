5|$|The suspension—the longest that Campbell ever issued {{during his}} thirty-one-year tenure as league President—was {{considered}} by many in Montreal to be unjust and unduly severe. <b>Within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the judgment's dispensation, the NHL head office (then in Montreal) was deluged with hundreds of calls from enraged fans, many of whom made death threats against Campbell.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway {{and to other}} injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
5|$|With the film's Laserdisc release, Variety first {{reported}} in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character. While undetectable when {{played at the}} usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether {{or not they were}} actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.|$|E

5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> issuing {{the signal}} and turning his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte, Howe's plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging {{back in the}} original line. Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was a ragged formation tipped by Queen Charlotte that headed unevenly for Villaret's fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, {{but the lack of}} training and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe's order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{cannonball}} {{from the}} second French broadside struck Corbet <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the first broadside, the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the gunwale struck the thigh of the same leg, shattering the bone. Corbet was brought below to the ship's surgeon where the remnant of his leg was hastily amputated and bound, and command devolved on Lieutenant John Crew Tullidge. At 02:30, Astrée pulled away from Africaine to perform hasty repairs, but Bouvet's guns had wrecked Africaines rigging, leaving the British frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile. Slowly moving ahead, Africaine engaged Iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by Astrée and found herself assailed on both sides, Astrée angled in such a position {{that she was able}} to rake the British ship, inflicting significant damage and casualties.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Captain Mends on Arethusa, {{casualties}} were severe on both sides. Amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from {{a crew of}} 222, while the French ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339. Recriminations among the British officers began <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the French surrender: Mends took possession of Niémen and sent a note to Seymour informing {{him that he had}} seized the valuable French nautical charts and the French captain's personal stores. The note also requested that Seymour send back Arethusas surgeon, who had gone aboard Amethyst to assist with the wounded, so that Mends could be ready to leave without notice. Seymour, who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties, responded angrily, forcing Mends to back down and return the stores. Seymour was also annoyed by Mends' late arrival, which meant that Arethusa was entitled to half the prize money from the captured frigate without having done any of the fighting. Repairs were completed on 7 April, and Amethyst and Niémen limped back to Plymouth, arriving on 13 April.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state of alert, and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due to the darkness. <b>Within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced {{to try to reach}} their Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At the end of the raid those commandos who had not been killed all became prisoners of war. Only five of the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The FAA {{was aware}} {{at this point}} that there was an {{emergency}} on board the airplane. By this time, Flight 11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 175 was known to have been hijacked and was <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> striking the South Tower. After learning of this second hijacking involving an American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving United Airlines, American Airlines' executive vice president Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline. The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time the airplane was hijacked, it was flying over an area of limited radar coverage. With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the Boeing 757 had possibly crashed at 09:09.|$|E
5|$|The {{culmination}} of a three-month siege by the British, the battle lasted about an hour. British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadien militia under General Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm, employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe received three gunshot wounds that ended his life <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> {{the beginning of the}} engagement and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs. In the wake of the battle, the French evacuated the city; their remaining military force in Canada and the rest of North America came under increasing pressure from British forces.|$|E

5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and {{linolenic acid}} is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} {{and boats}} from Magicienne sought {{but failed to}} take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E
