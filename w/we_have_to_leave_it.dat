It was Macheson's money and Macheson's idea. We've got an entire village now near Llandirog, and the whole {{population}} come from the prisons. Macheson and I used to attend the police-courts ourselves, hear all the cases, and form our own conclusions as to the prisoners. If we thought there was any hope for them, we made a note, met them when they came out, and offered them a job, on probation--in our village. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to the chaplains now--I can't spare time to be always in London. We've two woollen mills, a saw-mill, and a bakery, besides all the shops, and nearly a thousand acres of well-farmed land. At first the people round were terribly shy of us, but that's all over now. Why, we have less trouble with the police in our village than any for miles around. We're paying our way, too." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2015, in a {{televised}} interview, Trump said [...] "Having a low minimum wage {{is not a bad}} thing for this country." [...] On November 10, 2015, speaking at a Republican debate, Trump said he opposed increasing the U.S. minimum wage, saying that doing so would hurt America's economic competitiveness. At the same debate, Trump said {{in response to a question}} about the minimum wage and the economy as a whole: [...] "...taxes too high, wages too high, we’re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> the way it is." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Ouninpohja {{stage was}} {{split into two}} parts for the 2005 and 2006 events, as Petter Solberg had {{exceeded}} the FIA's maximum average speed (130 km/h) in 2004. The rule was changed for 2007 and Ouninpohja returned as a 33 km version, although the organisers added three chicanes. However, the stage was {{left out of the}} route in 2008. Jarmo Mahonen, managing director of AKK Sports, stated that [...] "the matter was discussed with the FIA already last year, and at the time we were able to keep Ouninpohja as a part of our route. This year <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> out for safety reasons." [...] In 2012, the Ouninpohja stage returned and also served as the power stage. The stage ranges from 97 m to a maximum of 180 m in elevation.|$|E

6000|$|... "Three eggs," [...] said he. [...] "I think Dorothy has {{not been}} out here to-day. That is the {{beginning}} of your profits. You can take two of them; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> one for the nest-egg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you know, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{some one}} <b>to</b> {{look after the}} smack, an' I left Luke Trevor, as he said he'd prefer to come to evenin' service, an' Billy said he'd like to stay with Luke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear sister, {{there is}} still a little difficulty, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> all agreed that any girl we met should die at our hands, because it was {{for the sake of a}} girl that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> our kingdom.' ...|$|R
60|$|I wish I were in Switzerland, and I wish {{we could}} go <b>to</b> Florence; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> these delights <b>to</b> you; there is no helping it. We all join in love to you and all the family.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> without {{satisfaction}} {{you will}} go with Mr. Briarly, the detective," [...] cried Matt. [...] "Now {{you can take your}} choice. I am no longer your office boy, and you cannot twist me around your finger." ...|$|R

"Oh, yes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him behind, though Francie {{was ready}} to break her heart over it; but they said that nothing would do for Ivinghoe--after this second influenza--but a sea voyage, so she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make up her mind <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him <b>to</b> my mother." ...|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, Tito {{declared}} that Yugoslavia <b>had</b> the right <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Trieste {{and all of}} Carinthia, including Austrian Carinthia, saying [...] "We have liberated Carinthia but international conditions were such that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it temporarily.

5000|$|... “As you know, {{conflicting}} agendas dominated and {{so after}} a two years stalemate, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> I’m {{not the kind of}} person to stay just for money or for press. When you are witnessing the suffering of a people, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make the right decision at the right moment.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The non-album B-side [...] "There is Love" [...] {{features}} Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin on guitar. {{the song}} was left out because [...] "It didn't {{fit in with the}} final context of the album."

6000|$|... "But {{it is my}} home!" [...] she answered, looking hurt at my {{careless}} words.

6000|$|... "Of course, in time," [...] was the prompt answer. [...] "I'm sorry <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon behind us, for they'd come {{in handy}} just now; but {{with the end of}} our journey in sight a tramp across these pretty green fields won't tire us a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep {{watch for}} the first show of fire, Master Grout, an' we'll see that you're posted {{as to what is}} bein' done outside. If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> here, it'll be a good idee to draw off toward the rope-walk; there's no one near by that place, an' we may {{contrive}} to steer clear of the enemy." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 it was {{reported}} during misty nights the lit glasshouses were a source of light pollution in the form [...] "a clearly visible night glow". The company were quoted [...] "For ventilation purposes <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> tiny gaps where the blinds meet.

60|$|Saturday, Jan. 9.—Strolled {{about all}} the forenoon. “What a time of blessed {{composure}} it has been,” said Mr. G. with a heavy sigh. The distant hills covered with snow, {{and the voice of}} the storm gradually swelling. Still the savage fury of the sea was yet some hours off, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Biarritz without the spectacle of Atlantic rage at its fiercest.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Sam, [...] "this {{may turn}} out to be a small barren island, in which case <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it and trust to falling in with some vessel; or it may be {{inhabited}} by savages or pirates, in which case <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it from prudential motives, if they will allow us to do so. In any case, we won't begin by being extravagant with the provisions to-day." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{are facing}} a common enemy and that enemy is Yankee Imperialism, which is killing us both here and abroad. Now I think anyone who would try to {{separate}} those struggles, anyone who would say {{that in order to}} consolidate an anti-war movement, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right {{into the hands of the}} enemy", she declared.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} elementary transformations between minimal {{models of}} rational surfaces {{in terms of}} unprojections. These do not fit into the framework of Kustin–Miller unprojections as introduced by Papadakis and Reid, since <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the world of projectively Gorenstein varieties. Also, our unprojections do {{not depend on the}} choice of the unprojection locus only, but need extra data corresponding to the choice of a divisor on this unprojection locus...|$|R

40|$|We {{play with}} a graph-theoretic {{analogue}} of the folklore infinite monkey theorem. We define a notion of graph likelihood as {{the probability that a}} given graph is constructed by a monkey in a number of time steps equal to the number of vertices. We present an algorithm to compute this graph invariant and closed formulas for some infinite classes. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the computational complexity of the likelihood as an open problem.
