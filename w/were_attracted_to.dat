5|$|In Canada and Sweden it {{has been}} shown that growing a mosaic of {{different}} crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of oilseed rape, despite the fact that the bees <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the crop.|$|E
5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, males <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> other male scents.|$|E
5|$|Sunday's {{popularity}} waned after World War I, {{when many}} people in his revival audiences <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> radio broadcasts and moving pictures instead. The Sundays' health also declined even as they continued to drive themselves through rounds of revivals—smaller but also with fewer staff members to assist them.|$|E
50|$|Adult males <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> damp {{patches and}} traps baited with fish, prawn or toad. Both sexes <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> flowers.|$|R
50|$|Sexuality (色気): The higher this is, {{the more}} Shinji will <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> girls. The lower it is, {{the more he}} will <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> boys.|$|R
50|$|Adults of {{both sexes}} <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> flowers and males <b>are</b> also <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> bird droppings.|$|R
5|$|Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} English-speaking settlers {{as early as}} the late 1730s. The majority of these settlers had come from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, many of whom were either Quakers or former Quakers who <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the Baptist and Methodist denominations.|$|E
5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> these groups so {{it seems likely that the}} males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. As {{with the majority of}} towns and cities in Ireland, Banagher has seen an influx of foreign nationals, mostly of Eastern European origin, in recent years and these now make up just over 10% of the population.|$|E
50|$|Adults fly in {{the forest}} under storey {{as well as on}} top of the canopy. Both sexes <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> flowers and males mud-puddle and <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> urine patches.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} that beetles <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the pheromone ipslure. They are also thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> ethanol, one of the byproducts of microbial growth in dead woody tissues.|$|R
50|$|Adults <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> flowers, {{especially}} those of Costus species and gingers. Adult males <b>are</b> also <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> bird droppings.|$|R
5|$|Monster Inc. is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} and markets about 6,000 products, but {{is best known}} for audio and video cables. It also produces speakers, headphones, power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the cable's profit margins.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of {{settlers}} <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the Dakota Territory in the 1870s and 1880s for its cheap land, and {{the population}} began to rise. Many established small family farms, but some investors bought thousands of acres for bonanza farms, where they supervised the cultivation and harvesting of wheat as a commodity crop. The city grew quickly after {{the arrival of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887. In 1883, the University of North Dakota was established, six years before North Dakota was admitted as an independent state born from the Dakota Territory.|$|E
5|$|When Reid took office, Alberta was {{experiencing}} the Great Depression. Reid took measures to ease Albertans' suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic recovery {{was beyond the}} capacity of the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the economic theories of evangelical preacher William Aberhart, who advocated a version of social credit. Despite Reid's claims that Aberhart's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid's party did not retain a single seat. Reid lived forty-five years after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.|$|E
50|$|Males <b>are</b> often <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> and fly to light, {{and females}} <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> {{molasses}} {{used as a}} bait. The species has also <b>been</b> reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> at night <b>to</b> honeydew secreted by aphids on pear species.|$|R
50|$|In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss {{develops}} {{the theory that}} people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form. For example, {{a person with a}} weak basic desire for social contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> religious retreats, while a person with a strong basic desire for Social Contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> religious festivals. A person with a weak basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> passages in scriptures that speak of peace and forgiveness, while a person with a strong basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> passages that speak of revenge.|$|R
50|$|They <b>are</b> not <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> human {{habitation}} or foods. As a detritivore and coprovore, the egg-bearing females <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> rotting food or manure.|$|R
5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source and reduce costs by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable artesian water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E
5|$|In the {{ten years}} after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al. The Spanish <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the {{mountains}} but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because {{of the effects of the}} Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior. Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's in New York as well as $350 worth of carpets. They installed central heating in 1850 and gaslight in 1853. During their time in the house, the Longfellows hosted famous artists, writers, politicians and other luminaries who <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> Longfellow's hospitality and fame. Specific visitors included Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, singer Jenny Lind, and actress Fanny Kemble. Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and James Russell Lowell. Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home. Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|E

50|$|Both sexes <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> fermenting fruit, but males <b>are</b> also <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> animal droppings. The larvae feed on Annona senegalensis, Hugonia platysepala and Trema species.|$|R
50|$|Adults <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> bananas.|$|R
5|$|The English {{settlers}} <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the Darby Creek watershed due to {{the proximity}} to trading routes and productive landscape. In 1777, British soldiers breached dikes and floodwalls that were constructed on the creek. The Pennsylvania legislature passed an act in 1788 that mandated a maintenance of the dikes and the mowing of plants such as elderberries and pokeweed three times a year. Early English colonists utilized Darby Creek {{as a source of}} water power. Lumber, grist, and textile mills were established {{along the banks of the}} creek. Most of these mills have been demolished, although some of the tenement structures are currently in use as housing. At the end of the 19th century, industrial advances such as engine-driven machinery had made these mills obsolete.|$|E
5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore {{entrapment}} was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that {{only a few of the}} carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1928 {{until his}} death, al-Qassam {{served as the}} {{president}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism with the lower classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was bridged by a convergence in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time. While men from al-Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam's cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation.|$|E

5|$|The Master Institute of United Arts {{came into}} being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts. It {{struggled}} to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he bought on {{the site where the}} Master Building would later be constructed. Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, was a friend of Frances Grant who directed the Master School for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in art education as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core of a spiritual and cultural movement known as Roerichism.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Layla {{was moved}} to the ECW brand, debuting on 23 January 2007. She joined Brooke and Kelly Kelly to form Extreme Exposé. The trio performed a weekly dance segment on ECW, choreographed by Layla, for the next several months. In June 2007, The Miz {{was moved to}} the brand, prompting a storyline in which all three members of Extreme Exposé <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> him. When Kelly shifted her attentions towards Balls Mahoney, Layla, Brooke, and Miz openly mocked her, turning Layla and Brooke into villainous characters in the process. On 1 November, Brooke was released from her WWE contract, and Extreme Exposé dissolved as a group, leaving Kelly and Layla to enter an ongoing rivalry with more active in-ring roles. They were on opposite sides of a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, which Layla's team lost. In December, Layla formed an alliance with Victoria, which expanded to include Lena Yada in January 2008, and the trio continued to feud with Kelly. At WrestleMania XXIV, Layla was a lumberjill for the Divas' tag team lumberjill match. The following month, Layla was part of the winning team in a six-on-six Divas match at the Backlash pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|Witton {{elaborated}} in 2012 and 2013 on {{the idea}} that Istiodactylus was a scavenger. Scavenging birds have a mosaic of strong and weak elements in their skulls; {{they do not have to}} struggle with their prey, but need to be able to tear and pull morsels from cadavers. These birds also have relatively small eyes compared to predatory birds, as they do not need to search for hiding animals, or to make carefully judged attacks on their prey. Istiodactylus appears to have had large jaw muscles, and therefore a strong bite, and the skull was deep, which would have helped resist bending when pulling flesh. Individual bones of the skull were instead slender and shallow, and the toothrows were short, which indicates Istiodactylus did not have the necessary reinforcements for predation, and did not have to subdue struggling prey. Together, these features indicate Istiodactylus fed on large prey that necessitated strong jaws for processing, yet was also motionless enough so that strain on the jaws and skull could be controlled during feeding. The eyes of Istiodactylus also seem to have been proportionally small, compared to pterosaurs that are presumed to have been predatory (such as ornithocheirids). Witton concluded that among pterosaurs, Istiodactylus appears to have been the best-adapted for a scavenging lifestyle. He envisioned that istiodactylids would have to step back from a carcass if more powerful carnivores <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> it, but would return to finish the remains when those animals were satiated.|$|E
