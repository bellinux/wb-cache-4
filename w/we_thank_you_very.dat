In Boston, Stapp continued her philanthropic work by forming The World Neighbor Club in 1923, {{in cooperation with the}} American Red Cross.

In a thank-you letter, a student from The Albanian Vocational School writes to Stapp, “We <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much for the kindness you have done the Albanian children, and <b>we</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> also <b>very</b> much for the books you send to us.

5000|$|On {{the same}} day the American crewmembers were {{released}} with their vessels, Iran released a series of images and videos which, among other things, showed the U.S. navy sailors on their knees with their hands clasped behind their heads as they were being apprehended on their vessels. Two of the videos featured one of the Americans, apparently the lieutenant commanding the boats, apologizing and praising Iran's treatment: [...] "It was a mistake that was our fault, and we apologize for our mistake... The Iranian behavior was fantastic while we were here and <b>we</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much for your hospitality and your assistance." [...] According to Politico, these pictures and footage further [...] "inflamed the American debate over sailors' capture, including {{the question of whether the}} U.S. had formally apologized for entering Iranian territory." [...] Michael Pregent, an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute and a retired U.S. military officer, said the photos and video, which were used for propaganda purposes and made the sailors readily identifiable, violated articles 13 and 17 of the Geneva Convention. [...] US State Department Spokesman John Kirby addressed the issue, explaining [...] "the Geneva Convention applies for wartime. We’re not at war with Iran". A Defense Department official said that the Navy lieutenant’s filmed apology was probably intended to defuse a potentially volatile situation.|$|E
