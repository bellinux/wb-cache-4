25|$|In the 18th century, {{the concept}} that {{the age of the}} Earth was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear.

500|$|Instead of {{selecting}} from the numerous, basic backing tracks Sadler had collected before the sessions, Chuck D wanted {{for the production}} team to improvise beats in the studio. This led to much of Fear of a Black Planets music being composed on the spot. Chuck D said he spent numerous hours listening to various tapes, music records, and other audio sources in search of samples for the album. Of their search for samples, Hank Shocklee said, [...] "When you’re talking {{about the kind of}} sampling that Public Enemy did, we had to comb through thousands of records to come up <b>with</b> <b>maybe</b> five good pieces. And as we started putting together those pieces, the sound got a lot more dense." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do <b>with</b> <b>maybe</b> being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Prost had {{the firm}} belief that Honda and Ron Dennis viewed Senna {{as the future}} of the team. Prost {{recalled}} that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one car <b>with</b> <b>maybe</b> four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him. Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining Ferrari. Although Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments, he received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his [...] teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not seem to work as well as was once normal. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if there was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use.|$|E

Scrapping {{many of the}} earlier recorded tracks (see recording sessions), Smith said he was [...] "taking a production role for the whole album as well as co-authoring about half its tracks". Lewis would later talk of the album's delay and Smith's involvement, describing the original release dates as rough guides. Following Lewis' performance at BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Smith revealed that the album was 80% complete, [...] "We've got the key tracks and we're very close." [...] Describing the process as {{a stark contrast to}} previous albums Spirit and Echo, Smith said that when you work with many producers [...] "you end up <b>with</b> <b>maybe</b> two or three radio songs and not necessarily the album sales you want." [...] Lewis spoke to reporters back stage after the performance, revealing that the album had been brought forward a month to October 2012. By the time July had come around, Smith updated fans to say that the album was now 97% complete.|$|E

If anybody had told me that it would take me two years to pay back that forty-six dollars to the banker (for I did not expect it of the Prodigal, and was not disappointed), I would have felt injured. And so would the banker.|$|E
60|$|He was {{no longer}} the moonstruck youth of the {{previous}} night, on whom phantasy and imagination could play what pranks they chose. That part of him the keen, fresh morning air had driven back into its cell. He was Commander Raffleton, an eager and alert young engineer with all his wits about him. At this point that has to be remembered. Descending on a lonely reach of shore he proceeded to again disturb Malvina for the purpose of extracting tins. He expected his passenger would in broad daylight prove to be a pretty, childish-looking girl, somewhat dishevelled, <b>with,</b> <b>maybe,</b> a tinge of blue about the nose, the natural result of a three-hours' flight at fifty miles an hour. It was with a startling return of his original sensations when first she had come to life beneath his kiss that he halted a few feet away and stared at her. The night was gone, and the silence. She stood there facing the sunlight, clad in a Burberry overcoat half a dozen sizes too large for her. Beyond her was a row of bathing-machines, and beyond that again a gasometer. A goods train half a mile away was noisily shunting trucks.|$|E
