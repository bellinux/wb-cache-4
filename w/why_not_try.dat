500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give you no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy." [...] At the 50th Grammy Awards held on February 10, 2008 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Confessions Tour won in the category of Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore. He later recalled, [...] "I realized that the whole episode was framed around Byers telling his story to a Baltimore homicide detective. So I figured 'what the heck? Homicides a great show, so <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing around in my backyard, and [...] I just turned to him and said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda! X is the assassin, it's not some other character, it's our X. [...] He wouldn't kill the Gunmen, 'cause he's trying to help Mulder.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've got an idea," [...] {{said our}} hero, after another pause. [...] "Do {{you see that}} hollow just below here? Well, we haven't looked around that much. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> it to-morrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strategy, my dear Brill," [...] he said, smiling; [...] "strategy. Now why {{waste your}} time? Why not make some other woman happy? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> her companion, Miss Philpotts? I’m sure any little assistance—" ...|$|E

6000|$|Van Loo {{had been}} seized with another {{inspiration}} of desperation. Steptoe had been {{partly responsible for}} this situation. Van Loo knew that Jack and Steptoe were not friends. He had certain secrets of Steptoe's that might be of importance to Jack. <b>Why</b> should he <b>not</b> <b>try</b> {{to make friends with}} this powerful free-lance and half-outlaw? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{not fight}} for her, then? Don't let {{one of these}} boys walk off with her. Look at her. She likes fun and admiration. I believe you do care for her. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> to win her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{think of}} some woman, then," [...] said Fulkerson, easily. [...] "I've got a notion that the women could help us out on this thing, come to get 'em interested. There ain't {{anything}} so popular as female fiction; <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> female art?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked {{surprised}} and relieved. [...] "Then, in heaven's name, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> and {{forget all about}} it? You have friends and relations now, and seem to have made {{the best of your}} opportunities. Is there anything to be gained by stirring up the past?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The secret {{you have}} told me {{is not exactly a}} secret as Edwin (Booth's brother) was told by someone, you were paying great {{attention}} to a young lady in Washington, and if the lady in question is all you desire- I see no cause <b>why</b> you should <b>not</b> <b>try</b> to secure her. ... Her father ... would he give his consent? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But we," [...] she answered, [...] "should only die to live, {{and that}} is <b>why</b> I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to be afraid. I daresay, however, I mean {{the same as they}} did, only you do not seem to have put their thought quite clearly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Midwinter {{shook his}} head. [...] "Our time is short," [...] he said; [...] "and the man {{may not be}} at liberty. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> in the {{neighborhood}} first?

50|$|Vistilia was {{accordingly}} {{tried by}} the Roman Senate for immorality. Her husband, Titidius Labeo, asked <b>why</b> he had <b>not</b> <b>tried</b> {{to enforce the}} statutory penalty, stated the consultation period (which was 60 days) had not yet expired. The senate decided to prosecute only Vistilia (under Roman law, husbands who did not immediately punish adulterous wives could be tried as pimps). Vistilia {{was found guilty of}} prostitution and she was deported to the Greek island of Seriphos.|$|R
5000|$|I {{had come}} up out of that whole {{alternative}} scene, which was all about, [...] "Don’t try it, man. Just go up and wing it." [...] I {{think a lot of}} that comes from insecurity. It's that fashion of improv and amateurism that comes from the insecurity of saying to the audience, [...] "Well, it doesn't matter if it doesn't go well, because I didn’t even try that hard to begin with." [...] It's like, [...] "Oh, that's <b>why</b> you're <b>not</b> <b>trying.</b> If you actually tried hard and it sucked, then you've got to blame yourself." [...] So that's what makes it hard for some people to sit down and actually just do the fucking work, because doing the work means you're making a commitment.|$|R
5000|$|Dr Van Den Boogert continues: [...] "Ar {{is one of}} {{the great}} draughtsmen of our time. He excels in rapid sketches, but also in {{extremely}} detailed studies, done in graphite and charcoal, or in white pencil on black paper. The expressive power and the plasticity of his drawings have such graphic qualities, that one wonders <b>why</b> he has <b>not</b> <b>tried</b> his skills on graphic art yet. But that may be one of his future projects: perhaps the best is yet to come." ...|$|R
60|$|JUDITH. Then <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> to save {{yourself}}? I implore you--listen.

6000|$|... "Well, perhaps you're right. I {{never knew}} but {{three men who}} took long constitutionals on principle, {{and two of them}} were cracked. But <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> a companion; and persuade that curate, who needs just the same {{medicine}} as you, to accompany you? I don't know a more gentleman-like, agreeable, well-informed man than he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like it," [...] said Allan. [...] "I don't {{like your}} leaving {{me in this}} sudden manner. There's {{something}} so strange and dreary about it. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> riding, {{if you want more}} exercise; all the horses in the stables are at your disposal. At all events, you can't possibly go to-day. Look at the rain!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he insisted. [...] "They {{would have}} killed you when they had you prisoner. They would kill you now {{if they could get}} their hands on you, and they would eat you into the bargain. But I know <b>why</b> you do <b>not</b> <b>try</b> it--it is because you have spoken lies; your weapon will not kill at a great distance. It is only a queerly wrought club. For all I know, you are nothing more than a lowly Bo-lu." ...|$|R
60|$|Rip {{the veil}} of the old vision across, and walk through the rent. And if I try to do this--well, <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> If I <b>try</b> to write down what I see--why not? If a {{publisher}} likes to print the book--all right. And if anybody wants to read it, let him. But why anybody should read one single word if he doesn't want to, I don't see. Unless of course he is a critic who needs to scribble a dollar's worth of words, no matter how.|$|R
6000|$|... 6 George Granville (see Letter 14, note 5), now Baron Lansdowne, married Lady Mary Thynne, {{widow of}} Thomas Thynne, and {{daughter}} of Edward, Earl of Jersey (see Letter 29, note 3). In October 1710 Lady Wentworth {{wrote to her}} son, [...] "Pray, my dear, why will you let Lady Mary Thynne go?

6000|$|... "So {{you don't}} {{want to marry}} this Miles {{because he is not}} handsome. You'd better think again before you make up your mind.

You need some one {{to take care of you}} sadly," [...] David said, when her story had been told.|$|E
6000|$|In {{his studio}} {{he began to}} sort his sketches, wash his brushes, and drag out things he had {{accumulated}} during his two months' stay. He even began to fold his blanket door.

Call the picture--Spring...! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] I said, [...] "the buffalo {{probably}} {{long ago}} departed. Also {{there has been}} a war with Sekukuni, the Basuto chief who rules all that country, which remains undecided, although I believe some kind of a peace has been patched up. This may make hunting in this neighborhood dangerous. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> some other ground, {{to the north of the}} Transvaal, for instance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well," [...] said Pheasant, [...] "but {{then one}} wants to do {{something}} worth doing, if one is going to do anything. One would like to be grand and heroic, if one could; but if <b>not,</b> <b>why</b> <b>try</b> at all? One wants to be very something, very great, very heroic; or if not that, then at least very stylish and very fashionable. It is this everlasting mediocrity that bores me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am not angry. I {{should never}} dare {{to be angry}} with you. I only wish that Felix would be better. They say that young men have to be bad, {{and that they do}} get to be better as they grow older.

Roger could express no hope in this direction or even look as though he approved of the directorship. 'I don't see <b>why</b> he should <b>not</b> <b>try</b> at any rate.' ...|$|R
60|$|What I {{wondered}} was <b>why</b> {{they had}} <b>not</b> <b>tried</b> to ambush {{us in the}} reeds, since our fires must have shown them that we were close upon their heels. That they did try to burn us out was clear from certain evidences that I found, but fortunately at this season {{of the year in}} the absence of a strong wind the rank reeds were too green to catch fire. For the rest I was soon to learn the reason of their neglect to attack us in that dense cover.|$|R
