2500|$|On 28 March 2007, the National Audiovisual Council gave a 10,000-lei (€3000) fine to Prima TV's primetime satire-comedy show, Cronica Cârcotașilor, {{for making}} {{homophobic}} comments. In two episodes, the show's presenters had allegedly {{made fun of}} Mircea Solcanu, an Acasă TV presenter who had come out as gay. The president of the National Audiovisual Council, Ralu Filip, justified the fine by stating that, [...] "I felt it was unacceptable {{the way in which}} they made fun of a sexual orientation in this way, especially since it was about a colleague." [...] This represents the first time an audiovisual programme has been fined for homophobia in Romania, based on Article 46 of the Audiovisual Law, which prevents programmes from containing any discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. The incident sparked off a public debate regarding homophobia and representations of LGBT people in the mass media. Attila Gasparik, the vice-president of the National Audiovisual Council, stated that Cronica Cârcotașilor, as well as other high-profile TV shows, will continue being held under [...] "strict observation... because they have a very high impact, reason for which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> rigorous in our monitoring." ...|$|E

The problem is the goal [...] [...] [...] The official BDS movement, they claim to be agnostic, neutral—whatever term you want to use—on the question of Israel. You can’t reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of Israel. The broad public wants to know, where do you stand? And if you claim not to have a stand, you lose them. The BDS movement, it always says, and I’m using their language, [...] "We are a rights-based organization. We are based in international law." [...] I agree with that. That’s where you have to go: rights-based international law. But the international law is clear. You read the last sentence of the 2004 International Court of Justice opinion on the wall that Israel has been building in the West Bank, and the last sentence says, [...] "We look forward to two states: a Palestinian state alongside Israel and at peace with its neighbors." [...] That's the law.And {{if you want to go}} past that law or ignore the Israel part, you’ll never reach a broad public. And then it's a cult. Then it’s pointless, in my opinion. We're wasting time. And it's only a wasting of time. It becomes—and I know it's a strong word, and I hope I won't be faulted for it, but it becomes historically criminal, because there was a time where whatever we said, it made no difference. Nobody was listening. You could shout whatever you want—who cares? But now, actually, we can reach people. There is a possibility. I’m not saying a certainty. I'm not even saying a probability. But there is a possibility that we can reach a broad public.
