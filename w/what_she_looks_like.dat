5|$|Mercer {{travels to}} a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that {{he moved to}} Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande à parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working, and retrieves the car.|$|E

[...] When filming Chamber of Secrets, Watson was [...] "adamant" [...] that she wasn't like Hermione, but she reflects that [...] "as I got older, I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have." [...] In 2007, before the release of Order of the Phoenix, Watson said, [...] "There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When I was nine or ten, I would get really upset {{when they tried to}} make me look geeky, but now I absolutely love it. I find it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> She's a complete tomboy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't," [...] insisted Hannah, [...] "that's a fact. I'll {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> in that hat and cloak--a bad woman. I don't say she is--I don't know what I'd do if I thought she was, but I never {{expected}} {{my daughter to}} look like one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm rather glad of that, because I {{can imagine}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> without being {{hampered}} by facts. I {{think she was}} very slight and small, with softly curling dark hair and big, sweet, timid brown eyes, and a little wistful, pale face." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{combination}} of mixed reviews, misleading advertising (the publicity focused on glamour shots of Helen Morgan, not <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in the film), downbeat subject matter, and the Stock Market Crash caused {{the movie to}} taper off significantly {{as soon as it}} left the Criterion.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unknown}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> {{as the only}} {{portrait}} known to be painted of her has been lost. Apart from that, the only other existing painting of Lamorlière is Marie-Antoinette, le matin de son exécution, painted by Tony Robert-Fleury during the 19th century, {{and he had never}} seen her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I tell you, granny, if you bottle {{a fellow}} up too tight he'll split,' said Tom Loker. 'But about Eliza--tell them to dress her up some way {{so as to}} alter her.

6000|$|... "Yes. One or {{two little}} things have cropped up. And your story, little lady, {{confirms}} my idea. They know we're looking for Jane Finn. Well, they'll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a pensionnat in Paris." [...] Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled. [...] "No one knows {{in the least}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> so that's all right. She's primed with a trumped-up tale, and her real business is {{to get as much}} information as possible out of us. See the idea?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Nobody Knows My Face! - Millie Mason is {{a budding}} actress with dreams of {{becoming}} a star. It seems she’s {{on her way to}} fame when she gets spotted by an agent, Eddie Tanner. Unfortunately every role she gets cast in she ends up in a costume, mask or in the shadows, so nobody sees <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> Her agent also thinks keeping the mystery of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> will make her an even bigger star, with a big reveal.|$|E
60|$|Slowly, slowly, {{the light}} figure went round the great circle of gazers, ministering obediently to their pleasure, waiting patiently till their curiosity was satisfied. And now, her weary pilgrimage was well nigh {{over for the}} night. She {{had arrived at the}} last group of spectators who had yet to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> close, and <b>what</b> tricks <b>she</b> could exhibit with her cards.|$|R
6000|$|The {{marriage}} {{was to be}} at eleven o'clock, and, at nine, I went up to help Phillippa dress. She was no fussy bride, caring much <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> If Owen had been the bridegroom {{it would have been}} different. Nothing would have pleased her then; but now it was only just [...] "That will do very well, Aunt Rachel," [...] without even glancing at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a sad}} story," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl, [...] "and it {{happened}} fifty years ago, when Grandfather and Grandmother King were quite young. Grandmother's cousin Rachel Ward came to spend a winter with them. She belonged to Montreal and she was an orphan too, just like the Family Ghost. I have never heard <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> but <b>she</b> MUST have been beautiful, of course." ...|$|R

5000|$|Reason: Mrs. Shrager, Ms. Harbord, and Ms. Conner {{all felt}} that Amandas {{constant}} fighting and cursing was disruptive. Plus when Mrs. Shrager woke everyone up {{that morning and}} shockingly saw that Amanda was covered in a mess of make-up, <b>she</b> asked Amanda <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> to which Amanda rudely replied, [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Im {{in a lot of}} fucking pain right now," [...] causing Mrs. Shrager to become infuriated.|$|R
60|$|Never {{before on}} a Sunday {{afternoon}} had Miss Drewitt known {{the streets of}} Binchester to be so full of people. She hurried on with bent head, looking straight before her, trying to imagine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> There {{was no sign of}} the captain, but as they turned into Dialstone Lane they both saw a huge, shaggy, grey head protruding from the small window of his bedroom. It disappeared with a suddenness almost startling.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's all right,' Dick stopped her. 'His {{work and}} habits {{have nothing to}} do with the matter. Now you are sure you have never {{encouraged}} Mr. Smith in any way?' And she was so sure that she talked for ten minutes, detailing the foreman's persedition of her. She had a pleasant voice--one of those sweet, timid, woman's voices, and undoubtedly is quite attractive. It was all I could do to resist peeping. I wanted to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R

When Phyllis is unable to find work, Claire has her fiance, advertising man Allan Wesson, take her on as a secretary.|$|E
50|$|The {{king and}} queen are worried because their daughter, Princess Camilla, is very plain, or rather appears to be plain because of a spell put on her at birth. The spell says that only the eyes of true love will reveal her beauty. Her parents {{come up with a}} plan to marry her to a prince from a far-away land who doesn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> They force Camilla to trade places with her {{beautiful}} but silly maid, Dulcibella, before the prince arrives.|$|E
50|$|After {{breaking}} up with her Evan goes to his cousin Quincy and asks him to talk to her,hopefully convincing her that Evan's a good guy.Since Quincy has never met her,he doesn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> so Evan tells him that she has long black hair. (As it turns out,that day, Nicky had cut her hair to a short length she described as being like Halle Berry). Quincy and Nicky end up sitting {{next to each other}} at the bar where Nicky was supposed to meet Evan. Quincy tells her that he's looking for his cousin's ex-girlfriend Nicky who has long black hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "So can I--an' I've {{only been}} to Auckland twice--how <b>she</b> stood an' <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was sayin' an' <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> That's the secret. 'Tisn't beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It's just It. Some women'll {{stay in a}} man's memory if they once walked down a street, but most of 'em {{you can live with}} a month on end, an' next {{commission}} you'd be put to it to certify whether they talked in their sleep or not, as one might say." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus mused Godfrey, {{trying to}} picture to himself <b>what</b> Isobel <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> when <b>she</b> had stood {{by his side}} on that long-past autumn eve, and only succeeded in remembering exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> when <b>she</b> was kissing a rose with a certain knight in armour in a square garden, since for some perverse reason it was this picture that {{remained}} so painfully clear to his mind. Then he drifted off into speculations upon the general mystery of things of a sort that were common with him, and in these became oblivious of all else.|$|R

5000|$|A Nue {{appears as}} the boss for the Extra Stage of the twelfth Touhou Project game, Undefined Fantastic Object, and is named Nue Houjuu. This Nue {{has the ability}} to conceal her true form, so all {{descriptions}} of her are different. The form she's fought in looks like a human that has three red metallic wings and three blue wings similar to tails. This is her true form, {{and the fact that it}} is her true form is the reason she attacked the main characters, so they couldn't go out and tell everyone <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> She's also enveloped in a black cloud during a few of her attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Lee is {{a talented}} and famous woman in Hong Kong, {{but she has}} never {{appeared}} in public. Although her fans are curious about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> Lee insisted not to publish anything with her photography, family background and experience in it. Lee explained," [...] I am an ordinary people with unremarkable appearance. Please do not be curious about what I look like. I {{do not want to}} know how influential I am or what my fans' preferences are, so that I can write my works without any concern and keep the distance from [...] "the realistic world". Lee is always calm, humorous, with an imperturbable self-possession.|$|E

Throughout the novel, she discovers what is truly important in life and realizes popularity does not bring happiness. She begins to value herself for more than just <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} Euchre set off with Duane, {{and soon they}} reached Bland's cabin. Duane remembered it as the one where {{he had seen the}} pretty woman watching him ride by. He could not recall <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> The cabin was the same as the other adobe structures in the valley, but it was larger and pleasantly located rather high up in a grove of cottonwoods. In the windows and upon the porch were evidences of a woman's hand. Through the open door Duane caught a glimpse of bright Mexican blankets and rugs.|$|R
5000|$|On July 5, 1898, Arlington {{appeared}} {{briefly with}} the Reading Coal Heavers of the Atlantic League in a regulation Minor league {{game against the}} Allentown Peanuts.

Lizzie entered the grounds in a [...] "stylish carriage drawn by two white horses" [...] and, responding to applause by lifting her cap, revealed her hair done in the latest fashion. She wore black stockings and a gray uniform with knee-length skirt.|$|R

Lena was so ugly that anyone who saw her was immediately driven mad. No sane person, therefore, could tell you <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> After weeks of teasing his readers by hiding Lenas face behind [...] "censored" [...] stickers and strategically placed dialogue balloons, Capp invited fans to draw Lena in a famous nationwide contest in 1946. Lena was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, Boris Karloff and Salvador Dalí) drawn by noted cartoonist Basil Wolverton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{navy blue}} Guy Laroche dress of Hilary Swank {{refers to the}} navy blue backless Guy Laroche dress worn by Hilary Swank at the 77th Academy Awards on February 27, 2005. In a poll by Debenhams {{published}} in The Daily Telegraph the dress was voted the 16th greatest red carpet gown of all time. Cosmopolitan magazine cited the dress {{as one of the}} Best Oscar dresses of all time, saying, [...] "Making a serious comeback from that pink gauze number two years before, Hilary shows off her flawless back in this stunning sapphire gown by Guy Laroche.

5000|$|Two former {{students}} come to visit Professor Dayton and meet his fiancee, Kathy. Having been victims of his practical jokes in the past, they suspect that Kathy is actually a robot, which the professor has supposedly spent the last 20 years working on in his laboratory. She also behaves like a robot and does not eat or drink, which further indicates that she is probably mechanical. When the professor {{is out of the}} house, they decide to dismantle Kathy to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> on the inside. To their utter horror, they learn that Kathy really was a human being after all.

5000|$|In the present, having {{managed to}} piece {{together}} everything about Clara except <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> the Doctor finishes telling his story to the waitress, who encourages him to keep going. She then goes to a back room, revealing Ashildr and the TARDIS console. The diner {{is in fact the}} new TARDIS the Doctor stole, and the waitress is Clara. The restaurant-TARDIS departs, leaving the Doctor behind and revealing his own TARDIS, still covered with Rigsy's painted tribute to Clara ("Face the Raven") which includes her portrait. Ashildr reports that the chameleon circuit isn't working, so their TARDIS is stuck {{in the form of an}} American diner. Clara declares her intent to return to Gallifrey to die and restore the timeline, as her death is a fixed point in time. But since she is now ageless, she decides to [...] "take the long way around" [...] and sets off with Ashildr to travel the universe.|$|E
50|$|The July 2006 {{issue of}} Playboy {{featured}} the first formal nude photos of Guerra. Part of her motivation for posing for the magazine, she said, was the camera phone incident; she {{wanted people to}} see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> really <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> naked.|$|R
40|$|A quarrel in {{the pages}} of the {{literary}} review Le D&eacute;cadent in 1888 recalls the often belligerent existence of Gis&egrave;le d'Estoc, a shadowy figure who stalks the margins of the decadent period and whose life beyond the pages of specialized reviews has long presented something of a mystery. Who was <b>she,</b> and <b>what</b> did <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> The first question proves the easiest to answer. Tied intimately - by love, by hatred, or by both - to numerous figures of the French decadent movement (L&eacute;o Pillard d'Arka&iuml;, Laurent Tailhade, Rachilde), d'Estoc's real name was Marie-Paul Alice Courbe Desbarres. In addition to being the lover of Guy de Maupassant, and of being accused of planting a bomb at the Foyot Restaurant, d'Estoc had an independent career as an artist before launching her literary career in the 1880 s. It proves more difficult to know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> even though <b>she</b> was often represented in paintings, drawings, and photographs. This article analyses some of these representations in order to understand why it is sometimes so difficult to see the decadent woman even when she emerges from the shadows of literary history...|$|R
