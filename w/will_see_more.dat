25|$|The {{next step}} in the {{terminal}} replacement process is for the Airport Authority to finalize the new terminal's design, get FAA approval and then secure the required financing from the FAA and other sources. Airport funding sources include FAA grants, parking fees, landing fees charged to airlines, as well as rents from restaurants and other concession businesses operating at the airport. There are also fees charged on airline tickets sold, including passenger facility charges and federal taxes. Once the funding is nailed down, the Airport Authority will bid for the project. The replacement terminal is expected to encompass 355,000 square feet and the same number of gates (14). Also, air travelers <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> restrooms, additional restaurant and concession space, improved security screening areas and other enhanced passenger amenities.|$|E

[...] We wish to see the terminal continue as an airport as part of our ambitious plans for revitalising the whole area. [...] This deal <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> jobs, it will save the council money and it protects the employment of people already there." ...|$|E

60|$|Then that upright rock {{underneath}} {{is part of}} {{the great}} limestone hill above.

60|$|Go, my reader, if {{the day is}} dull, and {{you feel}} {{inclined}} to moralize-- for whatever {{may be said to}} the contrary, there are less useful occupations--and look at your village churchyard. What do you see before you? A plot of enclosed ground backed by a grey old church, a number of tombstones more or less decrepit, and a great quantity of little oblong mounds covered with rank grass. If you have any imagination, any power of thought, you <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> than that. First, with the instinctive selfishness of human nature, you will recognize your own future habitation; perhaps your eye will mark the identical spot where the body you love must lie through all seasons and weathers, through the slow centuries that will flit so fast for you, till the crash of doom. It is good that you should think of that, although it makes you shudder. The English churchyard takes the place of the Egyptian mummy at the feast, or the slave in the Roman conqueror's car--it mocks your vigour, and whispers of the end of beauty and strength.|$|E
