25|$|Having had {{a lengthy}} {{association}} with the criminal organisation known as The Firm, Den's involvement escalates over the summer of 1988. He hands over the tenancy of the Vic to Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) and takes over Strokes <b>wine</b> <b>bar,</b> which he runs with Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem). The <b>wine</b> <b>bar</b> is merely a front to the Firm's illegal gambling den. When Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) is raped by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), Den manipulates a Firm member, Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), to burn down The Dagmar (Wilmott-Brown's <b>wine</b> <b>bar)</b> in revenge, but this is against the Firm's wishes so when the police investigation starts suspecting the Firm's involvement and what the Strokes <b>wine</b> <b>bar</b> is really used for, The Firm's bosses force Den to take {{the blame for the}} arson in order to distance their organisation from the attack. They take Den to a safe house in Manchester, promising to alter his identity, but Den realises this is a cover and that the Firm are planning to kill him. Den escapes and hands himself in to the police to save his life and is remanded in custody in September 1988 at Dickens Hill prison.|$|E

Upstairs, in the same building, The Scotch Malt Whisky Society (iv) has its restaurant.

There were concerns that the sale of alcohol, pork, or tobacco as well as businesses such as gambling, hotels, movie theaters, and nude entertainment would also be prohibited. The Hines-Archstone group said it had never intended to allow banks, gambling, or liquor stores, and although it was seeking a <b>wine</b> <b>bar</b> (or similar business) as a tenant. The Hines-Archstone group also stated that restaurants would be able to serve liquor, but {{that it would not be}} seeking tenants such as liquor stores whose primary business was the sale of alcohol.
