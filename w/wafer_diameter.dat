The dot layer was grown without rotation of the substrate in order to achieve a gradual variation of the In concentration along the <b>wafer</b> <b>diameter.</b> This resulted in an increase in the density of quantum dots along the In concentration gradient, which is reflected in a characteristic dependence of the relative intensities of the spectral lines. A consistent assignment of the optical structure observed in all spectra leads to an estimate of the average value of the Fermi energy in the conduction band of the wetting layer (E(F) similar or equal to 13. 4 meV). The variation of this Fermi energy along the composition gradient can be obtained from the spectra, and an estimate of the gradient of the density of quantum dots along this direction can be made. A careful comparison of the variation of the critical energy of the different lines suggests that the average quantum dot size depends on the In molar fraction of the alloy, which is seen to vary more or less linearly across the <b>wafer</b> <b>diameter.</b> (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.
