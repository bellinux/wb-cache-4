25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to even speak to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say the <b>wrong</b> <b>things.</b> On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E

[...] "Unfortunately," [...] he said, [...] "we’ve had these {{instances}} where guys kill {{people because of}} what they hear in rock ‘n roll lyrics or some garbage like that. Look, if you’re going to blame a movie or song for your actions, whether they be good or bad, I think you’re looking at the <b>wrong</b> <b>things</b> to influence your life. I think people should look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance, mainly parents, or teachers, or friends, or whomever. That should probably be where you should point your eyes and ears." ...|$|E

[...] "You're told you're worth nothing," [...] he said. Heldal-Lund stated that, [...] "thousands of desperate parents contact me because they have children who have had major mental problems, or taken their own life after similar circumstances to Kaja Ballo". Scientology-associated celebrity, Hank Von Helvete, commented to the press that he thought psychiatry, not Scientology, {{was the cause of}} Ballo's suicide. TV 2 reported that psychologists advised that subsequent to the personality test, there should be proper follow-up attention with the subject. In an analysis of personality tests available online on social networking sites, Norwegian Psychological Association department advisor Andreas Høstmælingen cited Kaja Ballo as [...] "an example of how <b>wrong</b> <b>things</b> can go". The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.|$|E

500|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway in 1940 led to Andersen's life once more taking a turn into illegal activities. His furniture workshop {{was used as}} a weapons depot by the Norwegian resistance movement, and he took part in looting German military stores. He was first arrested by the Germans after he had responded to rumours that he was a Nazi by writing the Norwegian national socialist party Nasjonal Samling's official publication Fritt Folk and stating that [...] "although I have done many <b>wrong</b> <b>things</b> in my life, a Nazi I am not. Yours sincerely Johs. S. Andersen". The letter was published unedited by the newspaper, although Andersen was later arrested by the occupying authorities and sentenced to one year in prison, after spending half a year in detention. Using techniques he had learned during his earlier criminal career, Andersen managed to be transferred to prison hospital during his time in detention. While there he acquired false x-ray images and tuberculosis germs to fake illnesses in other captured resistance men who {{were on their way to}} interrogation. He also infected a German interrogator with malaria by contaminating his insulin. At night, he would sneak out of the hospital and operate in Oslo, amongst other activities breaking into Nasjonal Samling offices and stealing documents, copying them and having them shipped to the United Kingdom together with evidence of torture in Nazi-run prisons. He served the last part of his sentence in Fuhlsbüttel near Hamburg, Germany. [...] His wife was also active in resistance work, dealing with propaganda and espionage. Author Egil Ulateig doubts the veracity of Andersen's prison exploits, which are based mostly on Andersen's own testimony.|$|E
500|$|Kalpavriksha, {{the tree}} of life, also meaning [...] "World Tree" [...] finds mention in the Vedic scriptures. In the {{earliest}} account of the Samudra manthan or [...] "churning of the ocean of milk" [...] Kalpavriksha emerged from the primal waters during the ocean churning process along with Kamadhenu, the divine cow that bestows all needs. The tree is also {{said to be the}} Milky way or the birthplace of the stars Sirius. The king of the gods, Indra returned with this Kalpavriksha to his abode, the paradise and planted it there. Tree also finds mention in the Sanskrit text Mānāsara, part of Shilpa Shastras.Another myth says that Kalpavriksha was located on earth and was transported to Indra's abode after people started misusing it by wishing evil and <b>wrong</b> <b>things.</b> [...] In Indra's [...] "Devaloka" [...] it is said that there are five Kalpavrikshas, which are called Mandana, Parijata, Santana, Kalpavriksha and Harichandana, all of which fulfill various wishes. Kalpavriksha, in particular, is said to be planted at Mt. Meru peak in the middle of Indra's five paradise gardens. It is on account of these wish-granting trees that the asuras waged a perpetual war with the devas as the heavenly gods who exclusively benefited freely from the [...] "divine flowers and fruits" [...] from the Kalpavriksha, whereas the demigods lived comparatively in penury at the lower part of its [...] "trunk and roots". The Parijata is often identified with its terrestrial [...] counterpart, the Indian coral tree (Eyrthrina indica), but is most often depicted like a magnolia or frangipani (Sanskrit: champaka) tree. It is described as having roots made of gold, a silver midriff, lapislazuli boughs, coral leaves, pearl flower, gemstone buds, and diamond fruit. It is also said that Ashokasundari was created from a Kalpavriksha tree to provide relief to Parvati from her loneliness.|$|E

Yama, ruler of the underworld, dispatches demons to take her, and she lies to them and to her son, saying that she has not eaten meat or done <b>wrong</b> <b>things.</b> The demons then take her away.|$|E

[...] Politically, Baker has expressed disdain for both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, saying in 1998: [...] "When the Conservatives were in I cannot {{tell you how much}} I hated them.

2500|$|Oliver was criticised for underestimating {{the cost}} of {{supposedly}} cheap food he encouraged poor people to prepare for themselves, also for an unrealistic view of poverty in Britain and round the Mediterranean. Cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe stated that Oliver's comments [...] "support damaging myths that poor people are only poor because they spend their money on the <b>wrong</b> <b>things,</b> rather than being constrained by time, equipment, knowledge or practicalities". Monroe added, [...] "When I was living on £10 a week for food, because of mistakes with housing benefit payments, I didn't need a hug. I needed a fiver, {{just to have a}} little bit more to eat. I didn't need [...] to Sicily to see how the street cleaners ate, I needed someone {{to point out that the}} 21p can of kidney beans could be the staple ingredient in a nutritious meal.

2500|$|Upon its release, Talk Dirty {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At USA Today, Martin Caballero rated the album {{two out of}} four stars, stating that Derulo is [...] "wallow in familiar sexed-up tropes, both lyrically and musically, that aren't distinctive enough to ultimately prove memorable." [...] Caballero continued saying [...] "Talk Dirty sounds like Macklemore's Thrift Shop on Red Bull and Viagra". Brent Faulkner of StarPulse.com rated the album three out of five stars, stating that the album heavily relies on sex and swagger holds the album back at times. Faulkner went on to summarize the album as [...] "average at best" [...] stating [...] " [...] seems to put its eggs too much into one basket – specifically booty. Much like Derülo’s Future History, Talk Dirty seems to lack cohesion; it’s missing something". Glenn Gamboa at Newsday graded the album a C, saying that Derulo [...] "tries too hard at the <b>wrong</b> <b>things...</b> cornering the market on sex-themed pop songs." [...] in closing Gambo called Talk Dirty a [...] "sex-obsessed album that isn't very sexy".|$|E
2500|$|An adolescent's {{environment}} plays a huge role {{in their}} identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, {{studies show that the}} more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case {{during the middle of the}} 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. [...] So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. [...] Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the <b>wrong</b> <b>things</b> at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. [...] While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.|$|E
