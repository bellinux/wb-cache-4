5|$|On May 21, 2013, Bill Peduto won the Democratic {{primary and}} Josh Wander, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> unopposed in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. Peduto {{defeated}} Wander and independent Lester Ludwig in the November general election. He was inaugurated as Pittsburgh's 60th mayor upon the expiration of incumbent Mayor Luke Ravenstahl's term in January 2014. The next regular quadrennial mayoral election following the 2013 election {{is scheduled for}} November 2017.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} to not feature {{either of the two}} previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds. Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} did {{not find}} anyone guilty of negligence or misconduct, but Lieutenant Admiral Bär, commander of Nyckeln, and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> aground on Äpplet, were never again given a command in the navy. Lieutenant Admiral Hans Clerck, commander of Solen, went through the process unscathed, and was promoted to full Admiral by the King before the commission even presented its verdict. Creutz has quite consistently been blamed {{for the loss of}} his ship by historians, and has been described as an incompetent sea officer and sailor who more or less single-handedly brought about the sinking through lack of naval experience. Military historians Lars Ericson Wolke and Olof Sjöblom have attempted to nuance the picture by pointing out that Creutz's task was akin to that of an administrator rather than a military commander. The practical issues of ship maneuvering should have been the responsibility of his subordinates, who had experience in naval matters.|$|E
5|$|The {{final game}} was also held at Gillette Stadium and {{took place on}} Memorial Day, May 25. Cornell {{controlled}} the tempo of the game for the first 56 minutes and frustrated Syracuse with a tough defense. Late in the fourth quarter, the Big Red led, 9–6, before Syracuse's Stephen Keogh and Cody Jamieson narrowed the deficit to one goal with 2:46 remaining. Keogh attempted another shot but missed, and Cornell took possession with 27.6seconds left to play. The Orange's Kenny Nims then dislodged the ball from Matt Moyer, and Keogh recovered possession. He took a wild shot, which was caught by Syracuse's Matt Abbott. As he was flattened by Cornell defenders, Abbott got off a pass to Nims, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> from midfield to {{the very edge of}} the crease. Nims connected with his shot on goal to send the game into overtime. Cornell won the overtime faceoff, but Syracuse defenseman Sid Smith stripped Ryan Hurley to create a turnover. Dan Hardy feigned a shot before passing to Jamieson, positioned just beyond the crease, who scored the game-winner.|$|E
5|$|Turmoil in the mayor's office also {{weakened}} the Birmingham city government in {{its opposition to}} the campaign. Connor, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> for several elected offices {{in the months leading}} up to the campaign, had lost all but the race for Public Safety Commissioner. Because they believed Connor's extreme conservatism slowed progress for the city as a whole, a group of white political moderates worked to defeat him. The Citizens for Progress was backed by the Chamber of Commerce and other white professionals in the city, and their tactics were successful. In November 1962, Connor lost the race for mayor to Albert Boutwell, a less combative segregationist. However, Connor and his colleagues on the City Commission refused to accept the new mayor's authority. They claimed on a technicality that their terms would not expire until 1965 instead of in the spring of 1963. So for a brief time, Birmingham had two city governments attempting to conduct business.|$|E
