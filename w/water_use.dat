5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating {{solar plants}} in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> because concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems have high water-consumption intensities {{compared}} to other types of electric power plants; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210). A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.|$|E

The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E

5|$|Today, the Klamath is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} river {{as well as an}} important source of water for agriculture. It includes many of the longest free-flowing stretches of river in California, including excellent stretches of whitewater.

Environmental groups and native tribes have proposed broad changes to <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in the Klamath Basin, including the removal of some dams on the river to expand fish habitat. They put forth their concerns in what is now the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement, a water management plan signed by local communities, governments, tribal groups, environmentalists, and fishermen.

5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{decoupling}} elasticity model, {{this paper}} studies the decoupling relationships (DRs) of total <b>water</b> <b>uses</b> (TWU) and provincial GDP, agricultural <b>water</b> <b>uses</b> (AWU) and agricultural added value (AAV), {{as well as}} industrial <b>water</b> <b>uses</b> (IWU) and industrial added value (IAV) respectively in Yunnan and Guizhou during the first ten years {{for the implementation of}} the Great Western Development Strategy. The results indicate that the DRs of <b>water</b> <b>uses</b> and economic development are highly undesirable in both provinces. Among the three groups, the DRs of AWU and AAV are the worst of all, with strong or weak coupling in 5 of the 10 years; the DRs of IWU and IAV are slightly better with strong coupling respectively in 3 of the 10 years in Yunnan and in 2 of the 10 years in Guizhou; and the DRs of TWU and GDP are the best, with strong or weak decoupling in 7 of the 10 years in both provinces. The DRs have improved in the period of 2006 - 2010 if compared with that in the period of 2001 - 2005. It is concluded that slow economic growth, low efficiency and poor structure of <b>water</b> <b>uses</b> are the main reasons for the worse status of DRs, and the development of economy and <b>water</b> <b>uses</b> efficiency promotes the DRs getting better...|$|R
25|$|Just like data {{on water}} availability, {{publicly}} available data on <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in Greater Damascus are contradictory and outdated. In 2001 <b>water</b> <b>use</b> {{has been estimated}} at between 1,350 and 1,700 million cubic metres per year. This includes <b>water</b> <b>use</b> for irrigation that was estimated at between 920 and more than 1,200 million cubic metres per year, accounting for 68% and 76% of total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in the basin. Domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> was estimated at between 300 and 390 million cubic metres per year. The lower bound of this estimate is probably more realistic and is equivalent {{to an average of}} about 220 liter/capita/day before distribution losses for a population connected to the network of about 3.75 million. Taking into account non-revenue water of about 50%, this corresponds to about 110 liter/capita/day which is about as much as domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in Germany. However, during summer water availability and thus <b>water</b> <b>use</b> drop significantly. For example, in the summer of 2001 the city received 317,000 cubic meter per day, corresponding to about 85 liter/capita/day before losses and 43 liter/capita/day after losses.|$|E
