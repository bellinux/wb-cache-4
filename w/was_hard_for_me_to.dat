500|$|Apple Records issued [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on 16 April 1971 in Britain (as Apple 33), {{and three}} days later in America (as Apple 1832). Apple's print {{advertisement}} for the release carried the simple tagline: [...] "A New Single". Among the interviews she gave to the UK music press, Ronnie Spector admitted to Symes that {{it took a long}} time to learn the song [...] "as it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> understand", but she added: [...] "I love the record. It's completely different for me; it's more of a music thing than vocal." [...] In America, Billboard magazine's reviewer described [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] as a [...] "powerful production ballad" [...] that had [...] "all the ingredients to break through big", while suggesting that Ringo Starr and Eric Clapton had contributed to the recording.|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E

2500|$|When {{she heard}} that Danes was no longer keen to {{continue}} with the show, Holzman's attitude changed as well. She said, [...] "When I realized that Claire truly did not want to do it any more, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> want to do it. The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end {{at a time when we}} all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear dad! How {{could you}} {{possibly}} know? As {{he says in his}} letter, it has given me a lesson. But he was so much older and so much more experienced, that it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ask to examine his books. But we must waste no time. I must go to the City." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{we had a}} carriage, yes, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get about. I had to {{be helped}} by the {{conductors}} into the streetcars. I broke my hip when we lived in Steelville, and the doctor was a numbskull. He should be put in prison, is what I tell Adolf. I was standing on a clothes-horse, when it fell. I had much washing to do in those days." ...|$|E

After a time, {{he began to}} write to me, urging me to change my decision; and from this, {{although}} he never said so, I was sure that you had refused to sanction his marriage.

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> adjust {{myself to}} his sorrowful decline into old age. I {{thought of him}} as he {{appeared}} to me when riding his threshing machine up the coulee road. I recalled the long rifle with which he used to carry off the prizes at the turkey shoots, and especially I remembered him as he looked while playing the violin on that far off Thanksgiving night in Lewis Valley.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{lie there}} with a dry {{moustache}} and watch the great flagons which were brought out by the landlord to these English officers. But it amused {{me to look at}} their fresh-coloured, clean-shaven, careless faces, and to wonder what they would think if they knew that so celebrated a person was lying so near to them. And then, as I lay and watched, I saw a sight which filled me with surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] she {{answered}} in a very low voice. [...] "But, Tom, you must know that it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write you that letter, {{and that it has}} been harder still to make this confession. Can't you see what I mean? Well, I mean that I find it very refreshing to have a good talk with you. I hope {{you are not going to}} disappear into space again as soon as our conversation is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bostil, I'm sorry I can't {{take you}} up on the job," [...] rejoined Slone, swiftly. [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to decide. You've been good to me. I'm grateful. But it's time I was tellin' you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to advise}} you, Henry," [...] said Simon; [...] "but this I must ask you: Have you, {{or have you}} not, {{reason to think that}} this poor unfortunate Oliver has been mistaken for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MARGARET (hugging his arm). It would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> if {{you lost}} me, {{but it would}} be worse for you. I don't know how I know that, but I do know it. What would you do without me? ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{realize that}} this bent, bearded, grizzled mountaineer was Burt Babcock, the slim {{companion}} of my Dry Run Prairie boyhood--it was only in peculiar ways of laughter, and in a certain familiar pucker of wrinkles about his eyes, that I traced the connecting link. I must assume that he found in me something quite as alien--perhaps more so, for my life in Boston and New York had given to me habits of speech and of thought which obscured, no doubt, most of my youthful characteristics.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ellen," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am afraid}} I can't make you understand. It {{is true that}} I shall {{probably}} be rich, but I hate the thought of it. I only {{want to be left}} alone. I have made a mistake, and yet, Heaven knows, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> escape! Before very long," [...] he added, his voice sinking a little lower, [...] "it is quite likely that you will recognize me again completely. I dare say then I shall be very glad to go to the theatre with you and to meet the Johnsons. Just now I--I can't." ...|$|E
60|$|Wild as it was, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of}} the {{associations}} of the settlements. Any steady and monotonous sound, to which I did not distinctly attend, passed for a sound of human industry. The waterfalls which I heard were not without their dams and mills to my imagination; and several times I found that I had been regarding the steady rushing sound of the wind from over the woods beyond the rivers as that of a train of cars. Our minds anywhere, when left to themselves, are always thus busily drawing conclusions from false premises.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2011 Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, he said: [...] "You don't {{need to be}} a {{computer}} scientist to use a Windows Phone and you do to use an Android phone ... It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to <b>be</b> excited about the Android phones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have not}} pity. I told you then how sorry I {{was that a}} sudden {{uncontrollable}} pain drove me to do a thing which immediately I bitterly regretted. Don't you think it must have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> under the actual circumstances, to confess my fault?' ...|$|R
5000|$|The public {{perception}} of what Michael is {{as a human being}} has been highly exaggerated. Those articles <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to relate to. For instance, Bubbles is more fun than a lot of people I know. I saw Bubbles at a wedding in a tux. He has great table manners. Quincy Jones.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps it {{was this}} same year {{that one of the}} men {{discovered}} another enormous yellow-back in the barnyard, one of the largest ever seen on the farm--and killed it just as it was moving across an old barrel. I cannot now understand why it tried to cross the barrel, but I distinctly visualize the brown and yellow band it made as it lay for an instant just before the bludgeon fell upon it, crushing it and the barrel together. He was thicker than my leg and glistened in the sun with sinister splendor. As he hung limp over the fence, a warning to his fellows, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> realize that death still lay in his square jaws and poisonous fangs.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now I {{was left}} with a {{difficult}} point to settle, for it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say whether it was better that I should do that which I had come for, or whether, by holding this man's guilty secret, I might not have in my hand a keener and more deadly weapon than my master's hunting-knife. I was sure that Lord Avon could not and would not expose him. I knew your sense of family pride too well, my lord, and I was certain that his secret was safe in your hands. But I both could and would; and then, when his life had been blasted, {{and he had been}} hounded from his regiment and from his clubs, it would be time, perhaps, for me to deal in some other way with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which {{is the big}} thing," [...] Mrs. Tully {{accepted}} with a {{smile of}} enthusiasm. [...] "She is a splendid, unusual woman, very unspoiled, very natural. And after all, what does doing things amount to? I'd give more for one of Paula's madcap escapades--oh, I heard all about swimming the big stallion--than for all her pictures if every one was a masterpiece. But she <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> understand at first. Dick often calls her the girl that never grew up. But gracious, she can put on the grand air when she needs to. I call her the most mature child I have ever seen. Dick was the finest {{thing that ever happened}} to her. It was then that she really seemed for the first time to find herself. It was this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know any}} reason why you shouldn't," [...] confessed Peter. [...] "But somehow it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to think of birds as living in holes in the ground. I've only just found out that Rattles the Kingfisher does. But I didn't suppose there were any others. Did you make that hole yourself, Banker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do so, and I {{will show}} you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it <b>is</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to say and for you to hear: {{there has been an}} {{understanding}} between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary.
