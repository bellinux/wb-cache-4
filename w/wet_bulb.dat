Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. <b>Wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account.

25|$|Global warming of that {{magnitude}} {{would make}} {{most of the}} planet uninhabitable by humans. The human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37°C, which implies that sustained <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperatures above 35°C can result in lethal hyperthermia. Today, the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth's surface, but <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature is more narrowly confined by the effect of humidity, with the most common value of approximately 26–27°C and the highest approximately of 31°C. A warming of 10–12°C would put most of today's world population in regions with a wetbulb temperature above 35°C. Given the 20°C warming that occurs with 4.8 times current CO2 levels, such a climate forcing would produce intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is significantly less than the Russell sensitivity, or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO2 forcing required to produce intolerable conditions for humans is less than this amount.|$|E

This study has been conducted in Albaji region in km 25 on the Ahvaz-Andimeshk road, in order to estimate the geometry of the wetting pattern under the point source trickle emitters in sandy soil with different discharge. The emitters were calibrated to provide 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 liter per hour discharges. The maximum wetted soil surface and depth was measured by digging the irrigated soil.

40|$|International audiencePredicting soil {{hydraulic}} {{properties and}} understanding their temporal variability during the irrigated cropping season {{are required to}} mitigate agro-environmental risks. This paper reports field measurements of soil hydraulic properties under two drip irrigation treatments, full (FT) and limited (LT). The objective was to identify the temporal variability of the hydraulic properties of field soil under high-frequency water application during a maize cropping season. Soil hydraulics were characterized using the Beerkan infiltration method. Seven sets of infiltration measurements were taken for each irrigation treatment during the cropping season between June and September 2007. The first set was measured {{two weeks before the}} first irrigation event. The results demonstrated that both soil porosity and hydraulic properties changed over time. These temporal changes occurred in two distinct stages. The first stage lasted from the first irrigation event until the root system was well established. During this stage, soil porosity was significantly affected by the first irrigation event, resulting in a decrease in both the saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks and the mean pore effective radius ξm and in an increase in capillary length αh. These hydraulic parameters reached their extreme values {{at the end of this}} stage. This behavior was explained by the “hydraulic” compaction of the surface soil following irrigation. During the second stage, there was a gradual increase in both Ks and ξm and a gradual decrease in αh when the effect of irrigation was overtaken by other phenomena. The latter was put down to the effects of wetting and drying cycles, soil biological activity and the effects of the root system, which could be asymmetric as a result of irrigation with only one drip line installed for every two plant rows. The processes that affected soil hydraulic properties in the two irrigation treatments were similar. No significant change in ξm and αh was observed between FT and LT. However, as a result of daily wetting and drying cycles, which were strongest in LT, the soil in this treatment was found to be more conductive than that of FT. This showed that most of the changes in pore-size distribution occurred in the larger fraction of pores. The impact of these temporal changes on the dimensions of the <b>wetting</b> <b>bulb</b> was studied using a simplified modeling approach. Our results showed that there were marked differences in the computed width and depth of <b>wetting</b> <b>bulb</b> when model input parameters measured before and after irrigation were used. A temporal increase in capillary length led to a more horizontally elongated <b>wetting</b> <b>bulb.</b> This could improve both watering and fertilization of the root zone and reduce losses due to deep percolation. As a practical result of this study, in order to mitigate agro-environmental risks we recommend applying fertilizers after the restructuration of tilled soil. Further studies using improved models accounting for temporal changes in soil hydraulic properties are needed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} approach for predicting the wetted soil volume underneath an emitter {{laid on the}} ground surface is developed. The approach is based on: (1) the Green and Ampt assumption, (2) Hammami et al. model that enables the inference of the wetted soil depth from the radius of the humid area at the ground surface and (3) {{the hypothesis that the}} bulb keeps a semi-elliptical shape whose diagonals are merged with the soil surface and the symmetry axis, respectively. Knowing the initial water content θi, the soil hydraulic conductivity Kf and the water content θf at wetting front position, the proposed approach allows the inference of the <b>wetted</b> <b>bulb</b> volume from the radius of the wetted spot at the soil surface. Experimental trials were carried out in laboratory conditions to assess the relevance of the proposed method. The measurements were made during the infiltration process in three soil types: loamy clay, sandy clay loam and sandy clay. The wetting front progression was monitored via the measurement of the wetting front radius Rf(t) at the soil surface and the determination of the moistened bulb volume Vb(t) by water balance equation. The Vb(t) values thus determined were compared to those predicted by the present approach. The results exhibit a good agreement between calculated and predicted data.
