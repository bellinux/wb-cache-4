5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, <b>when</b> <b>state</b> legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{economic}} times marked Brown's term in office. During his tenure, the state's unemployment rate climbed from 5.6 percent to 11.7 percent. Brown {{stuck to his}} campaign promise not to raise taxes. <b>When</b> <b>state</b> income fell short of expectations, he reduced the state budget by 22 percent and {{cut the number of}} state employees from 37,241 to 30,783, mostly through transfer and attrition. At the same time, his merit pay policies increased salaries for the remaining employees by an average of 34 percent. He cut the executive office staff from ninety-seven to thirty, and sold seven of the state's eight government airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena {{on what is}} now NY420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route32 continued west on modern NY37 to Waddington. <b>When</b> <b>state</b> highways in New York were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY3, a highway extending across {{the width of the}} state.|$|E

In later years the Silver Street and Broad Street schools operated as St Mary's Junior School. The Ely High School for Girls opened in 1905 in St. Mary's Street, moving to the Downham Road site in 1957.

5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts {{to open the}} third quarter, the Bulldogs {{sustained}} their longest drive of the game. They drove 97 yards in 16 plays, but Tyler Russell threw a pass that was intercepted by Robert Lester in the endzone for a touchback that halted the drive. On the Alabama drive that ensued, State managed to force a punt, however it was fumbled by Deontae Skinner that gave the Crimson Tide possession at the Bulldogs' 28-yard line {{early in the fourth}} quarter. Three plays later, Phillip Ely threw his first career touchdown pass to Eddie Lacy from 27 yards for a 31–0 Alabama lead. On the kickoff that ensued, Christion Jones forced a Jameon Lewis fumble that was recovered by Landon Collins at the State 43-yard line, and eight plays later Alabama led 38–0 on a three-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run. With the Crimson Tide reserves in on defense, the Bulldogs did manage to break up the shutout bid late in the fourth quarter <b>when</b> <b>State</b> scored their lone points on a two-yard Dak Prescott touchdown pass to Robert Johnson and made the final score 38–7. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 75–18–3 (77–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|In 1924, <b>when</b> <b>state</b> {{highways}} {{were first}} marked by route numbers in New York, {{the main line}} of the Dutchess Turnpike was designated as NY21. Other portions of modern US44, aside from the overlap with NY22, were unnumbered in the 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the old NY21 was partitioned into three numbered routes. Between Poughkeepsie and South Millbrook, old NY21 became the western half of NY200, which continued east to Dover Plains using the Dover branch route of the Dutchess Turnpike (modern NY343). The section from South Millbrook to Amenia became part of NY82A, which continued past Amenia to Pine Plains. The easternmost section from Amenia to the Connecticut line was designated as NY343. West of the Hudson River, NY55 was also designated in 1930 between Barryville and Pawling, running along the portion of modern US44 between Kerhonkson and Poughkeepsie.|$|E
5|$|In Bloemfontein Spruyt {{worked as}} clerk of the Landdrost (1854–1855), {{and in that}} {{capacity}} he acted {{as secretary of the}} Volksraad on two occasions (September 1854 and February 1855), also filling in as Government Secretary. On the strength of his capacities Spruyt was appointed clerk to the State President in September 1855. Soon after, during the illness of Government Secretary Groenendaal, Spruyt again took up that position. In October 1856 he was appointed to the vacancy and succeeded J. Groenendaal as Government Secretary of the Orange Free State. Spruyt was regarded by his colleagues as an accurate civil servant, but as a lesser politician and statesman, reason that he was not appointed Acting State President <b>when</b> <b>State</b> President Boshoff went on leave in 1858. However, Boshoff trusted Spruyt fully, and he allowed him to represent the presidency in meetings of the Volksraad on several occasions in 1861 and 1862.|$|E

5|$|Post-war Kentucky Democrats {{had split}} into two factions—the more {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and the more progressive New Departure Democrats. Stevenson governed moderately, giving concessions to both sides. He urged the immediate restoration of all rights to ex-Confederates and denounced Congress for failing to seat {{a portion of the}} Kentucky delegation because they had sided with the Confederacy. A champion of states' rights, he resisted federal measures he saw as violating the sovereignty of the states and vehemently denounced the proposed Fifteenth Amendment. Following Stevenson's lead, the General Assembly refused to pass either the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, but after their passage by a constitutional majority of the states Stevenson generally insisted that blacks' newly granted rights not be infringed upon. He was silent, however, <b>when</b> <b>state</b> legislators and officials from various cities used lengthy residency restrictions and redrawn district and municipal boundaries to exclude black voters from specific elections. His 1867 plea for legislators to call a constitutional convention to revise the state's pro-slavery constitution to better conform to post-war reality was completely ignored.|$|E
5|$|Reitz was {{a popular}} personality, both for his {{politics}} and his openness. <b>When</b> <b>State</b> President Brand suddenly died in 1888, Reitz won the presidential elections unopposed. After being re-elected in 1895, subsequently making a trip to Europe, Reitz fell seriously ill, and had to retire. In 1898, now recovered, he was appointed State Secretary of the South African Republic, and became a leading Afrikaner political figure during the Second Boer War. Reluctant to shift allegiance to the British, Reitz went into voluntary exile after the war ended. Several years later he returned to South Africa {{and set up a}} law practice again, in Pretoria. In the late 1900s he became involved in politics once more, and upon the declaration of the Union of South Africa in 1910, Reitz was chosen the first president of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>State</b> Arms of the Union was {{published}} in 1876, some existing arms were not included (e.g., Arizona and Washington Territory). At the time, Alaska was classified as the Department of Alaska (1867–84) and became the District of Alaska (1884–1912) before becoming the Territory of Alaska (1912–59). The Alaska territorial seal was designed in 1910 and adopted in 1913. On 3 January 1959 Alaska became the 49th U.S. State. The Oklahoma Territory (1890–1907) Organic Act was approved on 2 May 1890, and a territorial seal was adopted on 10 January 1893. Hawaii, formerly the Kingdom of Hawaii (1795–1893), Republic of Hawaii (1894–98), and then Territory of Hawaii (1898–1959) became the 50th U.S. State on 21 August 1959.
