5|$|<b>Water</b> <b>{{security}}</b> {{and food}} security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E

25|$|Water {{conservation}} {{is of the}} utmost importance in the Willow Bunch area because of the dry nature of the climate. Long term agricultural success is dependent on closely monitoring the local water supply. Underground aquifers {{are one of the most}} important water sources in the area, although many are too deep to drill wells into. This difficulty has led to the widespread use of irrigation. Willow Bunch's aquifers and groundwater flows are charted by the <b>Water</b> <b>Security</b> Agency for the purpose of monitoring and managing them.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Security {{evaluation}} {{has become}} a hot topic in the research field of water resource management. In this paper, we established a novel <b>water</b> resource <b>security</b> indicator system based on the Pressure-Status-Response (PSR) framework using gray relation analysis (GRA) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). A case study of Beijing from 1996 to 2007 was conducted to verify the evaluation system. Results showed that the gray relative closeness degrees of <b>water</b> resource <b>security</b> to the positive ideal solution were low, with the least one of 0. 360 in 1999 and the largest one of 0. 527 in 2007, implying that Beijing was facing severer challenges with water resources during the concerned time. Also, the analysis of <b>water</b> resource <b>security</b> indicated that the pressure of water resource was constantly increasing. Finally, factor analysis was employed to calculate the gray relation degrees of evaluating indices with the ideal solutions so as to reveal the relativity of <b>water</b> resource <b>security</b> of Beijing, which may contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the urban water resource management and regulation.

25|$|The Nationals SA is a {{sub-division}} of {{the conservative}} National Party of Australia (formerly the Country Party). First contesting the 1965 election, they have only held two seats: Flinders (1973–1993) and Chaffey (1997–2010). Former member Karlene Maywald, representing the Riverland district of Chaffey, accepted a cabinet position in 2004 {{as part of the}} Rann Labor government, as Minister for the River Murray, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Small Business, and later Minister for <b>Water</b> <b>Security.</b> This informal ALP-NAT coalition (the first since 1935) caused an uproar, with the federal Liberal member for the SA seat of Sturt, Christopher Pyne, calling for Maywald's expulsion from the Nationals, and Patrick Secker calling for a corruption enquiry into the appointment. Neither eventuated. As the Liberal Party in South Australia is descended from a historical merger from an earlier Country Party, the SA Nationals are not as dominant in rural areas as their eastern state counterparts.|$|E
25|$|From December 2006 to mid-September 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority met 36 times; {{there were}} also lower-level talks. In 2007 Olmert welcomed the Arab League's re-endorsement of the Arab Peace Initiative. In his bid to {{negotiate}} a peace accord and establish a Palestinian state, Olmert proposed a plan to the Palestinians. The centerpiece of Olmert's detailed proposal is the suggested permanent border, which {{would be based on}} an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank. Olmert proposed annexing at least 6.3% of Palestinian territory, in exchange for 5.8% of Israeli land, with Palestinians receiving alternative land in the Negev, adjacent to the Gaza Strip, as well as territorial link, under Israeli sovereignty, for free passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Israel insisted on retaining an armed presence in the future Palestinian state. Under Abbas's offer, more than 60 percent of settlers would stay in place. Olmert, for his part, was presenting a plan in which the most sparsely populated settlements would be evacuated. Olmert and Abbas both acknowledged that reciprocal relations would be necessary, not hermetic separation. They also acknowledged the need to share a single business ecosystem, while cooperating intensively on <b>water,</b> <b>security,</b> bandwidth, banking, tourism and much more. Regarding Jerusalem the leaders agreed that Jewish neighborhoods should remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Arab neighborhoods would revert to Palestinian sovereignty. The Palestinians asked for clarifications of the territorial land swap since they were unable to ascertain what land his percentages affected, since Israeli and Palestinian calculations of the West Bank differ by several hundred square kilometres. For them, in lieu of such clarifications, Olmert's 6.3–6.8% annexation might work out closer to 8.5%, 4 times the 1.9% limit the Palestinians argued a swap should not exceed. The talks ended with both sides claiming the other side dropped follow-up contacts.|$|E

2500|$|Acknowledging the {{changing}} security paradigm in Asia, the Indian Minister of State for Defence Rao Inderjit Singh, underscored {{the importance of}} national preparedness to efficiently accommodate challenges generated {{in the management of}} the global commons: [...] "New concepts like food security, energy security, <b>water</b> <b>security,</b> information security and security of navigation have emerged in strategic discourse. We have also come to look upon natural disasters and mass epidemics as security threats, as they can often disrupt our lives and societies much more dramatically than even military threats. These new and holistic conceptions of security have led to new forms of security cooperation between nations. Earlier, countries used to secure themselves from traditional military threats by adopting forms of neutrality or by aligning themselves in mutual defence arrangements with other countries. In our age, we have evolved a new form of security cooperation, one that is based on regular, structured dialogue between different nations rather than on formal alliances." ...|$|E
