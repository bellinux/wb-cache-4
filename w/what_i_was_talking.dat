500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about when I wrote it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day. That's when our marriage started breaking up. She never knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about, what I was thinking about, and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hussey {{joined the}} James Reyne Band {{and worked on}} Reyne's self-titled debut solo album (September 1987), co-writing six tracks with the artist. Four of these were issued as singles, [...] "Hammerhead" [...] (October), [...] "Heaven on a Stick" [...] (February 1988), [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] (June) and [...] "Always the Way" [...] (November). James later told Debbie Kruger that [...] " [...] was not {{necessarily}} about me, but let's say I thought I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about. I wrote it with Simon Hussey; the music Simon and I wrote together and I wrote the lyrics. From memory it seemed to come quite easily". The album peaked at No.4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, while [...] "Hammerhead" [...] reached No.8 and [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] at No.4 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart. [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] also reached No.6 on the ARIA Singles Chart.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{were nearly}} a minute insensible {{when you first}} fell, and when you {{recovered}} you only rested for about one second. After that you raved, and I invented suitable answers until you suddenly asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] I returned, [...] "you {{could tell}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about!" [...] For a moment after this we {{faced each other}} without more speech, but I {{presently}} continued: [...] "You didn't really notice if any lady stayed behind?" ...|$|E

[THOMAS is silent.] We know very well what we are--discontented dogs--never satisfied. What did the Chairman tell me up in London?

6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> about?" [...] he repeated, {{with his}} eyes fixed attentively, not on my mother-in-law, but on me.

6000|$|... 195. The {{only chance}} of my getting these letters {{themselves}} into fairly consistent and Museum-like order is by writing {{a word or}} two always the {{first thing in the morning}} till I get them done; so, I shall at least remember <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> of the day before; but for the rest--I must speak of one thing or another as it may come into my head, for there are too many to classify without pedantry and loss of time.|$|E
60|$|The event, even to me, {{was more}} inspiring in {{anticipation}} than in fulfillment, for when I rose {{to speak in}} the band-stand {{the wind was blowing}} hard, and other and less intellectual attractions were in full tide. My audience remained distressingly small--and calm. I have a dim recollection of howling into the face of the equatorical current certain disconnected sentences concerning my reform theory, and of seeing on the familiar faces of David Babcock, John Gammons and others of my bronzed and bent old neighbors a mild wonder as to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Blatherwick," [...] he said, [...] "don't be a fool! You {{ought to}} know that I am {{not the sort of}} man to make evil remarks about a lady behind her back, unless I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about. I cannot at this moment prove it, but I am morally {{convinced}} that Miss Merton came here to-day at the instigation of the person who wrote to you, and that she only refrained from making you some offer because she knew quite well that we were within hearing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank God that is off my mind!" [...] Andrew said. [...] "And I will off to bed, or Janet will wonder <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> {{about so}} long. I {{will leave you}} two to settle how you can best manage the affair, which you can do without my help, for matters of this kind are far more in your way than in mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> about, Squire Paget.

I told him that in theory a dry battery was just a curled darling and no mistake, but when it come to practice, sho!--and here's the result. Was I right? What should you say, Washington Hawkins? You've seen me try that button twice. Was I right?--that's the idea. Did I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about, or didn't I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|AMY. 'Of course. He behaved {{at first}} {{as they all}} do--pretended {{that he did not}} know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about.

6000|$|I gave up by going, decidedly, to the smoking-room, {{where several}} men had {{gathered}} and where Obert, a little apart from them, was in charmed communion with the bookshelves. They are wonderful, everywhere, at Newmarch, the bookshelves, but {{he put a}} volume back as he saw me come in, and a moment later, when we were seated, I said to him again, as a recall of our previous passage, [...] "Then you could tell <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about!" [...] And I added, to complete my reference, [...] "Since you thought Mrs. Server was the person whom, when I stopped you, I was sorry to learn from you I had missed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it is {{not more}} than twelve months since first they met in Italy. <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> about, and you need not {{contradict}} me.

6000|$|... "Force you?" [...] he repeated. [...] "Did I say that? <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> about; <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing. You <b>are</b> {{right and}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wrong. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a miserable wretch, Lucilla--I am utterly unworthy of you. It {{would be better}} for you if you never saw me again!" [...] He paused; and taking me by both hands, looked earnestly and sadly into my face. [...] "Good night, my dear!" [...] he said--and {{suddenly}} dropped my hands, and turned away to go out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait {{till they}} get around {{and up into}} better weather," [...] he {{astonished}} me by telling me the other afternoon. [...] "Wait till they get dried out, and rested up, with more sleep, and their sores healed, and more flesh on their bones, and more spunk in their blood--then they won't stand for this driving. Mr. Pike can't realize that times have changed, sir, and laws have changed, and men have changed. He's an old man, and <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> about." ...|$|R
60|$|DAN. Many--and {{so many of}} {{them have}} no answer. Why am I a useless, {{drifting}} log upon the world's tide? Why have all the young men passed me? Why am I, at thirty-nine, let us say, with brain, with power, with strength--nobody thinks I am worth anything, but I am--I know it. I might have been an able editor, devoting every morning from ten till three to arranging the affairs of the Universe, or a popular politician, trying to understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about, and to believe it. And what am I? A newspaper reporter, at three-ha'pence a line--I beg their pardon, its occasionally twopence.|$|E

He chuckled in a funny, dry way he had, and I called her. She knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about, the hussy, and I saw her {{out of the corner of}} my eyes {{listening}} with all her ears, while she pretended to iron a blouse that she had been washing for me. She came. She was laughing, but I could see that she was a little shy, and Strickland looked at her without speaking." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{only person}} of the {{smallest}} importance in the place was the priest, and to him I addressed my first inquiries, leaving Monkton to await my return with the guide. I spoke Italian quite fluently, and correctly enough for my purpose, and was extremely polite and cautious in introducing my business, {{but in spite of}} all the pains I took, I only succeeded in frightening and bewildering the poor priest more and more with every fresh word I said to him. The idea of a dueling-party and a dead man seemed to scare him out of his senses. He bowed, fidgeted, cast his eyes up to heaven, and piteously shrugging his shoulders, told me, with rapid Italian circumlocution, that he had not the faintest idea of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about. This was my first failure. I confess I was weak enough to feel a little dispirited when I rejoined Monkton and the guide.|$|E
6000|$|... 100. I {{have assumed}} {{throughout}} these papers, that everybody knew what Fiction meant; as Mr. Mill assumed in his Political Economy, that everybody knew what wealth meant. The assumption was convenient to Mr. Mill, and persisted in: but, {{for my own}} part, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not {{in the habit of}} talking, even so long as I have done in this instance, without making sure that the reader knows <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> about; and it is high time that we should be agreed upon the primary notion of what Fiction is.|$|R

50|$|Dr Deming:They {{realized}} that the gains that you get by statistical methods are gains that you get without new machinery, without new people.

Statistical thinking and statistical methods are to Japanese production workers, foremen, {{and all the way}} through the company, a second language. In statistical control you have a reproducible product hour after hour, day after day. And see how comforting that is to management: they now know what they can produce, they know what their costs are going to be.|$|R
