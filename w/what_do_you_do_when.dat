50|$|In 1970 Arik Einstein, Shalom Hanoch and The Churchills {{created a}} new Israeli sound, {{influenced}} by Anglo-American Rock n' Roll. The album Shablul, in which Hanoch composed all the songs, pioneered this new sound. One of the best-known songs from this album was Ma Ata Ose KsheAta Kam Baboker (<b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> You Wake Up in the Morning). The Churchills, who played {{on most of the}} songs, was a band influenced by the Psychedelic rock of the late 1960s, and this kind of psychedelia appeared in some of their songs. Shablul's lyrics were another expression of musical innovation and changes in Israeli music. The words were written in popular rather than official and formal language, as was used in Israeli songs before. Along with the extraordinary lyrics, one old-style song was in the album - HaBalada Al Yoel Moshe Salomon (The Ballad About Yoel Moshe Salomon).|$|E
