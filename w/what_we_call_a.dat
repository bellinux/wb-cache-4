From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
500|$|Judas Priest's [...] "Dissident Aggressor" [...] is {{the first}} cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman {{described}} the track as [...] "more just {{like one of those}} odd songs {{that a lot of people}} didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one". Meanwhile, [...] "Cleanse the Soul" [...] has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: [...] "That's one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [...] I hate the opening riff. It's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there." [...] The Slayer boxset Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featured, along with four songs of the album, an early version of the title track, recorded at Hanneman's home.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
500|$|RKO {{had scored}} a major {{financial}} success with Cat People (1942). The film, which cost $141,659, brought in almost $4 {{million in its}} first two years and saved the studio from financial disaster. RKO wanted to move quickly on a sequel {{to build on the}} success of Cat People, but producer Val Lewton wished to make the fantasy-comedy story [...] "The Amorous Ghost" [...] instead. As Lewton and studio wrangled, Lewton commenced production on The Seventh Victim, a horror-murder mystery film, and on May 12, 1943, RKO announced it was delaying production on the sequel The Curse of the Cat People due to the unavailability of key performers. RKO production chief Charles Koerner did not want Lewton to be idle once filming on The Seventh Victim ended nor did he favor the idea of Lewton working on comedy, so Koerner suggested that Lewton direct a horror film set at sea, utilizing the studio's existing ship set, built for Pacific Liner (1939). According to Robert Wise, a longtime collaborator with Lewton, it was this set that gave Lewton the idea for the film. [...] "He would find <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 'standing set,' and then tailor his script to the set, whatever it was. That's how he made The Ghost Ship. He walked onto a set and saw a tanker, then cooked up the idea for this ship with a murderous captain." [...] One scholar has suggested that Lewton accepted the assignment in part because, as an amateur sailor himself, the ship captain's behavior mirrored Lewton's own views on how to manage a ship, but also because Lewton saw the plot as a way of criticizing his micro-managing superiors at RKO. The budget, as with all of Lewton's films, was set at $150,000.|$|E

2500|$|Hume divided all {{of human}} {{knowledge}} into two categories: relations {{of ideas and}} matters of fact (see also Kant's analytic-synthetic distinction). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. [...] "that {{the square of the}} hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving [...] some contingent observation of the world (e.g. [...] "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's [...] "ideas", in turn, are derived from their [...] "impressions". For Hume, an [...] "impression" [...] corresponds roughly with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an [...] "idea".

2500|$|But it is {{practically}} unchanged since St. Gregory's time. The Gelasian Sacramentary, which is {{earlier than the}} so-called Gregorian one, is itself later than St. Gregory. It contains the same Canon (except {{that there are a}} few more saints' names in the [...] "Communicantes") and has the continuation [...] "diesque nostros in tuâ pace disponas", etc., joined to the [...] "Hanc igitur", just as in the present Roman Missal. The Stowe Missal, now in Dublin (a sixth- or early 7th-century manuscript), is no longer a sacramentary, but contains already the complete text of a [...] "Missa quotidiana", with collects for three other Masses, thus forming <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> Missal. From this time convenience led more and more to writing out the whole text of the Mass in one book.
