40|$|Patients with {{advanced}} cancers [...] particularly breast and prostate cancers [...] {{are at high}} risk for bone metastasis, leading to accelerated bone resorption and clinically significant skeletal morbidity. Bisphosphonates are effective inhibitors of bone resorption and reduce the risk of skeletal complications in patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases. The <b>standard</b> routes of administration for bisphosphonates used in clinical practice are either oral or i. v. infusion. Oral administration of bisphosphonates is complicated by poor bioavailability (generally < 5 %) and poor gastrointestinal tolerability. First-generation bisphosphonates, such as clodronate (Bonefos; Anthra Pharmaceuticals; Princeton, NJ), must be administered at high oral doses (1, 600 - 3, 200 mg/day) to achieve therapeutic effects, which leads to poor tolerability and compliance with oral dosing regimens. Infusion of bisphosphonates is associated with dose- and infusion-rate-dependent effects on renal function. In particular, high bisphosphonate doses (e. g., 1, 500 mg clodronate) can cause severe renal toxicity unless infused slowly over many hours. In contrast, the newer, more potent bisphosphonates effectively inhibit bone resorption at micromolar concentrations, and the small doses required can be administered via relatively short i. v. infusions without adversely affecting renal function. Zoledronic acid (Zometa; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; East Hanover, NJ) is a new generation bisphosphonate, and the recommended dose of 4 mg can be safely infused over 15 minutes. The 90 -mg dose of pamidronate (Aredia; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.) and the 6 -mg dose of ibandronate (Bondronat; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.; Nutley, NJ) require 1 - to 4 -hour infusions. Intravenous bisphosphonates require less frequent dosing (once a month) and are generally well tolerated with long-term use in patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases. Zoledronic acid has demonstrated the broadest clinical activity in patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastase...|$|R
40|$|Long bones {{often fail}} due to bending loads. Understanding the {{fracture}} process during bending {{is of great}} importance to the prevention and treatment of bone fractures. In this study, we investigated the origin of long bone’s bending strength through {{the study of the}} dynamic previous termstrain redistributionnext term happening during the post-yield stage of deformation and its relation to microdamage at the microstructural level. This was accomplished by comparing the behaviors of human long <b>bones</b> <b>with</b> <b>standard</b> cortical <b>bone</b> specimens in terms of previous termstrain redistribution,next term Poisson’s ratios, microdamage morphologies, and macro-scale fracture patterns. It was found that human tibia failure in bending was very similar to that of <b>standard</b> beam cortical <b>bone</b> specimens <b>with</b> respect to the four previous aspects. Also, the examination of bone’s Poisson’s ratio indicated very different inelastic deformation mechanisms under tension and compression: bone volume expanded in tension but was nearly conserved in compression. Finally, as a result of previous termstrain redistribution,next term bone’s bending strength mainly depended on its compressive strength, which was significantly influenced by the osteonal “porous” microstructure of human bone as compared to its tensile behavior. Thus, we concluded that bone microstructure at the Haversian system level {{plays an important role in}} bone deformation and fracture...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review {{describes}} the recent {{progress in the}} treatment of adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) using autologous gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells, comparing immune reconstitution with respect to allogeneic transplant and discussing differences with gene therapy for SCID-X 1. RECENT FINDINGS: Since 2000, more than 30 ADA-SCID patients have been treated with gene therapy worldwide, with successful outcome in most cases, consisting of progressive immune reconstitution, efficient systemic detoxification, and long-term multilineage engraftment. Gene therapy resulted in restoration of thymic activity and T-cell functions, although the kinetic of reconstitution was slower compared <b>with</b> <b>standard</b> <b>bone</b> marrow transplant. Unlike allogeneic transplant from alternative donors, survival after gene therapy is excellent. In comparison with SCID-X 1, ADA-SCID gene therapy presents a better safety profile and engraftment of multilineage transduced stem/progenitor cells, thanks to the use of nonmyeloablative preconditioning. New approaches using safer integrating vectors are being developed, which may lead to safer and effective gene therapy for ADA-SCID and other genetic disorders. SUMMARY: In the last decade, gene therapy has been developed as a successful and safe alternative strategy for patients affected by ADA-SCID lacking a compatible sibling donor. The application of innovative vector technology might further improve its efficacy and safety profile...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Osteoporosis or {{bone loss}} affects many people, {{particularly}} the aged women, {{and leads to}} disabling bone fractures. An early diagnosis could provide preventive management. However, available bone densitometry equipment are very expensive and not available widely in the Third World. The present work presents the design & development of an innovative low cost bone densitometer based on conventional X-ray equipment available widely. The main innovation is the incorporation of a stack of aluminium with varying thickness placed beside the limb of a patient while taking an X-ray image. Then the optical density of the bone area in the developed film is compared to that from the aluminium stack, which eliminates variations due to all other processing factors, and gives {{a measure of the}} bone density. A low cost device has been developed to measure the optical density of the X-ray film over a circular area of about 1 cm to give an average reading, which is more appropriate than spot metering in this application. Preliminary measurements of a few human subjects using this equipment clearly indicate the differences obtained due to expected osteoporosis. Calibration <b>with</b> <b>standard</b> <b>bone</b> densitometry equipment could provide values in standard units. This low cost innovative method and equipment appears to provide a low cost alternative to the diagnosis of osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Load {{transfer}} mechanisms {{from the}} implant to surrounding bone and failure of osseointegrated implants {{are affected by}} implant geometry and mechanical properties of the site of placement as well as crestal bone resorption. Estimation of such effects allows for a correct design of implant geometry to minimize crestal bone loss and implant failure. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of implant and abutment diameter on stress distribution in the peri-implant area. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional finite element models created to replicate completely osseointegrated endosseous titanium implants and {{were used for the}} purpose of stress analysis. Two study groups that consisting of a regular platform (RP) group and narrow platform (NP) group were used <b>with</b> a <b>standard</b> <b>bone</b> density and loaded using the ANSYS Workbench software to calculate the von Mises and Principal (maximum tensile and minimum compressive) stress. Results: The von Mises, compressive, and tensile stresses in the peri-implant bone were lower in the RP model compared to the NP model. Conclusion: RP model yielded a positive result with regard to lowering of peri-implant bone stress levels, in healthy as well as compromised bone qualities when compared to NP designs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{see whether}} {{parathyroid}} hormone related protein has a humoral role in breast cancer. DESIGN [...] Plasma concentrations and tumour expression of parathyroid hormone related protein were determined (by two site immunoradiometric assay and immunohistochemistry respectively) {{in women with}} breast cancer and related {{to the presence of}} bone metastases and serum calcium concentrations. SUBJECTS [...] Plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone related protein were measured in 57 women with early breast cancer without apparent bone metastases, 28 women <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases, and 13 women <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases and hypercalcaemia. Tissue positivity for parathyroid hormone related protein was determined retrospectively in 106 primary breast tumours from women without apparent bone metastases and 72 tumours from women <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases, 25 of whom subsequently developed hypercalcaemia. RESULTS [...] Plasma parathyroid hormone related protein concentrations were detectable (greater than 0. 23 pmol/l) in 12 (92 %) of the 13 hypercalcaemic patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases compared <b>with</b> 10 (36 %) of the 28 normocalcaemic patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases and five (9 %) of the 57 normocalcaemic patients without bone metastases. Parathyroid hormone related protein concentrations were significantly higher in hypercalcaemic than normocalcaemic patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases. Tumour staining was positive for parathyroid hormone related protein in 22 (88 %) of the 25 primary breast cancers from patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastases.

30|$|Because <b>standard</b> <b>bone</b> scans are not quantitative, when {{examining}} {{for the presence}} of cardiac ATTR images are assessed using relative indices with heart uptake being compared to bone uptake. The most widely used index is Perugini grade which involves a visual assessment of cardiac uptake compared to bone and soft tissue, usually on planar imaging (Perugini et al., 2005). This method accurately identifies ATTR cardiac amyloid (Gillmore et al., 2016; Perugini et al., 2005; Hutt et al., 2017), but has some limitations, for example in known cardiac ATTR the Perugini grade has not proven useful in differentiating subgroups with different prognosis (Hutt et al., 2017). Although this may be a weakness inherent in the bone scan technique, it might also be because of the limitations of subjective assessment using a 4 point discrete variable, or because it conflates myocardial uptake <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> uptake. The non-quantitative nature of <b>standard</b> <b>bone</b> scans also makes them potentially less useful in assessing disease progression or treatment response. Absolute quantitation of myocardial uptake of radiopharmaceutical might help to overcome these shortcomings.|$|R

Of these patients, 131 (including 97 women, 71. 8 %) were diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis and underwent follow-up at the Chang Gung Medical Center. Patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis were categorized into two groups. Group A was comprised of patients who were diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis either before thyroidectomy or within 6 months of the initial thyroidectomy (90 patients, 68. 7 %). Group B was comprised of patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis who received a diagnosis 6 months post-thyroidectomy in the follow-up period (41 patients, 31. 3 %). After a mean follow-up period of 8. 4 ± 7. 0 years, there were 88 deaths (67. 2 %) attributed to thyroid cancer and 13 patients (9. 9 %) achieved disease-free status. A multivariate analysis showed that older age, early diagnosis, and brain metastasis were each associated with a poor prognosis. The difference in disease-specific mortality rates between groups A and B was significant (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: To {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} bone metastasis and skeletal-related events (SREs) on mortality among older patients with lung cancer. Materials and Methods: Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database, we identified patients aged 65 years or older diagnosed with lung cancer between July 1, 1999 and December 31, 2005 and followed them to determine deaths through December 31, 2006. We classified patients as having possible bone metastasis and SREs using discharge diagnoses from inpatient claims and diagnoses paired with procedure codes from outpatient claims. We used Cox regression to estimate mortality hazards ratios (HR) among patients <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis <b>with</b> or without SRE, compared to patients without bone metastasis. Results: Among 126, 123 patients with lung cancer having a median follow-up of 0. 6 years, 24, 820 (19. 8 %) had bone metastasis either at lung cancer diagnosis (9, 523, 7. 6 %) or during follow-up (15, 297, 12. 1 %).
