5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. <b>We</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E
500|$|In post-production, Wan {{found he}} did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was {{basically}} shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. [...] "We did {{a lot of things to}} fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> surveillance cameras, or <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> still photography within the film, which now people say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E
5000|$|Variations on {{the phrase}} {{were used by}} Ken Mehlman, then Chairperson of the United States Republican National Committee, to {{describe}} the Democratic Party's call to withdraw troops from the Iraq War: [...] "Some are saying <b>we</b> need <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> and run, others are saying <b>we</b> need <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> and jog, and still others are saying <b>we</b> need <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> and walk." ...|$|R
50|$|Host {{was set up}} in 1997 to {{work with}} Anita Roddick at The Body Shop International. The {{partnership}} created a global Self-Esteem strategy and creative campaign featuring Ruby, a size 16 doll, who was presented as a role model real women. The campaign aimed to bring attention to the issue of the media waif and skeletal supermodels, associated eating disorders and extreme diets. Roddick argued that fashion stereotypes did nothing for a woman’s self-esteem and, in the long term, are seriously damaging for society. “Once upon a time <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> a suit <b>to</b> fit a body, now <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> bodies <b>to</b> fit suits”. The global Self Esteem strategy was later picked up and utilized by Dove.|$|R

In this order <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> the {{right through the}} forest {{to the foot of}} the hill where precipitous cliffs {{appeared}} to bar our farther progress in this direction. But my escort never paused. Like ants upon a wall, they scaled that seemingly unscalable barrier, clinging, Heaven knows how, to its ragged perpendicular face. During most of the short journey to the summit I must admit that my hair stood on end. Presently, however, we topped the thing and stood upon the level mesa which crowned it.|$|E

50|$|The {{scientists}} examine Ogra, {{and conclude}} {{that he is}} not yet an adult, and that his father must be at least 200 feet tall. On that note of foreboding, <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> Nara Island as Gorgo, the mother of Ogra, attacks. Gorgo trashes the island, sinks a Royal Navy vessel, and resists attack from other warships. Later, Gorgo comes ashore in London, still looking for his son, and goes on a rampage, despite being bombarded by tanks and infantry. Jets attack Ogra, but with no effect. Having demolished much of London, Gorgo rescues Ogra, and both father and son return to the sea.|$|E

Later in the show the conscience arrives and Peter seeks his advice.
