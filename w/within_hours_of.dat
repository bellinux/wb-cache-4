5|$|Cyclone Geralda (also {{known as}} Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda) was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest to hit the country. It originated from an {{area of low pressure}} over the Indian Ocean on January25. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph) on January 31. Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity. <b>Within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened, and by February5, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later.|$|E

50|$|<b>Within</b> 36 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> {{the passage}} of a {{tropical}} cyclone's center, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone's direction. <b>Within</b> 24 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. <b>Within</b> 18 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the center's approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. <b>Within</b> six <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous. <b>Within</b> an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36 hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.|$|R

Realizing that the Mexican army would soon advance towards the Texian settlements, Houston advised all civilians {{in the area to}} evacuate and ordered his new army to retreat.

5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died <b>within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E
5|$|Even faster {{weakening}} ensued through October24 as {{the hurricane}} traversed the Sierra Madre mountains; its eye disappeared from satellite imagery <b>within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> moving ashore. The system weakened below hurricane strength by 03:00UTC {{as it passed}} west of Guadalajara. Patricia accelerated inland between a trough over Northwestern Mexico and the ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. Convection dramatically decreased in organization and the low- and mid- to upper-level circulation centers of the cyclone soon decoupled. The system degraded into a tropical depression by 12:00UTC as little organized convection remained, and the storm dissipated shortly thereafter over central Mexico. Unimpeded by the mountains of Mexico, the mid- to upper-level circulation of Patricia, accompanied by considerable moisture, continued northeast and interacted with a cold front over the western Gulf of Mexico. The new system produced flooding rains across large areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.|$|E
