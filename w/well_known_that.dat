5|$|Washington's haunted {{history is}} so <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{some of its}} haunted {{locations}} were featured in a 2006 documentary, America's Haunted Houses, on the A cable network. Novelist Dan Brown mentioned them prominently in his 2009 novel, The Lost Symbol. Notable purportedly haunted locations include the United States Capitol, Capitol Hill, the White House, Lafayette Square and nearby buildings, Independence Avenue SW, The Octagon House, Chinatown, the National Theatre, Hay–Adams Hotel, Woodrow Wilson House, Omni Shoreham Hotel, and many others.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{micronutrient}} deficiencies {{change the}} development of intelligence. For instance, one study has found that iodine deficiency causes a fall, on average, of 12 IQ points in China.|$|E
60|$|He <b>well</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{those whom}} he incited against Merlin now would, once their blood was up, {{probably}} turn {{against him in}} less than half-an-hour.|$|R

25|$|Some other {{optimization}} {{problems that}} are NP-complete on more general graph families, including graph coloring, are similarly straightforward on split graphs. Finding a Hamiltonian cycle remains NP-complete even for split graphs which are strongly chordal graphs. It is also <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the Minimum Dominating Set problem remains NP-complete for split graphs.|$|E
25|$|After {{he began}} at Fox News, Hume was in discussions about {{starting}} a Washington-based television news {{program for the}} 6p.m. timeslot. The Lewinsky scandal began during January 1998, and Hume's wife told him the story was so <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> he should start the show immediately. Special Report with Brit Hume debuted that evening in that timeslot.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the axiom {{of choice}} is {{equivalent}} to the ability to well-order every set. Being able to well-order the proper class V (as we have done here with L) {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of global choice, which is more powerful than the ordinary {{axiom of choice}} because it also covers proper classes of non-empty sets.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{malnutrition}} is {{a strong}} risk factor for becoming unwell with TB, that TB is itself {{a risk factor for}} malnutrition, and that malnourished patients with TB (BMI less than 18.5) are at an increased risk of death even with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Knowledge about the association between malnutrition and TB is prevalent in some cultures, and may reduce diagnostic delay and improve adherence to treatment.|$|E
25|$|That Arthur {{had gone}} unmentioned in the source closest {{to his own}} time, Gildas, was noticed at least {{as early as the}} 12th century hagiography that claims that Gildas had praised Arthur {{extensively}} but then excised him completely after Arthur killed the saint's brother, Hueil mab Caw. Modern writers have suggested the details of the battle were so <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Gildas could have expected his audience to be familiar with them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{commercial}} HDTV sets started {{to enter a}} larger market, {{but there was no}} inexpensive way to record or play back HD content. JVC's D-VHS and Sony's HDCAM formats could store that amount of data, but were neither popular nor well-known. It was <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> using lasers with shorter wavelengths would yield optical storage with higher density. Shuji Nakamura invented practical blue laser diodes, but a lengthy patent lawsuit delayed commercial introduction.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent report}} on the Sava river in Serbia {{suggests}} {{that many of the}} river silts contain about 100Bqkg1 of natural radioisotopes (226Ra, 232Th, and 238U). According to the United Nations the normal concentration of uranium in soil ranges between 300μgkg1 and 11.7mgkg1. It is <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> some plants, called hyperaccumulators, are able to absorb and concentrate metals within their tissues; iodine was first isolated from seaweed in France, which suggests that seaweed is an iodine hyperaccumulator.|$|E
25|$|It is now <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{persistent}} and chronic gas-related health effects {{are present in}} the Bhopal population. However, the full spectrum of effects is yet to be defined, especially in those exposed as children or in utero, and as manifested in survivor reproductive health. There has been a lack of systematic collection of relevant information in these reproductive effects, and also with respect to cancer development or other chronic illnesses as sequelae of the gas exposure.|$|E
25|$|Unless I am {{convinced}} by {{the testimony of}} the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.|$|E

25|$|We {{recall that}} for a (unital, associative) ring R, we denote by V(R) the (conical, commutative) monoid of {{isomorphism}} classes of finitely generated projective right R-modules, see here for more details. Recall that if R is von Neumann regular, then V(R) is a refinement monoid. Denote by Idc R the (∨,0)-semilattice of finitely generated two-sided ideals of R. We denote by L(R) the lattice of all principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring R. It is <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> L(R) is a complemented modular lattice.|$|E
25|$|With {{the fall}} of Nazi Germany, the White Rose came to {{represent}} opposition to tyranny in the German psyche and was lauded for acting without interest in personal power or self-aggrandizement. Their story became so <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the composer Carl Orff claimed (falsely by some accounts) to his Allied interrogators {{that he was a}} founding member of the White Rose and was released. He was personally acquainted with Huber, but there is no evidence that Orff was ever involved in the movement.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} also other factors that will affect the selectivity. It’s <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{cholesterol}} is normally widely distributed in the mammalian cell membranes as a membrane stabilizing agents but absent in bacterial cell membranes; {{and the presence of}} these cholesterols will also generally reduce the activities of the antimicrobial peptides, due either to stabilization of the lipid bilayer or to interactions between cholesterol and the peptide. So the cholesterol in mammalian cells will protect the cells from attack by the antimicrobial peptides.|$|E
