40|$|International audienceAn {{interesting}} {{alternative to}} reduce phase noise is {{the generation of}} ultre-pure microwave frequencies <b>with</b> <b>opto-electronic</b> oscillators (OEOs). The originality of OEOs is that energy is stored {{in a very long}} delay line instead of a high-finesse resonator. Beyond the scope of continuous-wave radars, OEOs can generate ultra-pure microwaves for many other applications, ranging from satellite telecommunication systems to ultra-low jitter clocks and laser pulses...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{stochastic}} {{dynamics of}} a bistable system {{under the influence}} of time-delayed feedback. Assuming an asymmetric potential, we show the existence of a regime in which the systems dynamic displays excitability by calculating the relevant residence time distributions and correlation times. Experimentally we then observe this behaviour in the polarization dynamics of a vertical cavity surface emitting laser <b>with</b> <b>opto-electronic</b> feedback. Extending these observations to two-dimensional systems with dispersive coupling we finally show numerically that delay induced excitability can lead to the appearance of propagating wave-fronts and spirals.

40|$|This {{contribution}} describes design, {{preparation and}} physico-chemical characterization {{of a new}} photo-stable hybrid antenna based on mesoporous SBA- 15 silica. Concepts of host-guest chemistry are applied {{in such a way}} that one or more photoactive guest molecules are incorporated into the silica channels and on the outer surface, acting as energy harvesting and transferring units. The presented composite system be-haves as efficient Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair and shows high photoluminescence and stability towards photodegradation, representing an important step forward in the search for new efficient materials <b>with</b> <b>opto-electronic</b> applications.

40|$|The {{integration}} of nano structures <b>with</b> <b>opto-electronic</b> devices has many potential applications. It allows the coupling of more light into {{or out of}} the device while decreasing the size of the device itself. Such devices are reported in the VIS and NIR regions. However, making plasmonic structures for the UV region is still a challenge. Here, we report on a UV nano-antenna integrated metal semiconductor metal (MSM) photodetector based on GaN. We designed and fabricated Al grating structures. Well defined plasmonic resonances were measured in the reflectance spectra. Optimized grating structure integrated photodetectors exhibited more than sevenfold photocurrent enhancement. Finite difference time domain simulations revealed that both geometrical and plasmonic effects played role in photocurrent enhancement. © 2012 Optical Society of America...|$|R
