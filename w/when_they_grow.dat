The closest US location from China is Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that allows Chinese visitors without visa restrictions. The island is currently experiencing an upswing in Chinese births. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who often have secondary motives as well, wishing their children {{to be able to}} leave mainland China <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> older or bring their parents to the US. Canada is less achievable as their government denies many visa requests.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes {{were made to the}} first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said [...] "one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode" [...] was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was [...] "a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't something you would immediately think of." [...] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> older and realize that {{they are not going to}} achieve the dreams they once had. [...] " [...] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to worry about that, but that's what we were trying to explore here." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Creation of Patriarchy by Gerda Lerner, {{the author}} states that Aristotle {{believed}} that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle {{believed to be}} perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that [...] "soul contributes the form and model of creation." [...] This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must {{be caused by a}} woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Jim Esch, {{the opener}} [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice" [...] inaugurates and suggests the album's pervasive theme: [...] "fragile lovers buckling {{under the pressure}} of external forces they can't control, self-imposed romantic expectations and personal limitations, while simultaneously trying to maintain faith in one other. It is a theme that keeps reverberating sweetly, and hauntingly, throughout Pet Sounds." [...] Carl said: [...] "The disappointment and the loss of innocence that everyone had to go through <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> up and find everything's not Hollywood are the recurrent themes on that album." [...] Critics Richard Goldstein and Nik Cohn noted incongruity between the album's music and lyrics, where the latter suggested the work to be [...] "sad songs about happiness" [...] while also celebrating loneliness and heartache. In the opinion of Perone, it is the next track, [...] "You Still Believe in Me", which features the first expression of introspective themes that pervade the rest of the album.|$|E
