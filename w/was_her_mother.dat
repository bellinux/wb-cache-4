5|$|The Creator, after {{creating}} Aquaria, {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she would find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E

25|$|The game {{begins as}} four heroes {{are locked in}} battle with a {{powerful}} sorcerer king named Dhaos. Before he can be defeated, Dhaos uses his magic to travel several years into the future, where he is immediately met {{by one of the}} four warriors' descendants and three companions, who seal him away with two magic pendants. Twelve years later, two young men named Cress and Chester return to their village to find it razed to the ground by a dark knight named Mars, whose army kills many of it inhabitants including Cress's parents and Chester's sister. While Chester stays behind to bury them, Cress leaves to meet his uncle Olson for help, who reveals that he is being forced to work for Mars before stealing his father's pendant and locking him in jail.

500|$|Docherty's father {{joined the}} Fife Communist Anarchist Group, {{and was also}} a {{founding}} member of the Communist Party in Britain. Docherty herself joined the Communist Party at the age of 18, the youngest age at which she was able to do so, soon after the 1926 United Kingdom general strike. She initially became a member of the Young Communist League, or YCL. During the strike, she was involved in the [...] "Local Councils of Action", which were inspired by the Russian Soviets, and helped coordinate the strike. The miners' defeat in the strike was very influential upon her. The Communist Party provided her with an adult education, during which she was one of two women among 48 men. The other woman in her class <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> While still a teenager, she became the literature secretary for the Cowdenbeath branch of the party, and was responsible for the production and sale of a number of weekly newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Taking {{work as an}} {{upholsterer}} {{to support}} his family, Cisneros's father began [...] "a compulsive circular migration between Chicago and Mexico City that became the dominating pattern of Cisneros's childhood." [...] Their family was constantly moving between the two countries, which necessitated their finding new places to live as well as schools for the children. Eventually the instability caused Cisneros's six brothers to pair off in twos, leaving her to define herself as the isolated one. Her feelings of exclusion from the family were exacerbated by her father, who referred to his [...] "seis hijos y una hija" [...] ("six sons and one daughter") rather than his [...] "siete hijos" [...] ("seven children"). Ganz notes that Cisneros's childhood loneliness was instrumental in shaping her later passion for writing. Cisneros’s one strong female influence <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Elvira, who was a voracious reader and more enlightened and socially conscious than her father. According to Ganz, although Elvira was too dependent on her husband and too restricted in her opportunities to fulfill her own potential, she ensured her daughter would not suffer from the same disadvantages as she did.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the character's death, Digital Spy's Kris Green praised Crace's acting. He {{compared}} Danielle's {{revelation that}} Ronnie <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> to the EastEnders storyline several years previously, when Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) revealed {{she was actually}} the mother of her supposed sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan). Green opined: [...] "Although it didn't quite capture the magic of [...] it definitely comes an extremely close second." [...] He concluded: [...] "I'd probably {{go as far as}} to say that it's one of the best episodes EastEnders has produced in a long time". The episode was selected as recommended viewing by The Guardian Sarah Dempster. Simon called it [...] "the EastEnders episode of the year", though was again critical of Danielle, writing: [...] "As a nation we've been driven mad by Danielle screwing up her forehead, shrugging her shoulders and walking around like a wide eyed simpleton. She isn't the first person in the world to track down their biological mother and while it's seldom easy, I can't imagine it's ever been quite so hard as Danielle has made it." [...] Writing for The Times, Tim Teeman was critical of the length of time it took for the storyline to conclude, calling it [...] "the most drawn-out 'reveal' in soapland". He deemed Ashdown's scripting of Danielle's exit to be [...] "mad crescendo after mad crescendo", and the storyline as a whole [...] "implausible", concluding that by the time Danielle died in Ronnie's arms: [...] "EastEnders had hit the misery mother lode." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Yorke {{became the}} Executive Producer of EastEnders in 2000. Yorke {{was given the}} task of {{introducing}} the soap's fourth weekly episode. He axed {{the majority of the}} Di Marco family and helped introduce popular characters such as the Slater family. As what Mal Young described as [...] "two of EastEnders most successful years", Yorke was responsible for highly rated storlines such as [...] "Who Shot Phil?", Ethel Skinner's death, Jim Branning and Dot Cotton's marriage, Trevor Morgan's domestic abuse of his wife Little Mo Morgan, and Kat Slater's revelation to her daughter Zoe Slater that she <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Zoe and Kat's storyline was {{nominated}} for 'Best Storyline' at the British Soap Awards, but lost out to the bullying plot in Brookside. The episode where the truth about Kat being Zoe's mother won 'Best Single Episode'. For her portrayal of Zoe, Ryan {{was nominated}} {{in the category of}} [...] "Best Actress" [...] at the 2005 British Soap Awards. For EastEnders 25th anniversary in 2010, Zoe finding out about her mother was voted the greatest EastEnders moment by What's on TV. Also the EastEnders website named the moment where Kat told Zoe that she <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> one of the most 'dramatic endings'.|$|E

2500|$|Extensive {{searches}} {{have been}} conducted to find {{the body of the}} woman reported to the police, but these have been fruitless. Several scenarios have been conceived, some asserting that the woman seen with the baby <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> who had caused the victim's death and subsequently committed suicide. An earlier report, of a woman who told sheriff's deputies that she had [...] "given away" [...] her child to a group of men, was originally connected to the case by the investigating officers; it was later determined that the subject requesting assistance had a male child. Newspapers later published the stories throughout the country and featured pictures of the child, but were unsuccessful with ascertaining her identity through this technique.|$|E
2500|$|Maria Lokhvitskaya {{was born}} on November 19, 1869 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Her father Alexander Vladimirovich Lokhvitsky (1830–1884) was a {{well-known}} lawyer of the time, famous for his public speeches, {{the author of several}} academic works on jurisprudence. The primary source of young Maria's creative aspirations, though, <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> Varvara Alexandrovna ( [...] Hoer), a well-educated [...] Frenchwoman, fond of literature and poetry. Lokhvitskaya's younger sister Nadezhda would later become a well-known humorist writer better known as Teffi, their brother [...] (1868–1933), a Russian White Army general and a one-time associate of Kolchak, fought against the Red Army forces in Siberia. Another sister Yelena Lokhvitskaya (1874–1919) wrote poetry, translated Maupassant (together with Teffi) and was a Drama Society member, but never regarded herself professional. Of Mirra's two other sisters only the names are known: Varvara Alexandrovna (Popova) and Lydia Alexandrovna (Kozhina).|$|E
2500|$|In Bayonetta, {{the witch}} sets {{out for her}} {{hometown}} of Vigrid, where Father Balder is preparing to awaken the creator Jubileus and trigger {{the creation of a}} new world at the cost of the old one. She is followed there by a now grown-up Luka, who himself has become a journalist and has set out to show Bayonetta to the world, as an act of vengeance for her supposed part in his father's death. She also encounters Jeanne, who is under Balder's control, and Cereza, Bayonetta's younger self sent through time by the Lumen Sage. Cereza and Bayonetta become close, with Cereza thinking Bayonetta <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and Bayonetta eventually telling Cereza that she should keep things she treasured close to her heart (referring specifically to a charm Cereza's mother had given her as a birthday present). Eventually, Bayonetta learns the truth of recent events after defeating Balder and sending Cereza back to her own era: the [...] "Left Eye" [...] is actually Bayonetta herself, and regaining her memories allowed her to awaken her latent power. By bringing Cereza into the present, Balder set events into motion that would prevent Bayonetta from forgetting her past when Jeanne sealed her away. Knocked unconscious by the awakening of her power, Bayonetta is sealed within Jubileus by Balder, only to be rescued by Jeanne, newly freed from the Lumen Sage's control. Together, the two destroy Jubileus and save the planet.|$|E

2500|$|On Ashley's {{first day}} of college, {{investigators}} came to her school to question her about her father's death and to inform {{her that he had}} been poisoned instead of having died of a heart attack. An upset Ashley called Castor. Soon after, she says that Castor invited her to come to the family home in Weedsport and drink together. Castor said that they had been through enough emotional stress and needed to relax. Ashley agreed because Castor was not only her mother but her [...] "best friend". The following day, Castor invited Ashley to drink together at home again. She says that her mother offered her a [...] "nasty-tasting" [...] drink that she at first refused but eventually drank because she trusted Castor. Seventeen hours later, Ashley was found comatose on her bed by her younger sister Bree Wallace. Castor made the 911 call. Ashley's sister left her side for a moment and when she returned, she found a suicide note beside Ashley. The note appeared to be Ashley's [...] "murder confession", in which she [...] "admits" [...] to having killed her father and stepfather. Castor quickly took the note from the sister and later gave it to the paramedics. Tests revealed that potentially fatal painkillers had been found in Ashley's system, and that she most likely would have died if brought to the hospital just a few minutes later. When Ashley awakened, with police questioning her about the murders and the suicide note found beside her, she said that the last thing she remembered <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> making her an alcoholic drink, something she had never done before. She told the officers that she did not write the note and was confused about their questions and accusations.|$|E
