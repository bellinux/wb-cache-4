500|$|An {{important}} feature of the Big Bang spacetime {{is the presence of}} particle horizons. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a past horizon on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never [...] "catch up" [...] to very distant objects. This defines a future horizon, which limits the events in the future that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe.|$|E

A participating shop in Istanbul closed following an attack by a gang angered by customers drinking beer and playing music during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fast.

At a meeting in Jaffna in 1975 the TUF's action committee resolved to change the TUF's name to Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). Chelvanayakam, G. G. Ponnambalam and S. Thondaman would be the TULF's co-leaders. The TULF held its first national convention in May 1976 in Vaddukoddai and on 14 May 1976, under Chelvanayakam's chairmanship, passed the Vaddukoddai Resolution calling for the [...] "restoration and reconstitution of the free, sovereign, secular, socialist state of Tamil Eelam". On 19 November 1976, {{in one of his}} last speeches in the NSA, Chelvanayakam acknowledged that his quest to obtain the [...] "lost rights of the Tamil speaking people" [...] through federalism had failed.

500|$|Great Moments in Aviation {{was written}} by Jeanette Winterson, {{directed}} by Beeban Kidron and produced by Phillippa Giles, the same creative team who, in 1990, adapted Winterson's novel Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for television. Giles, for whom Great Moments was her first feature film, believes {{that it was the}} success of Oranges which lead the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to approve the film so easily. The screenplay is inspired by the emigration story of the mother of actress Vicky Licorish, a close friend of Winterson. It is adapted from a short story Winterson wrote entitled [...] "Atlantic Crossing", published in 1999 in her anthology The World and Other Places. The central themes of the story are [...] "race, Hemingway, colonialism, love, lust, the [...] '50s", adapted into the screenplay in a manner Winterson intended to be reminiscent of a fairytale. She ascribes the roles of hero and heroine to Duncan and Gabriel, fairy godmothers to Miss Quim and Dr Bead, and non-archetypal villain to Rex Goodyear. Setting the film on a passenger liner, with brief scenes in Gabriel's native Grenada were intended to contribute towards this fairytale atmosphere, with Winterson explaining that the opening sequence in the Caribbean is [...] "designed to draw the audience out of the world of their own concerns and into a world whose customs are strange. In the new world, objects are unfamiliar and events do not follow the usual rules. The coincidence of colour and language, each more vivid than normal, pull the viewer forward with fairytale immediacy." [...] Of the passenger liner aspect, she explains that it provides the film with: [...] "a sealed and contained world with its own identity and rituals, at once both recognisable and odd. Fairytale never leaves the reader in a familiar spot, we are whisked away to a wood or a lake or a castle or an island, each a law unto itself made all the more uncomfortable because it isn't as weird as, say, planet Mars. We think <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to cope just by using out usual tool kit, how disconcerting it is when we can't." ...|$|E

Instead, Watkins states that this book should be read by those who are worried about the failure of schools in their attempts to [...] "Educate all our citizens into a powerful democratic discourse".
