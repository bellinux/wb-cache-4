A {{large percentage of}} individuals <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> <b>stroke</b> will have limb motor sequelae. Aim To assess the validity and applicability of the results regarding the effectiveness of mirror therapy in patients with stroke and answer the following question: In stroke subjects, can mirror therapy improve motor function? Method We analyzed the article "Mirror therapy for improving motor function after stroke," Cochrane Systematic Review [Thieme 20121].

40|$|Age-related brain {{injuries}} including stroke are a {{leading cause of}} morbidity and mental disability worldwide. Most patients <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> <b>stroke</b> experience some degree of recovery.

30|$|The {{disability}} due to poor {{ability to}} walk in stroke patients is frequently caused by the “foot-drop” symptom that prevents the patient {{from being able to}} raise the foot during the swing phase of walking [8]. The foot slaps down on the ground after heel-strike and the toe drags during the swing phase. In addition to that the patients often lack from push-off power due to weakness in ankle plantarflexors (like, gastrocnemius muscle), which not only reduces walking speed, but also reduce ankle dorsiflexion angles during the early swing phase of gait [9]. Goldberg et al. [10] have shown that the ankle plantarflexors are important for knee flexion velocity during push-off. This leads to insufficient foot clearance that puts the patient at risk for stumbling and falling [9]. Consequently, impairment of walking has been mentioned most frequently (39 – 90 %) as the most important disabling condition in community-dwelling stroke survivors and improving walking ability {{has been found to be}} the best way to reduce dependency [11, 12]. Almost 30 % of patients <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> <b>stroke</b> are affected by foot-drop, where the ankle dorsiflexors (e.g., tibialis anterior muscle) are functionally impaired [8, 9].|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of cardiovascular disorders and stroke in Australian Aboriginal communities {{is more than}} twice as high as non-Indigenous Australians. Approximately 30 % of people <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> <b>stroke</b> are left with some level of aphasia, and yet Indigenous Australians appear to be infrequent users of speech-language pathology services, and there is virtually no research literature about the experiences of aphasia for this group of people. This paper presents the stories of living with aphasia for three Indigenous Australian men living in Perth, Western Australia. Their narratives were collected by an Indigenous researcher through in-depth, supported interviews, and were explored using both within-case and cross-case analyses for common and recurring themes. It is argued that there is value for speech-language pathologists, and other health professionals, {{to be aware of the}} broad experiences of living with aphasia for Indigenous Australians because their stories are rarely heard and because, as with people with aphasia generally, they are at risk of social isolation and tend to lack visibility in the community.

40|$|The {{epidemiology}} {{of stroke}} {{may be changing}} over time {{as a result of}} a number of factors, including an aging population and advances in the prevention and treatment of stroke. Epidemiological indicators and research of stroke have great significance in estimating the impact of this disease on the population. Such research states the distribution of this illness and factors by which it is influenced, follows short-term and long-term consequences, as well as socio-economic burden of stroke for the whole community. Data on stroke prevalence is important for creating the right strategies for health care in a specific area. Stroke-relatedmortality in any population is dependent upon three main factors: the incidence of stroke in the population, quality ofmedical care available, and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and comorbidities that can affect the likelihood of <b>surviving</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>events.</b> The quality of medical care available influences both the number of individuals suffering from stroke and the proportion of case-fatality among them. Epidemiological data shows that stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability in most industrialized populations, and the same is true for Croatia. The existing systemof health care for stroke patients does not meet the needs and is not in accordance with latest trends in developed countries. Hence, there is a need for its reorganization and design of the national project for stroke prevention and treatment similar to those in European countries with favorable epidemiological data...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives. Carers' {{experiences}} {{of caring for}} a stroke survivor were explored, including reactions and changes in their lives. Method.

Semi-structured interviews lasting an average of 43 min were carried out with nine informal carers in their own homes. All were married to someone <b>who</b> had <b>survived</b> a <b>stroke.</b> Results. An overarching theme emerged, entitled: 'lives turned upside-down'. It took time for participants to understand the long-term impacts of stroke. Carers experienced increased caring and domestic workloads alongside reduced participation and altered expectations of life. They found emotional and cognitive changes in their partners particularly distressing, and would have valued more information and help with adjusting to the increased emotional, physical and cognitive workload of caring. Conclusions. It is important to support carers of people <b>who</b> have <b>survived</b> a <b>stroke</b> in adjusting to their changed lifestyles.

40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of {{long-term}} disability among adults in industrialized nations; approximately 80 % of people <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a <b>stroke</b> experience motor disabilities. Recovery requires hundreds of daily repetitions of therapeutic exercises, often without therapist supervision.

This compensation can impede the recovery progress and create new health problems. In this work we contribute (1) a methodology to reliably sense compensatory torso motion in the context of shoulder exercises done by persons with stroke and (2) the design and experimental evaluation of operant-conditioning-based strategies for games that aim to reduce compensatory torso motion.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of a kinesitherapeutic {{methodology}} in a patient <b>who</b> <b>survived</b> an ischemic <b>stroke</b> in the vertebro-basilar system (VBS) during the post-acute stage. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The case studied a 62 years old female patient, <b>who</b> <b>survived</b> an ischemic <b>stroke</b> and pulmonary thromboembolism and was administered to kinesitherapeutic regimen of individual sessions, 3 times weekly for a month. Functional status of the 62 year old patient is weakness and slight latent paresis according the test of Mingazzini-Strumpell {{on the right side of}} the body, mild impairment of balance and equilibrium and dizziness while changing the body position from sitting to standing. The kinesitherapeutic methodology included exercises for the general performance status, exercises for improving the lower limbs strength, exercises for improving the static and dynamic trunk control from different starting positions. The following methods of evaluation of changes have been used for the functional performance status in the patient at baseline and after the kinesitherapeutic sessions: "Berg Balance Scale", "Timed Up & Go", "Five Time Sit-To-Stand" and the test „Sit-to-Stand per 30 sec”. RESULTS: After applied kinesitherepy the static and dynamic balance and the strength of the lower extremities were improved.

Prevalence of AF increases throughout life, affecting less than 1 % of individuals under 60 years, approximately 4 % of individuals over 60 years, and up to 10 % of over those aged 80 years [2, 3]. The estimated diagnosed prevalence of AF in the UK is around 1. 4 % [4, 5], and more than 46, 000 new cases of AF are diagnosed every year [6]. About 15 % of all strokes are caused by AF, and 12, 500 strokes each year in England are thought to be directly attributable to AF [7].

Information on the neurologic out-come of children <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> ischemic <b>stroke</b> is lacking. Children <b>surviving</b> ischemic <b>stroke</b> between January 1, 1995 and July 1, 1999 were prospectively followed. Neurologic deficit severity was based on the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) developed in this study and parental response to two recovery questions. Predictor variables for poor outcome were tested. One-hundred twenty-three children with arterial ischemic stroke and 38 with sinovenous thrombosis were followed for a mean of 2. 1 years (range, 0. 8 to 6. 6 years). The primary outcome based on PSOM assessment was: normal, 37 %; mild deficit, 20 %; moderate deficit, 26 %; and severe deficit, 16 %. The secondary outcome was full recovery in 45 % of patients, based on parental response. The primary and secondary outcome measures were moderately correlated (P <. 001; K = 0. 5). In bivariate analysis, arterial stroke type, male gender, age of at least 28 days, presence of associated neurologic disorders, and need for rehabilitation therapy after stroke were predictors of poor outcome (P <. 05).

40|$|Background: Patients <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a <b>stroke</b> {{usually have}} {{residual}} neurological deficits. Consequently, a rehabilitation program is valuable for improving {{their quality of}} life (QOL). However, age is a known factor that needs qualification vis-à-vis rehabilitation outcomes among Thai patients. Objective: To study the functional and psychological outcomes and the QOL before and after rehabilitation program among three age groups of Thai stroke patients ( 65 years of age). Study design: Prospective, analytical study. Material and Method: Three hundred and twenty seven stroke patients were measured using the Barthel index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and the WHO QOL BREF questionnaire before and after undergoing an in-patient rehabilitation program. Data were collected from nine sites around Thailand. Results: Functional and psychological outcomes and the quality of life score improved after the rehabilitation program. The youngest group of stroke victims showed the greatest improvement in functional outcome and QOL score in both the physical and social domains. No significant difference was found regarding anxiety and depression among the three groups.

40|$|Background. It is {{well known}} that {{socioeconomic}} indicators, such as income and education, predict both stroke incidence and stroke mortality. This means that persons in lower socioeconomic positions are less likely to <b>survive</b> their <b>stroke,</b> {{and there will be a}} selective survival in the group discharged from hospital after their first stroke. Question. Does socioeconomic position continue to predict mortality, stroke specific, or from other causes, among patients <b>surviving</b> their first <b>stroke</b> in spite of this selective survival? Methods. All persons in Sweden aged 40 – 59 years who were discharged after a first hospitalization for stroke in 1996 – 2000 were included (n = 10, 487), then followed up until the end of the fourth calendar year after discharge. Data were analysed with Cox regressions controlling for age, sex, and stroke type. Results. Persons with high socioeconomic position, measured by education and income, have lower mortality than those of low position. Education was not significant when adjusted for income, however.

40|$|Objectives: The {{majority}} of individuals <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a <b>stroke</b> are disabled because of persisting neurological impairments. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous electrical stimulation of the scalp in spontaneous functional recovery of patients with chronic ischemic stroke, by evaluating clinical, neurological, and functional findings. Subjects and methods: Sixty-two (62) subjects who were at least 18 months postdiagnosis of ischemic stroke were randomized to receive 10 sessions of placebo or active low-frequency electrical stimulation (2 / 100 Hz) using subcutaneous acupuncture needles over the scalp. Functional and neurological evaluations were indexed by the Barthel, Rankin, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Results: Results show that there was a significant difference in functional improvement between the sham and active group as indexed by NIHSS scale. The active group had a larger functional improvement after 10 sessions of scalp electrical acupuncture. The other two functional scales (Rankin and Barthel) failed to show significant differences between the two treatment groups.

40|$|Abstract: Stroke {{as defined}} by WHO is {{responsible}} for 5 million deaths and of the other 15 million <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> the <b>stroke,</b> 5 million are disabled by their stroke. In the Indian context in the year 1990, 61900 people died because of stroke and the disability life years lost amounted to 28. 5 million which is nearly 6 times higher than that due to malaria. The prevalence of stroke in the Indian context occurs at a much younger age and therefore {{is a source of}} great socio-economic burden. There has been tremendous progress in the diagnosis of stroke with the advent of newer imaging techniques like CT scan, MRI and Pet scan. Though we can prevent stroke by following certain lifestyle measures but once the stroke occurs, the importance lies in early evaluation and prevention of the development of brain ischemia leading to infarction so that there is no residual or minimal deformity. It is established that the various risk factors like hypertension, diabetes etc. should be effectively controlled as also the lipid management while smoking should be stopped altogether. The point of importance is that we should try and provide treatment to stroke afflicted patients in the first hour that is the golden hour. The use of thrombolytic therapy and various interventional therapies along with anti-platelet agents in appropriate dosages can be very helpful if used judiciously and in effective dosages. The key in the stroke management lies in the prevention and early intervention...|$|R
40|$|Background Postural {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} complications found in people <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a <b>stroke.</b> Parameterizing the Functional Reach Test (FRT) could be useful in clinical practice and basic research, as this test is a clinically accepted tool (for its simplicity, reliability, economy, and portability) to measure the semistatic balance of a subject. Objective The aim of this study is to analyze the reliability in the FRT parameterization using inertial sensor within mobile phones (mobile sensors) for recording kinematic variables in patients who have suffered a stroke. Our hypothesis is that the sensors in mobile phones will be reliable instruments for kinematic study of the FRT. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of 7 subjects over 65 years of age who suffered a stroke. During the execution of FRT, the subjects carried two mobile phones: one placed in the lumbar region and the other one on the trunk. After analyzing the data obtained in the kinematic registration by the mobile sensors, a number of direct and indirect variables were obtained. The variables extracted directly from FRT through the mobile sensors were distance, maximum angular lumbosacral/thoracic displacement, time for maximum angular lumbosacral/thoracic displacement, time of return to the initial position, and total time. Using these data, we calculated speed and acceleration of each. A descriptive analysis of all kinematic outcomes recorded by the two mobile sensors (trunk and lumbar) was developed and the average range achieved in the FRT. Reliability measures were calculated by analyzing the internal consistency of the measures with 95...|$|R
40|$|Caregiving has multidimensional {{effects on}} the lives of spousal {{caregivers}} that in turn have an impact upon the care they provide to the individuals <b>who</b> have <b>survived</b> a <b>stroke.</b> It is important to examine the experiences of spousal caregivers from their perspective. This is a phenomenological study on the experiences of spousal caregivers for survivors of a stroke. Eight spouses (five females, three males) participated in the study. van Manen's (1997) approach was used to examine the spousal caregivers' experiences. Data were collected through audio-taped unstructured interviews. The interviews were transcribed verbatim to form textual descriptions of the caregivers' experience with caregiving. From data analysis six themes were explicated which together form the essence of the experience of the spousal caregivers. These interrelated themes were 1) experiencing a profound sense of loss, 2) adjusting to a new relationship with your spouse, 3) taking on new responsibilities, 4) feeling the demands of caregiving, 5) having to depend on the support of others, and 6) maintaining hope and optimism. This study contributes to health care providers' understanding and knowledge of spousal caregivers for survivors of a stroke and supports the need for continued research in this area...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} aims {{to explore}} the autobiographical genre under the lenses of an emergent interdisciplinary methodology known as ‘complexity theory’ (Waldrop 1992; Jörg 2011; Wells 2013) {{in order to provide}} new insights into non-linear interactions between an autobiographical ‘self’ and its environment. The autobiographical genre gained propulsion during the Enlightenment period as historical men influenced by Newtonian thinking recorded their life reflections and accomplishments (Kadar 1992; Anderson 2011). Since then, autobiographical genre has evolved, becoming more diverse and gendered, including ordinary people’s life stories and voices that are translated and (self) -narrated (Bruner 1987; Smith & Watson 2009). Moreover, the 21 st century autobiographical accounts use a variety of media platforms, producing a ‘networked self’ (Jolly 2012) that designs narratives of performance that reverberates experiential stories, as nodes of relationality and intertextuality emerge organically in the public sphere. Hence, autobiographies become complex, undetermined, non-linear and flexible. In this view, I argue that autobiography shifts from a genre to a self-organization model with its sub-types featuring complexity and hybridity. As consequence, the autobiographical ‘self’ also becomes a complex entity. To illustrate this discussion, this presentation focuses on autobiographies of women with brain disorders, to which I use the term ‘neuro-autobiography’. I examine the case of Jill Bolte Taylor, a neuroscientist <b>who</b> <b>survived</b> a <b>stroke</b> as a young woman. She narrates and performs her story through different media formats such as a published autobiography and a TED Talk video in the internet. I study how the autobiographical self shifts into an agent category that becomes self-organized and interacts with other agents and actants, that is, humans and objects. Furthermore, I discuss interconnectivity and intertextuality as important nodes in a rhetorical ecology that allows the autobiographical agent to engage and act/react from within outward...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of serious and {{long-term}} disabilities in developed countries. Of those <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a <b>stroke,</b> common disabilities are upper and lower extremity motor deficits. Despite intensive training programs, stroke survivors regularly show deterioration of motor function during or after their rehabilitation period. In order to explain any functional progress or decline of motor function, information on body movements performed during daily life is necessary. However, regularly used standardized lab-based systems for the evaluation of body movements are not suitable for measurements of body movements in a daily life setting. Within the international project: ‘INTERACTION’ a wearable sensing system is developed for the ambulatory monitoring and assessment of upper and lower extremity motor performance. The final version of the system consists of multiple sensors integrated in clothing and shoes. Challenging in monitoring body movements in a daily life setting over a longer period of time, is the complexity and the amount of data such a system generates. The main goal of this dissertation therefore was to develop clinically relevant metrics for the ambulatory assessment of stroke survivors' quality of upper and lower extremity motor performance, using wearable sensors. The newly developed data analysis processes enable the assessment of motor performance on a level of body function during functional tasks in a daily life setting. Furthermore, data processing methods are proposed to present all measured data into concise functional reports. The automatically generated reports make it more feasible for the health care professional to evaluate large sets of movement data. In future, these reports may be used to objectively describe any progress or deterioration in motor performance and optimize individual rehabilitation processes. The presented methods are not limited to the evaluation of motor performance in stroke survivors, but could also be used in other clinical cases to objectively evaluate motor performance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In Switzerland {{there is}} a {{shortage}} of population-based information on stroke incidence and case fatalities (CF). The aim of this study was to estimate <b>stroke</b> <b>event</b> rates and both in- and out-of-hospital CF rates. METHODS: Data on stroke diagnoses, coded according to I 60 -I 64 (ICD 10), were taken from the Federal Hospital Discharge Statistics database (HOST) and the Cause of Death database (CoD) for the year 2004. The number of total <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> and of age- and gender-specific and agestandardised event rates were estimated; overall CF, in-hospital and out-of-hospital, were determined. RESULTS: Among the overall number of 13 996 hospital discharges from stroke (HOST) the number was lower in women (n = 6736) than in men (n = 7260). A total of 3568 deaths (2137 women and 1431 men) due to stroke were recorded in the CoD database. The number of estimated <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> was 15 733, and higher in women (n = 7933) than in men (n = 7800). Men presented significantly higher age-specific <b>stroke</b> <b>event</b> rates and a higher age-standardised event rate (178. 7 / 100 000 versus 119. 7 / 100 000). Overall CF rates were significantly higher for women (26. 9 %) than for men (18. 4 %). The same was true of out-of-hospital CF but not of in-hospital CF rates. CONCLUSION: The data on estimated <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> obtained indicate that stroke discharge rate underestimates the <b>stroke</b> <b>event</b> rate. Out-of-hospital deaths from stroke accounted for the largest proportion of total stroke deaths. Sex differences in both number of total <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> and deaths could be explained by the higher proportion of women than men aged 55 + in the Swiss population...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The recent {{appreciation}} that stenting {{has improved}} the short- and long-term outcomes of patients treated with coronary angioplasty {{has made it}} imperative to reconsider the comparison between surgery and percutaneous interventions in patients with multivessel disease. Methods: One thousand two hundred five patients {{were randomly assigned to}} undergo bypass surgery or angioplasty with stent implantation when there was consensus between the cardiac surgeon and interventional cardiologist as to equivalent treatability. The primary clinical end point was freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 1 year. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 2 years constituted a secondary end point. Results: At 2 years, 89. 6 % of the surgical group and 89. 2 % of the stent group were free from death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (log-rank test P =. 65). Among patients <b>who</b> <b>survived</b> without <b>stroke</b> or myocardial infarction, 19. 7 % in the stent group underwent a second revascularization, as compared with 4. 8 % in the surgical group (P <. 001). At 2 years, 84. 8 % of the surgical group and 69. 5 % of the stent group were event-free survivors (log-rank test P <. 001), and 87. 2 % in the surgical cohort and 79. 6 % in the stent group were angina-free survivors (P =. 001). In the diabetes subgroup, 82. 3 % of the surgical group and 56. 3 % of the stent group were free from any events after 2 years (log-rank test P <. 001). Conclusion: The difference in outcome between surgery and stenting observed at 1 year in patients with multivessel disease remained essentially unchanged at 2 years. Stenting was associated with a greater need for repeat revascularization. In view of the relatively greater difference in outcome in patients with diabetes, surgery clearly seems to be the preferable form of treatment for these patients.
