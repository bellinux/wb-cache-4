5|$|Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15. His will swept {{aside the}} Succession to the Crown Act 1543, {{excluded}} both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France. Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by the Privy Council, but her support quickly crumbled, {{and she was}} deposed after nine days.

5|$|King Philip, who {{ascended the}} Spanish throne in 1556, {{acknowledged}} {{the new political}} reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, {{who had grown up}} in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth.</b> This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir. On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the breed in America is {{relatively}} recent. The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> Spalding and other enthusiasts, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created {{by a group of}} breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} were vessels of the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron opposed by vessels of the Confederate Navy's Mosquito Fleet; {{the latter were}} supported by a shore-based battery of four guns at Cobb's Point (now called Cobb Point) near the southeastern border of the town. The battle {{was a part of}} the campaign in North Carolina that was led by Burnside and known as the Burnside Expedition. The result was a Union victory, <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> City and its nearby waters in their possession and the Confederate fleet captured, sunk, or dispersed.|$|E

500|$|A {{multiple}} year odyssey followed, as Agnes and {{her husband}} sought refuge in the northern territories of the Electorate at the castle Arensberg, and later at the city of Delft, with William I of Orange. Living in the Netherlands, they became acquainted <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth's</b> envoy, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and entered into lengthy negotiations <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth's</b> Court to obtain support for Gebhard's cause; these efforts failed to garner assistance for renewing the war either from the English queen {{or in any other}} quarter. [...] In 1585, Agnes reportedly traveled to England in a futile effort to seek assistance from Elizabeth I, but this claim has been refuted by modern scholars.|$|R

5|$|The {{photograph}} {{used for}} {{the cover of the}} album depicts a man rowing a boat made out of strung-together washbasins. The image was captured by Margaret Bourke-White as part of a series taken to document the Ohio River flood of 1937. The cover, which was designed by band member John Flansburgh <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> van Itallie, originally featured only the photo; however, an emblem including the band's name, inked by Flansburgh's former coworker Barbara Lipp, was later added. The emblem resembles the logo of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.|$|E
5|$|Their {{income was}} modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought the {{expectation}} of a small inheritance {{at the time of}} her mother's death to the marriage. They took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> Bennet among a generation of young viewers who had not seen the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion and stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E

5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> II from him.|$|E
5|$|His elder {{daughter}} Elizabeth, {{the heir}} presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, taking {{the place of}} the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found. In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the King's speech from the throne was read for him by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds. His Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.|$|E
5|$|In early 1930 Cochet {{decided to}} rest and only compete in doubles contests. He won at Gallia L.T.C., Carlton L.T.C. (also in mixed doubles <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> Ryan), Biarritz, La Baule mixed doubles with Ryan. His only singles loss came at the Belgian International Championship to Jean Borotra. His most {{successful}} French Championships came in this year when {{he was close to}} winning a triple crown after being victorious in singles over Bill Tilden, in doubles with Jacques Brugnon over Harry Hopman and James Willard and was a finalist in the mixed tournament as well. At the 1930 Wimbledon Championships he was seeded first but made an early exit after his straight-set loss to Wilmer Allison in the quarterfinals. In the doubles Cochet—Brugnon lost in the semifinals as well as in mixed doubles with Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Farnese {{entrusted}} to Count Hannibal d'Altemps {{the capture of}} Weert and continued his advance upon the Dutch Army. D'Altemps encircled Weert with 6,000 men and breached its walls with a two-cannon battery. The defenders of the castle surrendered at discretion but, on Farnese orders, were hanged on the windows, which the Count willingly did because his steward had lost an eye during the siege. Farnese, instead of following the Dutch Army to its quarters, lodged in Turnhout with his troops and his court to forage. Before moving to Antwerp he dealt with John Casimir's German Army. Spanish troops attacked and defeated part of the German reiters near Eindhoven on 10 February. Moreover, while John Casimir himself was in England dealing <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> I, Farnese agreed with his lieutenant, Maurice of Saxe-Lauenburg, {{the withdrawal of the}} Calvinist Army, which the Spaniards allowed to leave the Netherlands freely. Once this matter was finished, Farnese advanced upon Borgerhout.|$|E
5|$|James had a {{controversial}} religious policy; {{his attempt to}} grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received. Mary considered such action illegal, and her chaplain expressed this view {{in a letter to}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, on her behalf. She was further dismayed when James refused to help when the Catholic King of France, Louis XIV, invaded Orange and persecuted Huguenot refugees there. In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter's staff to inform her that William was having an affair <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary waited outside Villiers's room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him. Possibly, Villiers and William were not meeting as lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence. Mary's staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland <b>with</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the notion that it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E
