60|$|The chronicle {{goes on to}} {{tell how}} Leif and his men spent the winter in this place. They {{explored}} the country round their encampment. They found beautiful trees, trees big enough for use in building houses, something vastly important to men from Greenland, where no trees grow. Delighted with this, Leif and his men cut down some trees and loaded their ship with the timber. One day a sailor, whose home {{had been in a}} 'south country,' where he had seen wine made from grapes, and who was nicknamed the 'Turk,' found on the coast vines with grapes, growing wild. He brought his companions to the spot, and they gathered grapes sufficient to fill their ship's boat. It was on this account that Leif called the country 'Vineland.' They found patches of supposed corn which grew wild like the grapes and reseeded itself from year to year. It is striking that the Norse chronicle should name these simple things. Had it been a work of fancy, probably we should have heard, as in the Chinese legends, of strange demons and other amazing creatures. But we hear instead of the beautiful forest extending to the shore, the mountains in the background, the tangled vines, and the bright patches of <b>wild</b> <b>grain</b> of some kind ripening in the open glades-the very things which caught the eye of Cartier when, five centuries later, he first ascended the St Lawrence.|$|E

500|$|Localised {{climate change}} is the favoured {{explanation}} for the origins of agriculture in the Levant.

5000|$|The {{recorded}} history of Pinole, California {{dates back to}} the early 1700s when a Spanish commandant, Don Pedro Fages, led an exploration through the Contra Costa shoreline of California.

[...] According to legend, the soldiers ran out of provisions on their march and found a village of Indians who gave them food. This food consisted of a form of meal, made from acorns, seeds, and <b>wild</b> <b>grain,</b> which they called “pinole” (derived from the Aztec word “pinolli” meaning ground and toasted grain or seeds.)

5000|$|The foods {{incorporated}} in this diet are organic vegetables, fruits and legumes. The diet also encourages {{the removal of}} unclean and unacceptable foods from the individual's diet. This natural, organic approach to eating suggests that one should only eat things created by God {{in the way they}} were intended. That means no processed foods or those produced with contact to hormones, pesticides or fertilizers. Rubin takes two of his main dietary laws from Leviticus. Leviticus (11:9-10) states that one should eat [...] "whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters" [...] but not to eat [...] "all that have not fins and scales in the seas." [...] Rubin says that this means that fish with scales are intended to be eaten, such as salmon and trout, but smooth fish such as catfish and eels should not be eaten. It also means that crustaceans with hard shells such as lobsters, crabs, and clams are not to be eaten. The other main dietary law taken from The Bible is also taken from Leviticus (11:3 and 11:7-8). Here The Bible says that man should eat [...] "whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud". Man should not eat [...] "the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you." [...] This means that the animals that can be eaten would need to have hooves in which each has two parts, cleft down the middle, and which also chew their cud, such as cows, goats, and sheep. The dietary laws that Rubin derives from these passages are generally the same as the Kosher laws followed by Jewish people. In addition to the dietary laws taken directly from The Bible, Rubin believes in eating a variety of whole foods that have not been processed, or that have not been greatly processed. This generally means choosing foods like brown rice, which has not been processed much, over white rice, which is significantly processed. Rubin also believes that organic foods and meat from animals that were raised eating grass instead of <b>wild</b> <b>grain</b> is more in line with the foods man was intended to eat. Snacks are not mandated in this diet, but it is advised to feel free to snack on the foods listed as acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Natufian culture also {{demonstrates}} the earliest domestication of the dog, and {{the assistance of}} this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements {{may have contributed to}} the successful spread of this culture.

Zam Seed, the national seed company funded by the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), has already begun selling seed packets of traditional vegetables. Roots, leaves, tubers and fruits which were discovered, grown and collected largely by women farmers, went out of fashion in Zambia when people left the land to work in the copper mines or towns. According to Dr N. A. Mnzava of Zambia's National Irrigation Research Station (NIRS) Zambians should take a new look at their traditional varieties now that the country's food imports cost US$ 150 million a year. Scientific research into traditional food is yielding good results. The leafy green weed Cleome gynandra (known locally as 'suntha') is more nutritious than the domestic cabbage favoured by most Zambians. Cleome leaves have four times more protein, six times more iron and calcium and 30 times more vitamin A than cabbage. Other traditional crops include cabbage-like leaves of the brassica family, the African eggplant (Solanum macrocarpon) and various species of amaranthus (a <b>wild</b> <b>grain</b> species). Researchers have developed two strains of amaranthus, one bred for its leaf, and the other for the grain, from which biscuits have been made locally on a trial basis. Most of the experimental research on wild vegetables has been carried out at NIRS, located south of Lusaka. Dr Mnzava and his colleagues have found that cleome seeds contain 50 % polyunsaturated mechanically extractable oil, which is edible without refining. More than 300 kilogrammes of seeds can be harvested from one hectare.
