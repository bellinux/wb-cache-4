5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see <b>why</b> <b>we</b> could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|Story editor Irene Diamond {{convinced}} producer Hal B. Wallis {{to purchase}} the film rights to the play in January 1942. Brothers Julius and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on Frank Capra's <b>Why</b> <b>We</b> Fight series early in 1942. Howard E. Koch {{was assigned to the}} screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later. Principal photography began on May 25, 1942, ending on August 3; the film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California {{with the exception of one}} sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.|$|E

60|$|What I am {{arriving}} at is this: When whole races and peoples conspire to propagate gigantic mute {{lies in the}} interest of tyrannies and shams, <b>why</b> should <b>we</b> care anything about the trifling lies told by individuals? <b>Why</b> should <b>we</b> try to make it appear that abstention from lying is a virtue? <b>Why</b> should <b>we</b> want to beguile ourselves in that way? <b>Why</b> should <b>we</b> without shame help the nation lie, and then be ashamed to do a little lying on our own account? <b>Why</b> shouldn't <b>we</b> be honest and honourable, and lie every time we get a chance? That is to say, <b>why</b> shouldn't <b>we</b> be consistent, and either lie all the time or not at all? <b>Why</b> should <b>we</b> help the nation lie the whole day long and then object to telling one little individual private lie in our own interest to go to bed on? Just for the refreshment of it, I mean, and to take the rancid taste out of our mouth.|$|R
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|In America, documentaries were {{produced}} in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the <b>Why</b> <b>We</b> Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro. Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British {{family on the}} home front; Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards {{the end of the}} war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal Diary (film) (1943), Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know <b>why</b> <b>we</b> must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
