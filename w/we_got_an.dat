2500|$|A {{small group}} of IRA members {{and members of the}} Citizens' Defence Committee took up {{positions}} in the church grounds and in adjoining streets. The IRA members were armed with M1 carbines and were led by Billy McKee, commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Also present was Billy Kelly, commander of the Belfast Brigade's 3rd Battalion. The IRA members fired at the loyalists, some of whom were positioned on the roofs opposite. Jim Magee, a local loyalist, said he saw wounded people lying on the road and asked the police (RUC) for help. According to Magee, [...] " [...] said 'if you have anything, get it out and protect your people'. So <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> old rifle and went into Frazer Street and started firing back".|$|E
2500|$|Blink-182 left Interscope Records in October 2012, {{becoming}} an independent act. The band subsequently released Dogs Eating Dogs, an EP, in December 2012. The group planned {{to enter the}} studio to write and record their seventh studio album in January 2015, due for release later that year, but after delays attributed to DeLonge, the band issued a statement announcing his departure. In a press release, Hoppus and Barker said, [...] "We were all set to play this festival and record a new album and Tom kept putting it off without reason. A week before we were scheduled to go in to the studio <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> email from his manager explaining that he didn't {{want to participate in}} any Blink-182 projects indefinitely, but would rather work on his other non-musical endeavors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rockenfield {{wrote the}} music for [...] "In This Light", [...] "A World Without", and [...] "Open Road". After {{finishing}} the framework, consisting of drums and guitars, he sent the demo to La Torre, who would write lyrics and melodies to the song. Rockenfield and La Torre {{turned out to have}} a great songwriting chemistry together, which became evident during their first collaboration on [...] "A World Without". When Rockenfield emailed the band the framework of [...] "A World Without" [...] he had just finished at home, it already had that name as a placeholder song title. La Torre was at his home in Florida and received the song around 2 or 3 a.m. La Torre said: [...] "I played it and started typing as I was feeling the melody", finishing the lyrics and melody to the song in less than an hour. He recorded the vocals, and within two hours sent it back to Rockenfield, telling him: [...] "It is done." [...] They called one another, with La Torre saying in happy tears: [...] "It was the most moving piece of music that brought me to a place, and I'm just so touched by it." [...] Wilton subsequently started writing the guitar solo, and Rockenfield worked on orchestration for the song to be put on top of the heavy guitars, explaining: [...] "I was really in a zone when I wrote it. We wanted to make that as epic as possible. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> orchestra, [...] we brought in Pamela Moore as the guest voice." [...] Wilton said it [...] "is certainly atmospheric and epic, and that Scott Rockenfield is doing all the orchestration and the implementation of the violins and cello certainly add to that." [...] Rockenfield and La Torre wrote [...] "Open Road" [...] a week after [...] "A World Without". According to La Torre, the process was similar: [...] "it just took me into a certain place". The lyrics and melody were finished in a few hours, after which Wilton wrote a solo for it.|$|E

6000|$|So, after all, {{in these}} {{peaceful}} fires {{of the iron}} works, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> idea how the country might have looked in the old picturesque times, when the Highlanders came down and set the Lowlands on fire; such scenes as are commemorated {{in the words of}} Roderick Dhu's song:-- ...|$|E
60|$|This morning <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> early start. We rode {{for hours}} through a {{beautiful}} shady forest, where a fragrant breeze {{in our faces}} made riding pleasant. Large oaks and patches of sumach appeared on the rocky slopes. We descended a good deal in this morning's travel, and the air grew appreciably warmer. The smell of pine was thick and fragrant; the sound of wind was sweet and soughing. Everywhere pine needles dropped, shining in the sunlight like thin slants of rain.|$|E

60|$|At {{the outlet}} of Chamberlain Lake we were {{overtaken}} by another gusty rainstorm, which compelled {{us to take}} shelter, the Indian under his canoe on the bank, and we under {{the edge of the}} dam. However, we were more scared than wet. From my covert I could see the Indian peeping out from beneath his canoe to see what had become of the rain. When we had taken our respective places thus once or twice, the rain not coming down in earnest, we commenced rambling about the neighborhood, for the wind had by this time raised such waves on the lake that we could not stir, and we feared that we should be obliged to camp there. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> early supper on the dam and tried for fish, while waiting for the tumult to subside. The fishes were not only few, but small and worthless.|$|E
60|$|The dawn {{appeared}} at last, after {{two or three}} of the longest hours I remember ever to have passed. Never shall I forget the species of furious eagerness with which we gazed about us. In the first place, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> outline of the adjacent land; then, as light diffused itself more and more into the atmosphere, we caught glimpses of its details. It was soon certain we were within a cable's length of perpendicular cliffs of several hundred feet in height, into whose caverns the sea poured at times, producing those frightful, hollow moanings, that an experienced ear can never mistake. This cliff extended for leagues in both directions, rendering drowning nearly inevitable to the shipwrecked mariner on that inhospitable coast. Ahead, astern, outside of us, and I might almost say all around us, became visible, one after another, detached ledges, breakers and ripples; so many proofs of the manner in which Providence had guided us through the hours of darkness.|$|E

6000|$|How {{by degrees}} this {{slippery}} penitent was induced {{to make other}} confessions; how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> idea of Mrs. Ridley's account from him, of his dealings with Mr. Sherrick, need not be mentioned here. The conclusion to which Colonel Newcome's ambassador came was, that to help such a man would be quite useless; and that the Fleet Prison would be a most wholesome retreat for this most reckless divine. Ere the day was out, Messrs. Waddilove and Tobbins had conferred with their neighbour in St. James's, Mr. Brace; and there came a detainer from that haberdasher for gloves, cravats, and pocket-handkerchiefs, that might have done credit to the most dandified young Guardsman. Mr. Warrington was on Mr. Pendennis's side, and urged that the law should take its course. [...] "Why help a man," [...] said he, [...] "who will not help himself? Let the law sponge out the fellow's debts; set him going again with twenty pounds when he quits the prison, and get him a chaplaincy in the Isle of Man." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife {{without any}} handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, {{and a lot}} of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a {{reticule}} with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other one, though we hunted all around.|$|E
60|$|We voyaged by steamer {{down the}} Lago di Lecco, through wild {{mountain}} scenery, and by hamlets and villas, and disembarked {{at the town}} of Lecco. They said it was two hours, by carriage to the ancient city of Bergamo, {{and that we would}} arrive there in good season for the railway train. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> open barouche and a wild, boisterous driver, and set out. It was delightful. We had a fast team and a perfectly smooth road. There were towering cliffs on our left, and the pretty Lago di Lecco on our right, {{and every now and then}} it rained on us. Just before starting, the driver picked up, in the street, a stump of a cigar an inch long, and put it in his mouth. When he had carried it thus about an hour, I thought it would be only Christian charity to give him a light. I handed him my cigar, which I had just lit, and he put it in his mouth and returned his stump to his pocket! I never saw a more sociable man. At least I never saw a man who was more sociable on a short acquaintance.|$|E

6000|$|But {{that money}} {{was made in the}} Pen I had direct evidence, for I was cell-mate quite a time with the Third Hall-man. He had over sixteen dollars. He used to count his money every night after nine o'clock, when we were locked in. Also, he used to tell me each night what he would do to me if I gave away on him to the other hall-men. You see, he was afraid of being robbed, and danger {{threatened}} him from three different directions. There were the guards. A couple of them might jump upon him, give him a good beating for alleged insubordination, and throw him into the [...] "solitaire" [...] (the dungeon); and in the mix-up that sixteen dollars of his would take wings. Then again, the First Hall-man could have taken it all away from him by threatening to dismiss him and fire him back to hard labor in the prison-yard. And yet again, there were the ten of us who were ordinary hall-men. If <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> inkling of his wealth, there was a large liability, some quiet day, of the whole bunch of us getting him into a corner and dragging him down. Oh, we were wolves, believe me--just like the fellows who do business in Wall Street.|$|E
6000|$|Well, let us {{return to}} our [...] "cutting-in." [...] After the upper-jaw came the lower-jaw and throat, with the tongue. This last was an {{enormous}} mass of fat, about as large as an ox, and it weighed fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds. After this was got in, {{the rest of the}} work was simple. The blubber of the body was peeled off in great strips, beginning at the neck and being cut spirally towards the tail. It was hoisted on board by the blocks, the captain and mates cutting, and the men at the windlass hoisting, and the carcass slowly turning round until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> unbroken piece of blubber, reaching from the water to nearly as high as the mainyard-arm. This mass was nearly a foot thick, and it looked like fat pork. It was cut off close to the deck, and lowered into the blubber-room, where the two men stationed there attacked it with knives, cut it into smaller pieces, and stowed it away. Then another piece was hoisted on board in the same fashion, and so on we went till every bit of blubber was cut off; and I heard the captain remark to the mate when the work was done, that the fish was a good fat one, and he wouldn't wonder if {{it turned out to be}} worth 300 pounds sterling.|$|E
