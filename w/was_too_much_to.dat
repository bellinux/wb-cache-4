5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E
5|$|In Falls the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning. As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a winning}} record, {{injuries}} hobbled {{the team for}} the 2009–2010 season. Reserves Batum and Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Most notably, centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan was likewise not spared, suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice and was in a walking boot. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Although wins did not come as easily as the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and finished 6th in the West. Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee, but returned for Game 4 {{of the first round}} series against the Phoenix Suns. However, the accumulation of injuries <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> bear, and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.|$|E

25|$|Within 17 {{years the}} wall of the {{structure}} began to sag and needed attention. The main issue was the traditional mound the structure was built on, which was designed for a typical Hawaiian hut. The weight of the building <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> <b>To</b> attempt a fix, the entire building was plastered with mortar.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{high-profile}} baby rapes appeared since 2001 (including {{the fact that}} they required extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems). In 2001, a 9-month-old was raped and likely lost consciousness as the pain <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> bear. In February 2002, an 8-month-old infant was reportedly gang raped by four men. One has been charged. The infant has required extensive reconstructive surgery. The 8-month-old infant's injuries were so extensive, increased attention on prosecution has occurred.|$|E
25|$|After being {{defeated}} by a heavy margin of 223 runs and an innings pasting, India {{still had a}} chance of winning the remaining two tests to avoid a series defeat, but that <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> ask against the Invincibles, who were the better team in all respects. This test was the debut test of future Australian great, Neil Harvey.The toss was won by the Australians and on a pitch that was perfectly conductive for batting, Bradman chose to bat first.|$|E

25|$|Ryan Sidebottom and Stuart Broad disciplined bowling yielded four early wickets putting Sri Lanka on 38/4 after 14.1 overs. Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan {{started a}} {{recovery}} but after both their wickets fell within nine deliveries {{of each other}} the game was largely in England’s control. From then on wickets fell at regular intervals and although Dilhara Fernando and Farveez Maharoof added 43 runs for the final wicket it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> ask for the final pair to win the match.|$|E
25|$|During one OOF {{meeting in}} June, a Motion {{was made on}} behalf of Dr. Spong and OrcaLab to use OOF funds to {{contract}} commercial fishermen from the Namgis First Nation of Johnstone Strait, BC, to catch and provide wild salmon for Springer {{while she was in}} her seapen in Dongchong Bay, Hanson Island, the repatriation site and territory of the Namgis. If the money were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an out-of-season fishing permit from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. A member of OOF, together with a representative from NMFS present at the meeting, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations in the region were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters. It was argued that the logistics of feeding Springer wild fish <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> take on for the team, particularly this close to the capture date.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand, {{with only}} four front-line bowlers, {{were able to}} contain England's batsmen but {{struggled}} to dismiss them. Centuries by Len Hutton and Denis Compton ensured a large score, but England made only 307 runs on the first day, Cowie taking five wickets, and Burtt mopped up the tail on the Monday morning to claim five also. Trevor Bailey, in his first Test, troubled the early batsmen with his pace, and the fourth wicket was down at 80. But Donnelly and Smith put on 120 and Smith went on to score 96. A last-wicket partnership between Mooney and Cowie put on 57 {{and went into the}} last morning, but Cowie was injured and could not bowl in England's second innings. Fast scoring by Bill Edrich and George Mann, and less fast by an injured Cyril Washbrook, who scored 103, led to a declaration. But 299 to win in 150 minutes <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> ask and Sutcliffe, Scott and Smith got batting practice as the game petered out.|$|E

500|$|Before the 2000 {{tour with}} Jimmy Page, bassist Sven Pipien {{was fired after}} {{arriving}} late for a performance and missing the return flight. [...] Rich {{said it was not}} enough to warrant termination, but Pipien's defensiveness when confronted about the incident <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> handle. Greg Rzab and Andy Hess were considered as replacements; the band chose Rzab because he had more touring experience than Hess. [...] Rzab, however, departed before the recording of Lions.|$|E
500|$|Accordingly, the {{remaining}} locomotives were nominally {{taken out of}} service on 12 September 1964 apart from No. 46256 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S which hauled a special train on 26 September 1964. By October all were officially withdrawn. Up until March 1964 all the withdrawn Coronation class locomotives were cut up for scrap at Crewe Works, but the simultaneous withdrawal of all nineteen remaining locomotives {{in the autumn of}} 1964 (one of which was preserved) <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> deal with and the work was contracted out to private firms. J. Cashmore at Great Bridge, Staffordshire, accounted for nine of the batch, the West of Scotland Shipbreaking Company at Troon, Ayrshire, dispatched eight and the Central Wagon Company at Wigan, Lancashire, disposed of the one remaining.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, former European Cup winner and Dutch international, Wim Jansen, became head coach. Despite losing his first two games of the season, Jansen quickly turned things round and won the club's first Scottish League Cup in 15 years when they beat Dundee United 3–0 in the final. A tightly fought league {{campaign}} saw Celtic clinch the title {{on the final day}} of the season, stopping Rangers' bid for 10 league titles in a row. [...] However it had by then become known that Jansen was disgruntled with Celtic Managing Director, Jock Brown, and he quit in the immediate aftermath of Celtic's title win. Veteran Slovak coach Jozef Vengloš arrived at Celtic for the following season. A poor start to the season put Vengloš under pressure, but the arrival of new signings and a 5–1 win over Rangers in the league gave rise to optimism. However the league deficit <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> claw back and a Scottish Cup final defeat to Rangers sealed a largely disappointing season. [...] The summer of 1999 saw the arrival of Kenny Dalglish as Director of Football and John Barnes as head coach. A bright start soon faded as Celtic began to drop vital points in the league. A shock Cup defeat at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle saw Barnes sacked and Dalglish taking over as caretaker manager for the rest of the season. Celtic did win the League Cup, but slumped in the league and finished 21 points behind winner's Rangers.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} in Foo Fighters are {{nonsensical}} lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As the frontman, Grohl explained, [...] "I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I look at them and some of them seem to actually have meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of {{the last four or five}} years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as [...] "This Is a Call", defined as [...] "a 'hello' and a 'thank you'" [...] to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl's life; the playful [...] "For All the Cows"; and [...] "Wattershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's [...] "love of hardcore and old school punk rock".|$|E
500|$|The dance {{adaptation}} received mixed reviews. [...] The earliest {{review of}} the London production by The New York Times in November 2005 said that like the film version, [...] "doomed love story remains bittersweet". Matt Wolf of The New York Times panned the original run with statements such as [...] "a potential dance sensation seems peculiarly short on actual dance" [...] and [...] "But a dream ballet {{late in the first}} act and various set pieces later seem, in terms of actual choreography, oddly pro forma for Bourne[...] [...]" [...] He felt that overcoming the obstacle of choreographing dances around a lead with blades for fingers <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> overcome. A fellow critic from The New York Times described it as [...] "visually alluring" [...] two weeks later. [...] On its Christmas2008 return to England, The Times gave the show a positive review: [...] "Matthew Bourne's adaptation of Tim Burton's 1990 film {{is one of the biggest}} and brightest of this season's glut of cultural ornaments. Indeed, so much skill has been lavished on this dance-theatre show for Bourne's company, New Adventures, that it almost feels churlish to withhold my affections." [...] The Independents reviewer was critical, saying [...] "Edward is more kids' cartoon than satire, with two-dimensional characters that stand a hair's breadth from cliché". Another critic from The Independent opened her review as follows: [...] "The best part of Matthew Bourne's Edward Scissorhands is the curtain call." [...] However, contemporaneous reviews by The Guardian were a bit more positive saying that [...] "Bourne is a natural storyteller, who never leaves his audience behind".|$|E
2500|$|The British {{and their}} allies {{suffered}} considerable casualties in the war losing numerous soldiers and high ranking army officers. {{but in the end}} the firepower <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> overcome for the Ashanti.

2500|$|Designer Mark Beierle's {{original}} {{goals were}} an [...] "airplane with {{the feel of}} a hang glider, the agility and visibility of a helicopter, the effortless smooth flight of a sailplane, and the utility and economy of a general aviation aircraft--all in the hopes of getting close to the feel and freedom of a bird."

2500|$|Rana Naved-ul-Hasan's pace bowling <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> handle for the Scottish Saltires, as they whimpered to 132 all out despite Jonathan Beukes making 51. None of {{the other}} batsmen passed 20, as Rana took five for 30 from his nine overs, while James Kirtley bowled tightly to end with a bowling {{analysis}} of 8.5-3-8-2. Sussex Sharks strolled to the target in just over half the allotted time, Matt Prior smashing 13 fours and one six in a fifty-ball 69, while Sean Weeraratna took two for 20 for the Scots.|$|E
