5|$|The {{section of}} the present route between New Castle and Wilmington was {{constructed}} as the New Castle and Wilmington Turnpike, a private turnpike, in 1813. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> become DE 9 originally existed as a county road by 1920.

In addition, the current alignment of DE9 around Taylors Bridge and between Delaware City and Wilmington was paved. In 1931, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become DE9 was upgraded to a state highway between Bay Road and Little Creek and between Port Penn and Delaware City.

5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest seams of silver ore in <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become Nevada, and because their claim was close to the surface, it was easily extracted without initial capital investment.

5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
