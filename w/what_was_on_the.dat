The Revolutionary Committee decided to destroy the cathedral via explosives, and asked a local architect to organise it. He saved the building by pointing out that the vast amount of rubble from the demolished building would so clog the streets it would take years to clear away. However, when metal was needed for the army the brass plaque in the centre of the labyrinth was removed and melted down; our only record of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plaque was Felibien's description.|$|E

Aaron Bay-Schuck, Mars' A representative at the time, found the track's production to be cutting edge, although admitting {{that it was not}} an instant favorite. However, he perceived that [...] "it was something special" [...] but {{had no idea how to}} classify it. Bay-Schuck felt the song needed time to grow as [...] "the more you hear it, the more of an earworm it becomes", leading the promotional department to make sure that program directors weren't afraid of playing a track that [...] "sounded different from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio".|$|E

John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, later recalling, [...] "It {{was a story}} filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney {{for the chance to}} retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a very scary time," [...] recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the series}} uses {{a wide range}} of styles of humor, {{including}} self-deprecation, black comedy, off-color humor, slapstick, and surreal humor, its primary source of comedy is its satirical depiction of everyday life in the future and its parodical comparisons to the present. Groening notes that, from the show's conception, his goal was to make <b>what</b> <b>was,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface, a goofy comedy that would have underlying [...] "legitimate literary science fiction concepts". The series contrasted [...] "low culture" [...] and [...] "high culture" [...] comedy; for example, Bender's catchphrase is the insult [...] "Bite my shiny metal ass" [...] while his most terrifying nightmare is a vision of the number 2, a joke referring to the binary numeral system (Fry assures him, [...] "there's no such thing as two").|$|E
2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{starting}} 5–2, Maryland {{suffered a}} three-game losing streak before their finale at Byrd Stadium. Maryland needed to beat Virginia to {{finish with a}} winning season and likely secure a berth in the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, Virginia led 17–0. Maryland's freshman quarterback Latrez Harrison was pulled and replaced by former safety Randall Jones. Jones along with Heisman prospect running back LaMont Jordan led the Terps to tie it at 17 before halftime. In the third quarter, Jordan ran 90 yards to make it 24–17, but the Cavaliers tied it soon after. With 5:18 left, Terps kicker Brian Kopka made a field goal to make it 30–27. In the next series, Virginia went for it on fourth down but a Dan Ellis pass was incomplete. The Terps took over on downs with 1:40 left. Victory seemed assured, but Maryland failed to convert a first down and the inexperienced Randall Jones ran out of bounds on third down, which stopped the clock when Virginia had no time-outs. The Cavaliers got the ball on their own 24-yard line. In nine plays and just 46 seconds, Dan Ellis led a 76-yard drive that culminated with a touchdown pass to Billy McMullen to win the game with 26 seconds left. The 34–30 loss dashed the Terrapins' hopes for their first bowl game since 1990. After the game, Maryland coach Ron Vanderlinden remarked [...] "Devastating. The worst loss I've ever been associated with because of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sports shoes {{had been}} worn as casual wear before, {{but for the}} first time they became a high-priced fashion item. Converse shoes were popular in the first half of the 1980s. In 1984, Nike {{introduced}} the first ever Air Jordan sneaker, the Air Jordan 1 (named for basketball player Michael Jordan). Although most believe this shoe was banned by the NBA due to the sneaker being too flashy and distracting, others believe it was actually, the predecessor, the Nike Air Ship that was under scrutiny. Nike used this controversy between Air Jordan and the NBA to market the sneaker. The Air Jordan 1 was released in the royal blue color way to the public in 1985 and was an immediate success, still retaining its value in the fashion world today. Soon, other manufacturers introduced premium athletic shoes. Adidas sneakers took the decade by storm, becoming popular among teenage boys and young men. The growth of pop-culture and hip-hop influence allowed Run-D.M.C. to make the Adidas Superstar (commonly known as the shell toe) one of the most sought-after shoes of the 1980s. After their song My Adidas, Adidas reportedly gave them an endorsement deal of $1 million. Nike had a similar share of the market, with the Air Max and similar shoes such as the Air Force One which released in 1982. High-tops, especially of white or black leather, became popular. Reebok released their iconic silhouette The Pump, Converse released the Cons and New Balance had the Worthy 790. The sneaker industry was booming and the hip-hop culture fully embraced it. In the early 1980s, long and white athletic socks, often calf-high or knee-high, were worn with sneakers. As the decade progressed, socks trended shorter, eventually topping out just above the height of the shoe. Run-D.M.C. and other hip-hop groups were also able to influence the apparel industry. Wearing track suits and large chains, they made sportswear companies such as FILA, Puma, Reebok, Nike, Avia and Adidas fashionable. Individuals in the culture also frequently wore bucket hats, oversized jackets and t-shirts, and high contrast colors. Fashion in Hip-Hop was a way to surpass the poverty that surrounded the community. According to Chandler and Chandler-Smith (2008), rap and hip-hop were not one specific style, but rather a mix between high-end luxury fashion and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street. Dapper Dan embodied this concept by redesigning luxury products and making them available to those who wouldn't typically associate themselves with it. Dapper Dan was most famous for cutting up a Louis Vuitton garment and turning it into his signature jacket. He reconstructed garments for many music icons and celebrities in the 1980s before getting shut down by lawyers in the early 1990s. This interest in luxury apparel expanded past Dapper Dan; Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, and Nautica were expanding rapidly and embraced by the hip-hop culture as a sign of status and relief from their financial realities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Several {{companies}} today market {{computer programs}} that allow a blind person {{to use a}} standard computer. These computer programs are called "screen readers". A screen reader is itself a standard Windows computer application, but its job is to run alongside the other programs running on a computer and "tell " <b>the</b> blind person <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen. Because a blind person cannot see <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, a screen reader typically has a built-in speech synthesiser which, although perhaps sounding {{a bit like a}} robot, speaks information to the user through the normal sound speakers of the computer itself. People with some limited sight typically use a different kind of screen reader which magnifies and enhances <b>the</b> image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen {{to make it easier to}} see, and some people use both speech and magnification at the same time. But whether a person uses speech or magnification, typically the screen reader is just a computer application that comes on a CD and easily installs on most computers.
