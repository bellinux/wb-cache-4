When you see {{that this has been}} granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship {{for the sake of the}} peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion.|$|E

Just when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up all hope, then, I suddenly caught sight, {{a little way}} below us, of a strange, weird sort of glimmer flickering among {{the trees on the}} opposite bank. For an instant I thought of ghosts: it was such a shadowy, mysterious light. The next moment it flashed across me that it was our boat, and I sent up such a yell across the water that made the night seem to shake in its bed.|$|R

500|$|At first Matsui {{condemned}} the invasion {{as the work}} of renegade army officers, but he was equally stung by what he believed were unfair denunciations of Japan itself by Chinese delegates to the League of Nations. Matsui suspected that the Western powers and the League of Nations were deliberately attempting to provoke conflict between Japan and China. Matsui believed that the 30 million Manchurians had been relieved by the Japanese invasion and conquest, which he called 'the Empire's sympathy and good faith' and [...] that the solution to the larger regional problem was for the nations of Asia to create their own [...] "Asian League", which would [...] "extend to the 400 million people of China the same help and deep sympathy that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Manchuria".|$|E
500|$|By his marriage, William's father John Yeats was {{studying}} law but abandoned his studies to study art at Heatherley's Art School in London. His mother, Susan Mary Pollexfen, {{came from a}} wealthy merchant family in Sligo, who owned a milling and shipping business. Soon after William's birth the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo {{to stay with her}} extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his [...] "country of the heart" [...] So also did its location on the sea; John Yeats stated that [...] "by marriage with a Pollexfen, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a tongue to the sea cliffs". The Butler Yeats family were highly artistic; his brother Jack became an esteemed painter, while his sisters Elizabeth and Susan Mary—known to family and friends as Lollie and Lily—became involved in the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E

500|$|With no one {{to replace}} Bradley, {{lawlessness}} continued in the Everglades and rookeries were devastated for several more years. Frank Chapman remarked that [...] "There is no community sufficiently law-abiding to leave a bank vault unmolested if it were left unprotected. [...] <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up. [...] We can't protect it, and the rookery will have to go." [...] In November 1908, game warden and deputy sheriff of DeSoto County, Columbus G. McLeod, went missing near Charlotte Harbor. [...] A month later, his boat was found weighted down and sunk; inside, police found the warden's bloodstained hat, long gashes cut into the crown with {{what appeared to be}} an axe. [...] It was suspected that he was killed by poachers. [...] His body was never found and the perpetrators were not caught.-despite the offer of a $100.00 reward by Florida's Governor Albert W. Gilchrist [...] Later that year, an employee of the South Carolina Audubon Society, Pressly Reeves, was shot and killed during an ambush by unknown assailants.|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 6, and Obama was projected the winner at about 11:14 pm Eastern Standard Time. [...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine battleground states, and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had {{thought they were going to}} win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> our all to this campaign. I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E
500|$|While the {{upheaval}} continued at Spithead, Duncan had retained {{order in the}} North Sea Fleet at Yarmouth by the sheer force of his personality. When men from his flagship, , clambered up into the rigging and roared three cheers in a prearranged signal for the revolt to begin on 1 May, Duncan initially threatened to run the ringleader through with his sword. Calmed by his subordinates, he instead assembled his officers and the Royal Marines aboard his ship and advanced on {{the men in the}} rigging, demanding to know what they were doing. So fierce was his tone that the men fell silent and hesitantly returned to their quarters except for five ringleaders, whom he admonished personally on his quarterdeck before issuing a general pardon and dismissing them to their duty. The following week, he assembled all of the men and demanded to know whether they would follow his orders: in response, the crew nominated a spokesman, who apologised for their actions, saying, [...] "we humbly implore your honour's pardon with hearts full of gratitude and tears in our eyes for the offense <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> to the worthiest of commanders who has proved a father to us". A week later, when a similar outbreak of mutiny affected the fourth rate ship, , under Captain William Hotham, Duncan again acted decisively, coming aboard Adamant as the crew rebelled and demanding to know if there was any man who disputed his authority. When a sailor stepped forward, Duncan seized him by his shirt and dangled him {{over the side of the}} ship with one arm crying, [...] "My lads – look at this fellow – he who dares to deprive me of command of the fleet". The mutiny evaporated almost instantly.|$|E

2500|$|Urban {{wrote that}} Gordon's [...] "most stupid mistake" [...] {{occurred}} when he revealed his secret orders {{at a meeting}} of tribal leaders on 12 February at Berber, explaining that the Egyptians were pulling out, leading to almost all of the Arab tribes of northern Sudan declaring their loyalty to the Mahdi. Given that Gordon himself in his interview with Stead had stated: [...] "The moment it is known that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up the game, every man will go over to the Mahdi", his decision to reveal that the Egyptians were pulling out remains inexplicable. Shortly afterwards, Gordon wrote what Urban called a [...] "bizarre" [...] letter to the Mahdi telling him to accept the authority of the Khedive of Egypt and offering him the chance to work as one of Gordon's provincial governors. The Mahdi contemptuously rejected Gordon's offer and sent back a letter demanding Gordon convert to Islam.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia concurred in {{the opinion}} of the Court, except for its {{discussion}} of the legislative history [...] the form the law took when it was a bill pending before Congress, and the statements various members of Congress made while it was pending. Justice Scalia believed that the text of the statute passed by Congress {{was the only thing that}} was important. [...] "The examination [...] does not uncover anything useful (i.e., anything that tempts us to alter the meaning we deduce from the text anyway), but that is the usual consequence of these inquiries (and a good thing, too)." [...] Ultimately, though, Justice Scalia found the effort futile. [...] "I can discern no reason for devoting 10 pages of today's opinion to legislative history, except to show that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> this case close and careful consideration. We must find some better way of demonstrating our conscientiousness." ...|$|E
