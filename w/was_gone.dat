5|$|According to an unquoted {{source in}} The Outlaw Bible of American Literature, on June 3, 1968, at 9:00am, Solanas {{arrived at the}} Chelsea Hotel, where Girodias lived.

She {{remained}} for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available.|$|E
5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> {{and he seemed to}} be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E

5|$|In November 1995, Trautmann {{returned}} to Maine Road {{to open the}} rebuilt Kippax Stand. However, the stand <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> within a decade: in May 2003 the club moved to the City of Manchester Stadium, Maine Road was closed and its stadium demolished the following year.|$|E

Kenema was thrown into a state of shock and mourning.|$|E

We went out to the pool, and I was bragging about getting new cars the next day."We had an 11 o'clock appointment to pick up the cars the next day.

It also soon disappeared from the top 100, and <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by late February.|$|E
5|$|Though Stanley and Black won the election, {{they never}} became {{political}} allies. At {{the time of}} their election and service, the Kentucky Constitution prescribed that the lieutenant governor would act as governor any time the governor left the state. Consequently, Stanley refused to travel out of state on vacation because he feared he would not approve of anyone Black would appoint to any unfilled governmental offices while he <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|Advancing up {{the ridge}} {{they had just}} abandoned, Browne's {{battalion}} came under intense fire from Ruffin's emplaced infantry and artillery. Within a few salvoes, half the battalion <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> and, unable to continue, Browne's men scattered amongst the cover provided by the slope and returned fire. Despite his success, Ruffin could not descend the hill to brush away the remnants of Browne's battalion, as Dilkes's brigade had by now emerged from the wood and was forming up {{at the base of}} the slope.|$|E
5|$|Against {{the advice}} of Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} to advance the regiment. The element of surprise <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> and it was dark. Dove knew the probability of being attacked was high, and he took steps to minimize the danger to the main column. The advance guard was ambushed around 1:00 am on May 2. Dove received a severe wound on his foot, {{and two of his}} men were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed. Paxton, who was popular with the regiment, was dismissed by General Eliakim P. Scammon after the regiment returned to camp.|$|E
5|$|As {{the college}} {{prepared}} for independence in 1953, Madgwick {{and his staff}} discussed establishing a farm-related degree program distinctive from the veterinary science degree offered at the University of Sydney. Madgwick journeyed to England and the United States to consult with agriculturalists, veterinarians, and specialists in animal husbandry. While Madgwick <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> his deputy warden, James Belshaw, read a letter in the Australian Veterinary Journal from Gordon McClymont, a researcher in animal nutrition for the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which advocated {{the establishment of a}} multi-disciplinary approach to farm science combining animal husbandry and agronomy.|$|E

5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the excitement that surrounded the Giants the previous year <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:13pm, the aircraft's {{tail section}} sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming {{to bring the}} plane back to level flight. At approximately 10:15pm, Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it {{had not yet been}} determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard; but an armed search quickly confirmed that he <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Author Timothy White {{has called}} Paramount's efforts to launch its own {{television}} service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – Paramount in effect was competing with itself. The resulting ill feelings between Paramount's and DuMont's executives continued to escalate throughout the early 1950s, {{and the lack}} of cooperation hindered both entities' network plans. According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense of cooperation between Paramount and DuMont <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for those still down there.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav {{fell ill}} in early 1660 and died on 23 February of that year. With his death, {{one of the}} major {{obstacles}} to peace <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> and the Treaty of Oliwa was signed on 23 April. Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia, and John II Casimir withdrew his claims to the Swedish throne, though he was to retain the title for life. All occupied territories were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the steep}} decline in routes, {{the company was}} reorganized into a virtual airline in 1999. All {{operations}} were {{taken over by the}} Swedish airline Golden Air, who would operate the Saab 340 aircraft. At the same time, Golden Air bought half of Teddy Air. In October, Coast Air announced that they had too few aircraft to continue flying from Stord, and would terminate operations. Teddy Air became the only airline to serve Stord. 1999 returned a loss of NOK6.9 million. In 2004, Teddy Air terminated all services. The contract with Golden Air was discontinued, and the hangar at Geiteryggen was sold. The company remained on paper until 2005, when the equity <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> and the entity was dissolved.|$|E
