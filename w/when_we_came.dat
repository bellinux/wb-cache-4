Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind me when we played L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".|$|E

Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw the lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; and then we heard the thunder, and that was the big guns; and then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped." ...|$|E

500|$|The Cure {{are often}} {{identified}} with the gothic rock genre, and are viewed {{as one of the}} form's definitive bands. Selecting the Best for One Side of a C90 |last=Doran |first=John |date=27 October 2008 |website=The Quietus}} However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band. Robert Smith said in 2006, [...] "It's so pitiful when 'goth' is still tagged onto the name the Cure", and added, [...] "We're not categorisable. I suppose we were post-punk <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out, but in total it's impossible [...] I just play Cure music, whatever that is." [...] Smith has also expressed his distaste for gothic rock, describing it as [...] "incredibly dull and monotonous. A dirge, really." [...] While typically viewed as producers of dark and gloomy music, the Cure have also yielded a number of upbeat songs and been part of the new wave movement. Spin has said [...] "the Cure have always been an either/or sort of band: either [...] Robert Smith is wallowing in gothic sadness or he's licking sticky-sweet cotton-candy pop off his lipstick-stained fingers." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2nd Raiders {{suffered}} 16killed and 17wounded (plus 2wounded native guides). Non-battle casualties totaled 225, {{of which}} 125suffered from malaria, 29 from dysentery, and 71 from ringworm or jungle rot. Most {{of the remaining}} raiders were also suffering some type of physical ailment. On 17 December, the raiders departed Guadalcanal by ship and arrived back at their home camp on Espiritu Santo on 20 December. At Espiritu Santo, the unit continued {{to be affected by}} the lingering tropical diseases many had contracted during the Guadalcanal patrol. In the second week of March 1943, the 2ndRaiders were declared unfit for combat duty, although this finding was never announced in an official document. The 2nd Marine Raiders did not participate as a unit in a combat operation until the Bougainville campaign beginning on 1 November 1943. In spite of the high fallout from disease, Carlson's troops generally felt that they had performed well as a unit during the patrol and had accomplished their mission. Cleland E. Early—a lieutenant in Carlson's Company E—described the long Guadalcanal patrol and the effect on his unit: [...] "Enduring the living conditions was worse than the combat. My platoon went in with 30men, one corpsman and one officer. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out we had one officer, one corpsman, and 18enlisted, all of whom had malaria, worms, diarrhea, jungle rot and high morale.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E
