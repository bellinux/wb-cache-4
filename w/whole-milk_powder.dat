50|$|Klim was {{developed}} as a dehydrated <b>whole-milk</b> <b>powder</b> {{for use in the}} tropics, where ordinary milk tended to spoil quickly. It soon became a staple of scientific explorers, geologists, soldiers, and other jungle travelers who needed a lightweight dry ration that would keep for several days in high heat and humidity, even when decanted from its container.|$|E
50|$|In {{their study}} of proteins, Osborne and Mendel also aided in the {{discovery}} of vitamins. During their feeding trials, they noticed that young rats fed diets with sufficient carbohydrate (in the form of wheat flour) and purified protein, but with vegetable fats or lard instead of butter grew and developed normally for around eighty days, then suddenly began to decline in health and weight then soon died. Many of the animals also developed sore eyes or even ulcers on their eyeballs. Something other than carbohydrates, fats and complete proteins was missing from this artificial diet. When {{a small amount of}} butter was added to the feed mixture, the afflicted rats soon recovered completely and continued growing. <b>Whole-milk</b> <b>powder</b> also had the same effect on rat growth. In 1913, the Station’s Annual Report stated that “experiments have shown that some still unknown substance is essential to growth and that this unknown substance is present in milk. Much work is being done in an effort to discover an isolate this substance.” As it turns out, this substance was Vitamin A. Concurrently with Osborne and Mendel, Elmer V. McCollum (a former student of Osborne) and Marguerite Davis at the University of Wisconsin were obtaining similar results, and although the scientists submitted their report for publication several weeks prior to the Station scientists, it is clear that both parties discovered vitamins independently.|$|E
40|$|Retentates {{containing}} 20, 27, and 34 % total solids, {{obtained on}} commercial scale by the ultrafiltration of milk were spray-dried on laboratory scale using centrifugal atomization and single stage drying with the {{inlet air temperature}} of 220 C and the outlet air temperature of 90 C. The protein content in the powders was 31 % to 35 % compared to 24. 8 % protein in the control <b>whole-milk</b> <b>powder.</b> Lactose contents were markedly lower in the retentate powders (- 10. 6 %) than in the milk powder (40. 4 %). Storage of the powders at 37 C resulted in a marked increase in the 5 -hydroxmethylfural contents with doubling of this content in the retentate powders and tripling in the milk powder. When viewed by scanning electron microscopy, the spray-dried retentate powder particles had smooth surfaces free from wrinkles usually seen in spray-dried milk powders. When the same products were exposed to atmospheres having 75 %, 85 %, or 100 % relative humidity, the retentate powders exhibited less lactose recrystallization than the milk powder. The melting temperature (Tm) (as determined by differential scanning calorimetry) of lactose present in the retentate powders was not affected by the reduced lactose content in the powders but the fusion enthalpy of lactose was reduced in the retentate powders compared to the control milk powder...|$|E
