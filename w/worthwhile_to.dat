5|$|Incomes vary by county. The median {{family income}} in Cuyahoga County is $54,506, where the Cleveland Clinic {{is the single}} largest employer. Cleveland also has {{emerging}} biotechnology and financial concentrations. It is also <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> note that while some cities in Ohio have declining populations, the overall growth in per capita income in Ohio increased by 4.6% from 2005 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{significant}} increases detected, it is <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> {{consider that the}} number of pharmaceuticals dispensed for legitimate therapeutic uses may be increasing over time, and DAWN estimates are not adjusted to take such increases into account. Nor do DAWN estimates take into account the increases in the population or in ED use between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|In May 1932, Kalep {{traveled}} from France to New York on the steamship SS Paris {{with the intention}} of flying back to Europe across the Atlantic Ocean; at the time, no woman had made a solo transatlantic flight. She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight from Canada to Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided {{that it would not be}} <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> make her own attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 other female aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams from Los Angeles to Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E

5|$|King won the Child's Bowling Cup, {{the premier}} award for bowling in American cricket, {{for the first}} time in 1896, and joined the Philadelphian cricket team's tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was {{arranged}} mainly for educational purposes: few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897, the tour started on June 7 at Oxford, ending in late July at The Oval almost 2 months later. The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> put their best elevens onto the field.|$|E
5|$|In April 1995, the State Duma {{considered}} {{the first draft}} of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> substitute experts' medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book Punitive Medicine, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior. Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity. A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.|$|E

25|$|Piping is {{most common}} {{when there is}} more than one queen in a hive.

25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or rail {{switches}} (US) are power-operated, {{it can be}} <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> signal each line in both directions, so that the double line becomes a pair of single lines.

25|$|Lancashire awarded him {{a benefit}} in 1923, but {{although}} {{he was still a}} most effective stock bowler Cook that season appeared to have lost much of his spin and was dropped for a number of matches late in the season.

His structuralist paradigm, when accepted in its original form, turns scholarly attention to a wider problem: how our species acquired the capacity to establish social institutions in general.|$|E

25|$|It was unusual, but not unprecedented, for GWR to use outside {{contractors}} to build locomotives (50 of the 200 strong 5600 class {{had been built}} by Armstrong Whitworth). The building programme was partly funded by interest-free Government loans intended to relieve unemployment during the Great Depression. Also, stricter accountancy rules that distinguished between maintenance and building costs meant that it was often economically <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> build new locomotives rather than repair older locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Before {{investing}} Badajoz, Beresford {{thought it}} <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> drive Latour-Maubourg's force out of Extremadura.

Abandoning Llerena on the 19th, Latour-Maubourg withdrew to Guadalcanal in Andalusia. Before starting {{the siege of}} Badajoz, Beresford posted Spanish cavalry at Llerena and British cavalry at Zafra. They were supported by a brigade of British infantry under Lieutenant Colonel John Colborne.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{photoelectric}} effect {{is associated with}} Albert Einstein, who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905, an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize. It is <b>worthwhile</b> <b>to</b> note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons {{is proportional to the}} frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of quanta, for the first time.|$|E
