Essex was heavily reinforced and drew his army together for action in the last days of August. Press-ganging had to be resorted to in order to fill the ranks, and recruiting for Waller's new army was stopped. London sent six regiments of trained bands to the front, closing the shops so that every man should be free to take his part in what was thought to be the supreme trial of strength.|$|E

The Lords still favoured a compromise, and suggested {{the addition of a}} paragraph to the petition reading [...] "We humbly present this petition to your majesty, not only with a care of preserving our own liberties, but with due regard to leave entire that sovereign power, <b>wherewith</b> your majesty is trusted, for the protection, safety, and happiness of your people". By 20 May the Commons had agreed to one more minor alteration, but had not decided whether to accept the new paragraph. Coke made a speech urging them to reject all of it, saying that to use the phrase [...] "sovereign power" [...] would mean admitting that the King had the power to destroy any limitations the Petition might place on his power".|$|E

However, {{he did not have the}} propensity to sin. Christ could be tested by temptation, but like Adam before the fall, did not have the ungodly desires or sinful inclinations of humanity. Ellen White states [...] "The Lord Jesus came to our world, not to reveal what a God could do, but what a man could do, through faith in God’s power to help in every emergency.

[...] This volume centers on Matthew 23, in which the scribes and Pharisees are condemned for degrading God's will and word.

2500|$|According to the American Psychiatric Association, a Western medical {{condition}} similar in many aspects to culturally bound syndromes, particularly the [...] "running" [...] syndromes, of which grisi siknis is part, is dissociative (or psychogenic) fugue. In any fugal state, a person appears normal, but has amnesia or identity forgetfulness. Dissociative fugue is distinguished by impulsive travel and amnesia, identity uncertainty, stress, and impediment to normal social function, {{all of which}} must not be influenced by substance intake. It is most often related to intense emotional stress and occurs randomly. However, some argue that [...] "running" [...] syndromes are really not dissociative fugue, and have no proper Western medical classification. Others contend that associating culturally bound symptoms with known ailments severely limits the discovery of new psychiatric disorders in folk culture. Edgardo Ruiz, PhD at the University of Pittsburgh argues that grisi siknis does not correlate with Western scientific cultural perspectives, and the cross-cultural translation of symptoms is an inaccurate device <b>wherewith</b> to understand the disease.|$|E

[...] The sentencing took place in November 1643, but Gorton and the others were released from prison in March 1644, being banished from both Massachusetts and from Shawomet (which was now claimed by Massachusetts). [...] Gorton and his associates were restricted from their own lands, so they went instead to Aquidneck Island and were warmly greeted by a faction of residents who were opposed to Governor Coddington.|$|E

2500|$|The Bible {{does not}} command wearing {{of a unique}} prayer shawl or tallit.

These passages do not specify tying particular types or numbers of knots in the fringes. The exact customs regarding the tying of the tzitzit and the format of the tallit are of post-biblical, rabbinic origin and, though the Talmud discusses these matters, slightly different traditions have developed in different communities.

2500|$|In {{a period}} of rapid {{linguistic}} change the translators avoided contemporary idioms, tending instead towards forms that were already slightly archaic, like verily and it came to pass. The pronouns thou/thee and ye/you are consistently used as singular and plural respectively, even though by this time you was often found as the singular in general English usage, especially when addressing a social superior (as is evidenced, for example, in Shakespeare). [...] For the possessive of the third person pronoun, the word its, first recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1598, is avoided. The older his is usually employed, as for example at : [...] "if the salt have lost his savour, <b>wherewith</b> shall it be salted?"; in other places of it, thereof or bare it are found. Another sign of linguistic conservativism is the invariable use of -eth for the third person singular present form of the verb, as at Matthew 2:13: [...] "the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dreame". The rival ending -(e)s, as found in present-day English, was already widely used by this time (for example, it predominates over -eth in the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe). Furthermore, the translators preferred which to who or whom as the relative pronoun for persons, as in : [...] "And Lot also which went with Abram, had flocks and heards, & tents" [...] although who(m) is also found.|$|E

[...] She wrote later: [...] "I met many saintly priests that month, but I also found that in spite of being above angels by their supreme dignity, they were none the less men and still subject to human weakness. If the holy priests, 'the salt of the earth', as Jesus calls them in the Gospel, have to be prayed for, what about the lukewarm? Again, as Jesus says, 'If the salt shall lose its savour, <b>wherewith</b> shall it be salted?' I understood my vocation in Italy." [...] For the first time too she had associated with young men. [...] "In her brotherless existence, masculinity had been represented only by her father, her Uncle Guérin and various priests. Now she had her first and only experiences. Céline declared at the beatification proceedings that one of the young men in the pilgrimage group [...] "developed a tender affection for her". Thérèse confessed to her sister, [...] "It is high time for Jesus to remove me from the poisonous breath of the world...I feel that my heart is easily caught by tenderness, and where others fall, I would fall too. We are no stronger than the others." [...] Soon after that, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse. On 9 April 1888 she became a Carmelite postulant.|$|E
