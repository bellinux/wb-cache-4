30|$|Yasargil {{aneurysm}} clips {{were introduced}} into neurosurgical practice more than 25  years ago. The clip {{is named after}} Michael G. Yasargil, Professor in Neurosurgery. The clips were designed to close blood vessels in difficult-to-reach intracranial locations. Made of titanium due to its better <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratio</b> than its cobalt-chromium competitors, they may stay in situ without losing strength, do not corrode and show no artefacts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans [12].|$|E

Substituting high strength steel (HSS) for conventional mild steel to reduce the <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratio</b> is recognized as an effec-tive way {{to achieve this goal}} and is increasingly be-ing used.

50|$|Until the 1950s, {{almost all}} yachts {{were made of}} wood or steel, but a much wider range of {{materials}} is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is fibreglass, followed by aluminium, steel, carbon fibre, and ferrocement (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed {{and is no longer}} limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as plywood, veneers, skinned balsa and epoxy resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratios</b> of all boatbuilding materials.|$|R
40|$|Multidirectional {{composite}} laminates {{have been}} increasingly used as primary load-bearing structures in many -applications such as aircraft frames, wings, and turbine or wind-mill blades, owing to their excellent <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratios,</b> better environmental resistance, and much improved long-term durability. Such high [...] performance polymer matrix composites typically consist {{of dozens of}} unidirectional plies of ~ 0. 1 mm thick and aligned in different directions. However, because of the highly heterogeneous nature of such materials, they exhibit very complex progressive damage processes which are dominated by the nucleation, propagation, merging, bifurcation of many different systems of small cracks (intraply cracks, delaminations, microbuckle induced kinking, etc) before they eventually grow to a sufficiently large damage zone of structural criticality. In the past, this complex problem has been addressed by various continuum damage mechanics models, which are of phenomenological nature and merely consider the load-bearing loss of the damaged materials, but with no explicit representation of these crack systems. More recently, the need to address such subcritical cracks has been increasingly appreciated because their evolution represents {{a significant portion of}} the structural life and they can facilitate many unexpected early structure failure upon changing of loading or environmental conditions. However, up to date there still lack effective analytical or numerical methods that can faithful predict the evolution of such cracking systems, let along to quantify their effects on structural criticality. The difficulties arise from multiple fronts: (i) a lack of adequate understanding of the damage process zones associated with different types of small cracks; (ii) the in situ critical stress or strain conditions responsible for crack nucleation and propagation; (iii) numerical or analytical platforms that can account for the arbitrary nucleation and propagation of multiple cracks in a way that is consistent to the material failure/damaging descriptions. In this presentation, I shall first review the much improved understandings of how such composite materials fail at subply (microscopic) level under in situ loading, which was enabled only recently by the microscopic computer tomography, X-ray technology. The improved understanding thus allows us to construct realistic material failure descriptions based on the in situ stresses–displacement relations (as appose to the classic global laminar stress–strain relations). I shall then introduce a newly developed numerical platform named augmented finite element method (A-FEM), which can explicitly embed microscopic material failure descriptions (as cohesive failure models) in any structural models. Thus, the formation and propagation of nonlinearly coupled multiple cracks can take place at any locations dictated by the in situ local stresses. We shall demonstrate with several complex laminate systems that the numerical performance of the A-FEM based platform is very effective in dealing with such problems with very high fidelity. More critically, the method can effectively link the evolution of the complex damage processes with structural performance, which represents a big step towards the quantification of subcritical crack growth to final structural criticality...|$|R
30|$|For this reason, {{biocompatibility}} of {{new materials}} {{has been widely}} studied, and only {{after a lot of}} testing, they can become ready for use in biomedical areas. Titanium is one of these materials, and it is used for implant applications due to its favorable <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratio</b> and good biological performance in the bone, which is intimately dependent on surface properties such as surface roughness, surface chemistry, and wettability [1]. Such features of titanium have led researchers from many different fields to seek alternative materials. As a result, in recent years, a lot of progress has paved the way to creating innovative biomaterials in order to better existing treatments and develop new ones for improved quality of life of patients [2]. One of these materials that may either replace titanium dental implants or constitute an alternative as a new dental implant material is tantalum. This metal was first used for dental implants in 1962. However, problems with costs, metallurgical processes, and poor design have left this material in the background. Today, because of its biocompatible properties and biomechanical qualities associated with new production processes, newly obtained sources, and new dental implant designs, a growing interest in its use in implant dentistry has developed [3].|$|E
40|$|Compacted Graphite Iron, (CGI) {{is known}} to have {{outstanding}} mechanical strength and <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratio</b> as compared to conventional grey cast iron, (CI). The outstanding characteristics of CGI is due to its graphite particle shape, which is presented as compacted vermicular particle. The graphite is interconnected with random orientation and round edges, which results in higher mechanical strength. Whereas, graphite in the CI consists of a smooth-surfaced flakes that easily propagates cracks which results in weaker and brittle properties as compared to CGI. Owing to its improved properties, CGI is considered as the best candidate material in substituting grey cast iron that has been used in engine block applications for years. However, the smooth implementation of replacing CI with CGI has been hindered due to the poor machinability of CGI especially at high cutting speed. The tool life is decreased by 20 times when comparing CGI with CI under the same cutting condition. This study investigates the effect of using cryogenic cooling and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) during high-speed milling of CGI (grade 450). Results showed that, the combination of internal cryogenic cooling and enhanced MQL improved the tool life, cutting force and surface quality as compared to the conventional flood coolant strategy during high-speed milling of CGI...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{specific}} {{properties of}} polymer materials, they frequently replace traditional materials {{in many of}} it applications. Thus polymers have squeezed out metals and ceramics also in the bathtub due to many of its advantageous properties, such as corrosion resistance, <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratio,</b> colour design possibilities etc. At the manufacturing of multilayer bathtub items from polymers it is extremely important to ensure good and durable resistance between main material of the bath (such as polymethylmetacrylate, unsaturated polyestetr resins), primer and final coating. Insufficient adhesion between the layers of the multilayered bathtub material (especially near the edges and borings) {{is one of the}} main reasons of the spoilage production; additionally it is one of the most important factors decreasing exploitation life of such items, especially in the moisture sensitive environments like bathtub. Among the most crucial factors influencing strength of the adhesion joint in unmodified and reinforced layered polymer composites is macrostructure/surface quality of the coatable area, chemical nature of the contacting materials. These factors could be controled to greater extent by choosing suitable components (typically polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), fiber reinforced unsaturated polyester, primer) of the multilayered composite used for manufacturing of multilayered bathtub item as well as by using adequate technologies and technical means for pre-preperation of the surface, coating of the primer and preserving of the contact surfaces from the influence of external environment...|$|E
30|$|Advanced {{engineering}} ceramics {{have been}} widely used in the development of critical components, because of their superior characteristics such as electrical insulation, high hardness, low thermal expansion coefficient, corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance and low <b>weight-to-strength</b> <b>ratio</b> (Doloi et al. 2007; Hafezalkotob and Hafezalkotob 2016), and particularly these are extremely hard-to-cut materials due to extreme brittleness. Owing to these complexities, the task to machine a component with deterministic precision becomes challenging. In the recent past, laser beam machining (LBM) has been explored as an effective and emerging process for shaping ceramic materials. Pulsed laser is efficient for micromachining of hard-to-cut material because of low pulse width with high peak power. Nd:YAG laser beam emits light or photons of shorter wavelength generating high power densities and small, focused spot diameter better than the benefits offered by conventional CO 2 laser. Laser microgrooving operation considers various micromachining input process parameters like laser power, pulse width, spot size and cutting speed, which are quite compatible as well as in close agreement with derived energy equation of heat transfer (Chryssolouris 1991; Olsen and Alting 1995). Assist gas pressure also substantially affects the shape, geometry and dimension of cut during laser micromachining operation (Darwish et al. 2017; Farooq and Kar 1998). During square microgrooving operation, maintaining of squareness and depth is an essential factor to inherent focusing quality of laser machining process. The above-mentioned parameters are usually adjusted and utilized for machining to give the quality of microgroove desired, but this consumes exhaustive amounts of time and effort, and still there is scope of researchers for good-quality microgrooving conditions. Moreover, to improve its machining performance effectively and efficiently, the optimized process parameters and predictive models are also essentially required.|$|E
