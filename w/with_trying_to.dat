Jackie Robinson credited him <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> further the rights of African American players, but warned him that he said too much.

5|$|On 8 July 1644, the Earl of Essex sent a Parliamentarian force, led by Colonel Sir Robert Pye with Lieutenant Colonel Robert Blake as {{his second}} in command, to reclaim Taunton. They took the town without a fight, and {{surrounded}} the castle. The Royalist forces under Major William Reeve that were garrisoned at Taunton Castle surrendered and retreated to Bridgwater. Pye left Taunton {{shortly after the}} capture, leaving Blake to hold the town. Blake had an army of about 1,000 men, and was charged <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> blockade the roads to support the Earl of Essex's campaign in Devon and Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Tweedy was preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} Wilco as {{a viable}} band on the Reprise label and decided to add another guitarist to the band. Brian Henneman, the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets, was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist. Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan {{also contributed to the}} album. Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet. Howie Weinberg mastered the album, while Barbara Longo provided graphic design. Brian Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album, and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett. Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative environment than Uncle Tupelo, requesting songwriting contributions from other members. John Stirratt submitted three songs, hoping to become a secondary songwriter for Wilco. However, although the songs were recorded as demos, only one ("It's Just That Simple") was selected to appear on the album, and was the only Stirratt song, and the only song by Wilco not to have lyrics written by Tweedy, to appear on any Wilco album.|$|E

25|$|Human {{rights groups}} have {{regularly}} accused {{the government of}} arresting activists, journalists and bloggers to stamp out dissent among some religious communities.

25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks that may come from having sex were {{not as bad as}} the social risks that could come from remaining abstinent.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 2006, a Coca-Cola {{employee}} {{and two other}} people were arrested and charged <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> sell trade secrets information to the soft drink maker's competitor, PepsiCo for $1.5million. The recipe for Coca-Cola, perhaps the company's most closely guarded secret, was never in jeopardy. Instead, the information was related to a new beverage in development. Coca-Cola executives verified that the documents were valid and proprietary. At least one glass vial containing a sample of a new drink was offered for sale, court documents said. The conspiracy was revealed by PepsiCo, which notified the authorities when they were approached by the conspirators.|$|E
50|$|The Lions {{brought up}} their half century <b>with</b> a <b>try</b> <b>to</b> Matthew Luamanu two {{minutes into the}} second half.

David Smith scored his second try in the 55th minute to bring Wellington up to 71 points. Wairarapa Bush gained some momentum half way through the second with some hard runs and big hits, and it showed after a Scott Fuglistaller try, a slow kick by Daniel Kirkpatrick gave the chance for the Bush to charge down and they capitalized <b>with</b> a <b>try</b> <b>to</b> Joe Feast in the 65th minute.

Baum was the secretary of Aberdeen's Woman's Suffrage Club. Susan B. Anthony visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums.

25|$|Increasing {{insurance}} and fuel costs for owners coupled with looming Federal emissions and safety regulations would eventually {{put an end}} to the unrestricted, powerful engines of the 1960s. Safety, luxury and economy would become the new watch-words of this decade. Engine performance began declining in 1971 when GM issued a corporate edict mandating that all engines be capable of using lower-octane unleaded gasoline, which led to dramatic drops in compression ratios, along with performance and fuel economy. This, coupled <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> build cars as plush as GM's more luxurious Buicks and Oldsmobiles, contributed to the start of a slow decline of Pontiac in 1971.|$|E

25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E
25|$|LaRose {{was taken}} into custody in October 2009, and her arrest was made public on March 9, 2010, after seven alleged co-conspirators were arrested in Ireland (five of whom were later {{released}} by the Irish authorities). Among those arrested in Ireland (later released by the Irish authorities, but then arrested by U.S. authorities and charged as a co-defendant with LaRose in a superseding indictment) was Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, an American woman from Colorado, whose parents say she was recruited by LaRose. Specifically, LaRose was charged <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> recruit Islamic terrorists to wage violent Jihad and of plotting to murder the Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had drawn a cartoon of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, {{the rivalry}} between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak. On April 7, Joe Foss {{resigned}} as AFL commissioner. His successor was Oakland Raiders {{head coach and}} general manager Al Davis, who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise. No longer content <b>with</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under Davis started to recruit players already on NFL squads. Davis's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL. Although Davis's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues. Alarmed with the rate of spending in the league, Hilton Hotels forced Barron Hilton to relinquish his stake in the Chargers {{as a condition of}} maintaining his leadership role with the hotel chain.|$|E
