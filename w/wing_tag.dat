5000|$|Pérez then {{participated in}} four UWA-Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre shows, but {{was in the}} losing end of team team matches in each. Returning to WING, he formed a tag team with Yukihiro Kanemura, winning twice. On May 7, 1993, Pérez {{defeated}} Carl Yvon Ouellet. He an Kanemura then challenged The Headhunters for the vacant <b>WING</b> <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, but lost. They also lost a rematch, but Pérez defeated one of the Headhunters in singles competition. After wrestling a no contest, he won three consecutive contests to end this visit. He performed in two tag team matches in UWA, before returning to WING. In his return to Japan, Pérez lost a match to Dick Murdoch and three consecutive team contests involving the Headhunters, but won a battle royal. Pérez then entered a feud with Doug Gilbert, who wrestled masked as [...] "Freddy Krueger" [...] and defeated him in singles competition and a cage team match. Pérez then defeated a jobber and lost two team matches before returning to Puerto Rico. At Aniversario 1993, he wrestled Curtis Hughes {{as part of a}} tournament for the vacant WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship, but both were eliminated following a double countout. Upon returning to UWA, Pérez won one and lost two six man team matches, interrupting this to participate in WING's Best Champ, losing another team contest involving Doug Gilbert. After competing in another UWA event, Pérez returned to WING for a season. There he wrestled Gilbert to a double countout, but lost two more team matches involving him. On September 30, 1993, he joined Shoji Nakamaki to unsuccessfully challenge the Headhunters for the WING World Tag Team Championship. In November, he made a single appearance for UWA winning in a six-man tag team match. In WING Pérez formed a tag team with Bill DeMott winning two of their next three contests. On November 26, 1993, Pérez defeated Nobutaka Araya. He teamed with DeMott twice again, dividing results. Pérez then entered a winning streak of four one-on-one matches, including two over DeMott. In his last WING match, he was on the losing side of another tag team match involving Gilbert.|$|E
5000|$|At Aniversario 1991, Pérez {{reunited with}} Castillo to defeat Samu and Fatu. In {{the second half}} of 1991, Pérez went on a tour for the Universal Wrestling Association, where he debuted winning a six-man two out of three falls match. His second contest was under the same rules, but his team ended being disqualified. Pérez then teamed with Jeff [...] "Giant Warrior" [...] Bearden, but ended on the losing end of a tag team match against Mil Mascaras and El Canek. After losing another match, the team firmed a {{partnership}} with Ricky Santana. Together they won three consecutive six man two out of three falls matches. On November 24, 1991, Pérez unsuccessfully competed for the UWA Wirld Heavyweight Championship. He then returned to Japan, now performing for Wrestling International New Generation, losing his first tag team match. In his first singles match at WING, Pérez defeated Vic Steamboat. Before concluding this tour, he lost a match to Santana, who wrestled as [...] "The Iceman". From that point onwards, Pérez and Santana remained a mainstay team, being joined by other heels in six man tag team matches. They returned to the UWA winning consecutive matches, before evening the count by losing twice and then losing a six-man two out of three falls contest. On June 6, 1992, Pérez and Santana were scheduled to compete on World Championship Wrestling's tournament for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, but were unable to attend the event. To advance the storyline, their scheduled opponents, The Steiner Brothers, were declared winners by forfeit after they were said to have been [...] "involved in a car accident", with implications that they had actually been assaulted backstage. Upon returning to the UWA, he was involved in the losing side of a six-man tag team match. At Aniversario 1992, Pérez defeated Abdullah the Butcher by disqualification. He gathered a 2-2 record on his next UWA matches, before reuniting with Santana. Together, they won five consecutive matches. This winning streak was snapped by a team known as Los Misioneros de la Muerte (Negro Navarro, El Signo and El Texano), whom they had defeated during this run. Back at WING, Pérez successfully defended the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship. After losing a tag team match, he concluded this tour with a singles victory over William DeMott. After performing once in UWA, Pérez returned to Japan and won the WING World Tag Team Chsmpionship. He won three consecutive singles matches over Takashi Okano and Nobutaka Araya, before dropping the <b>WING</b> <b>Tag</b> Team Championship. He was then involved in the losing half of a team [...] "survival match". Pérez then made a brief tour to the United States for the International Championship Wrestling Alliance and Smoku Mountain Wrestling, but both of his contests were inconclusive.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{studies the}} {{quantity}} of feral pigeons (Columba livia f. domestica) and their daily activities in the locality of Smíchov in Prague. The research was focused on finding whether {{there is only one}} group of pigeons bound to the locality by daily activities connected to their consistent alimentary habits or whether there are two subgroups, one of them staying in the locality and the other one leaving to get food further from the city. A method of wing tags with further tracking and modern GPS telemetry was used for the research. A total of 10 birds was caught and marked by a <b>wing</b> <b>tag</b> and one subject was tracked by GPS telemetry.

40|$|Aims of {{this study}} were to apply AFLP markers to assess the genetic {{diversity}} and to define a marker-assisted traceability system in local chicken breeds. Data were based on 107 cocks of three different local chicken breeds from Veneto region (Italy) : Robusta (PRR: n= 54), Pepoi (PPP: n= 33) and Padovana (PPD: n= 20). Chickens were individually identified at birth with <b>wing</b> <b>tag</b> and reared in four different herds using a free-range system. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and AFLP analysis was performed according to the protocol described in Barcaccia et al. (1998). Values of expected heterozygosity (H) and polymorphism information content (PIC) at AFLP loci were calculated for each breed. Genetic similarities of all possible pairs of genotypes were estimates using a Jaccard index; the values obtained were subsequently used in a factorial analysis in order to define latent variables which explain the whole genetic similarity relation system between individuals. The average PIC index within breed was generally low: 24. 1 % for PRR, 23. 6 % for PPD and 17. 2 % for PPP. The average heterozygosities of the three breeds for all markers were 29. 5 % for PRR and PPD and 21. 3 % for PPP. In the majority of cases (from 90 % to 100 % of individuals within breed), marker-assisted traceability system used in this research correctly identified the breed of cocks. Hence, results are promising to identify biological tissue (meat, gamets, embryo, etc.) from these local chicken breeds. However, the method used in this study should be improved in terms of cost reduction for single sample, work effort, reproducibility and accuracy of results obtained...|$|E
40|$|Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is {{the second}} most popular poultry species in Europe with about 15 % of this market. This {{position}} is, in part, the consequence of moderate production costs originating from rapid growth rates and effective feed efficiency. Unfortunately, selection on growth traits may impair reproductive performances including fertility and laying rates. In fact, one of the major problems is the decrease in egg production which is mainly due to broodiness, an incubation behaviour that is still present in modern turkey breeder strains (up to 20 % to 30 % of breeder hens). Broodiness is generally expressed during the first weeks of the reproductive season. It is generally characterized by a marked reduction up to a total arrest of feed consumption during the days preceding broodiness. One of the objectives of our study was to collect field information from a relatively high population (47, 000) of turkey breeder hens in order to possibly anticipate or, at least limit broodiness and therefore facilitate flock management. Birds used were from two commercial strains, one defined as ‘‘heavy’’ (Big 6, Aviagen-BUT, Cheshire, UK, n ¼ 3; 360 females) while the other is considered as a ‘‘medium’’ type (BUT 9, Aviagen-BUT, 4, 200 females). Each strain was housed within two barns divided into 42 laying pens. Each broody female was individually identified and referenced by a coloured <b>wing</b> <b>tag.</b> The incidence and pattern of incubation behaviour along with the delay to return in lay were recorded throughout the period of reproduction. The results of this study indicate the possibility to develop a model of broodiness. A higher percentage of incubation behaviour was observed in the Big 6 hens compared to the BUT 9 (16 % versus 12 %). In both strains, the average duration of stay in broody pens increased with hen’s age. Hens expressing incubation behaviour after 18 – 20 weeks of lay tended not to return to egg production. Among females having experienced broodiness, those having experienced it twice stayed longer in broody pens than those having experienced it once. Among hens getting broody once, 17 – 19 % (BUT 9) or 23 % (Big 6) went back to broodiness a second time and among the latter ones, 15 – 22 % (BUT 9) or 20 – 26 % (Big 6) went back to broodiness a third time...|$|E

We investigated the survival of globally threatened Marbled Teal (Marmaronetta angustirostris) taken into captivity as ducklings when they became trapped in an irrigation channel, then released again after ﬂedging. We used <b>wing</b> <b>tags</b> and mark–recapture models to estimate the survival of re- leased teal. Ducklings rescued in 1996 (n = 53) were released soon after ﬂedging in September and their survival was modelled for seven months until April 1997. Their apparent monthly survival rate (lower than true survival owing to loss of <b>wing</b> <b>tags)</b> was 0. 85 ± 0. 12 (±s. e.). Ducklings rescued in 1997 (n = 44) were released together in February 1998 over ﬁve months after ﬂedging, and their survival was modelled for six months from February until August. Their apparent monthly survival rate was 0. 54 ± 0. 06. Ducklings rescued in 1998 (n = 159) were released in August–September soon after ﬂedging and their survival was modelled for 10 months from August until June. Their apparent monthly survival rate was 0. 83 ± 0. 07. Monthly survival was sig- niﬁcantly higher for the 1996 and 1998 cohort, suggesting that retaining birds in captivity after ﬂedging had a negative impact on post-release survival. When birds were released in February, a lower proportion survived until the breeding season three months later than when they were released ﬁve months earlier in September. Peer reviewe...|$|R

From 2003 till 2009, we monitored nesting pairs from incubation to fledging and compared nesting success for pairs nesting on rocks and trees. We captured chicks {{just prior to}} fledging to apply leg bands and <b>wing</b> <b>tags.</b> We also captured adults in June and attached solar-powered global positioning system (GPS) /satellite telemetry units, leg bands, and <b>wing</b> <b>tags.</b> We collected resighting data on marked birds opportunistically and telemetry data on tagged birds. We monitored 363 nesting pairs from 2003 to 2009. Most nesting failures occurred during the ~ 55 day incubation period. Overall, 50. 9 % of nesting pairs raised a chick to fledgling. Nesting substrate (i. e., rock or tree) did not influence nesting success. Between 2006 and 2009 we received reports of sightings for 21 individual birds and on 37 occasions (n = 1 – 6 sightings/bird). Thirty three sightings (89 %) came from South Korea between November and March, with other sightings in Mongolia, China, and Russia. We placed five GPS/satellite telemetry units on adult vultures in 2008 and 2009, but one did not work. We received 2, 767 locations from the other four units through 2009. Adult vultures used large foraging areas, covering a mean minimum convex polygon home range of 27, 025 ± 11, 922 SE km 2, a mean 95 % kernel home range of 4, 953 ± 1, 596 SE km 2, and a mean core home range (i. e., 50 % kernel) of 526 ± 168 SE km 2. Our data suggest that only fledgling and juvenile birds disperse from Mongolia in late autumn/early winter, while adults remain in near their nesting sites, but we require more data. We {{do not know if}} most of our tagged birds travel to Korea or the large number of reported re-sightings there result from the stronger bird watching tradition in that country compared with other areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{migration}} of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) from Canada and the United States to over-wintering sites in Mexico {{is one of}} the world’s most amazing biological phenomena, although recent threats make it imperative that the resources needed by migrating monarchs be conserved. The most important first step in preserving migration resources—determining the migration flyways—is also the most challenging because of the large-scale nature of the migration. Prior attempts to determine the flyways using mark-recapture techniques with <b>wing</b> <b>tags</b> gave some clues, but this important information has never been fully obtainable until now. In 2005 the citizen-science program, Journey North, initiated a project that asked participants to record sightings of overnight roosts of monarchs during their fall migration, and this project now provides an ideal way to illustrate the flyways used by monarchs on their way to Mexico, with the assumption that roost locations indicate migration routes. We used 3 years of this data to elucidate the flyways on a continent-wide scale, that revealed two distinct flyways, but only one appears to lead directly to Mexico. This main, ‘central’ flyway begins in the American Midwest states and southern Ontario, then continues south-southwest through the state...|$|R

40|$|From December 1985 to December 1988, an {{study was}} made of the {{functional}} significance of rook and jackdaw flocks with a view to identifying reasons for intra and interspecific flock cohesiveness. Flocks of rooks were investigated by way of behavioural observation for competitive heterogeneity and the impact of such on the dispersion of individual members. Thus, immature and adult birds were compared for their respective abilities to compete within foraging flocks. Evidence for kin selection in foraging flocks was investigated in jackdaws by way of behavioural observation of individually marked (<b>wing</b> <b>tagged)</b> birds and using DNA fingerprinting to ascertain the degree of relatedness between associating individuals. Interspecific associations were studied a) to identify the similarities and differences between foraging rooks and jackdaws and b) to provide hypotheses for functional flocking without cause for genetically related explanations. Immature rooks did not forage as efficiently as adults in larger flocks, and thus selected smaller flocks, with higher immature: adult ratios. Adult interference was a possible cause of immature dispersion. Kin selection was not found to be a significant component of co-foraging groups, though female jackdaws had higher than average levels of relatedness, possibly due to lower female than male dispersal. The daily behaviour of rooks and jackdaws was remarkably similar and 80 % of foraging flocks contained both species. Commonly co-occuring food resources, low direct resource competition and subsequent low levels of interspecific aggression were thought responsible for this association. In conclusion, competitive heterogeneity was found in rooks that effected individual dispersion, discouraging young birds rather than encouraging them, to remain within the colony. Likewise little evidence of kin selection was found in foraging jackdaws. Rooks and jackdaws associated together frequently, on the basis, it was suggested, of where one species was feeding, the other was also likely to forage successfully...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{occurrence}} of band-tailed pigeons (Columba fasciata) three mineral sites in Western Oregon was studied during the summers of 1974 - 1976. Objectives {{of the study}} were o: determine seasonal patterns of utilization of mineral sites by pigeons of different sex and age classes; determine productivity of pigeon populations associated with Mineral sites; determine fidelity of pigeons to mineral sites; and determine sizes of pigeon populations utilizing miner al sites. Study sites included two sites (Long Tom and Nashville) where pigeons were hunted during the Oregon band-tailed pigeon hunting season and one site where hunting was prohibited (Finley). Observations of pigeons marked with patagial <b>wing</b> <b>tags</b> provided information on daily and seasonal patterns, fidelity of pigeons to mineral sites, and sizes of pigeon populations using the mineral sites. Productivity was determined from counts of adult and immature pigeons recorded at 15 min intervals. Observations occurred daily between sunrise and 1200 h at each site during 2 of the 3 years. Band-tailed pigeons were associated with mineral sites from May to September, coinciding with the breeding season. The most intensive period of use of mineral was during August when the majority of immatures fledged. Males and females frequented mineral sites during different time periods and males were associated with mineral for longer seasonal periods than were females. Cloudy and wet weather had adverse affects on the numbers of pigeons visiting the sites. Adult pigeons had high fidelity to mineral sites, both among years and during each breeding season. Interchange was frequently observed between two closely adjacent sites. Estimates of sizes of populations indicated that between 1800 and 2500 pigeons were associated with the three sites in 1976. Patterns of nesting and productivity varied among the sites. Pigeons associated with the site where hunting was prohibited (Finley) had approximately twice the amount of production as did pigeons at the two sites where hunting occurred. Most pigeons associated with the Finley site and probably the Nashville site were involved in multiple nestings, but the majority of the birds associated with the Long Tom site nested only once per season. Patterns of utilization of mineral and productivity displayed by pigeons associated with the Nashville site were probably representative of the reproductive activities of the majority of band-tailed pigeons which bred in Oregon...|$|R
