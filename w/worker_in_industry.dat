50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Third Five-Year Plan, agricultural yields remained less than required to permit diverting resources to the support of industrial development. In 1986 agriculture still accounted for about 44 percent of national income (the figure for developed nations is closer to 10 percent). The agricultural sector also occupied some 66 percent of the work force—a higher percentage than in 1976 and 1980. Worse still, the output per agricultural worker had slipped during the plan period, falling even farther behind the increasing output per <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> <b>industry.</b> In 1980 more than three agricultural workers were needed to produce as much national income as a single industrial or construction worker. By 1985 an industrial worker produced more than six times as much as an agricultural worker.|$|E

We find that the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) varies by province. One of the reasons that FDI can have differential effects is that the type of FDI (export vs. import-oriented) varies substantially across the provinces. Export-oriented FDI raises the wages of <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>industries</b> that rely more on unskilled workers and lowers the wages of <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>industries</b> that rely more on skilled workers, lowering the industry differential. ...|$|R
