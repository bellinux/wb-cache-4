40|$|The {{establishment}} of more severe hydrological environmental constraints, usually as seasonal minimum flows (ϕ) and maximum ramping rates (ρ), on hydropower operation {{is a growing}} trend. This paper presents {{a study on the}} influence of ϕ and ρ on the water values (WV) of a real hydropower plant that participates in the Spanish day-ahead electricity market. For this purpose, a master-slave algorithm, based on stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) and deterministic mixed integer linear programming (DMILP), is used on a real hydropower plant. The master module, based on SDP, has a yearly planning period with weekly time steps and considers three state variables: stored water volume in the reservoir {{at the beginning of each}} week; weekly water inflow; and average weekly energy price. The slave module, based on DMILP, has a weekly planning period with hourly time steps and considers many features of the hydropower plant operation, such as: start-up costs, evaporation, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>costs,</b> etc. The results indicate that WV of a hydropower plant are very sensitive to the presence of these constraints; ϕ especially during the wettest season and ρ during the driest one. As the severity of ϕ and ρ increase, WV increase and decrease, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, Europe was {{dominated}} by state-owned, vertically integrated railroads. Lately, European Union (EU) policies and relevant legislation have introduced the legal separation between railroad operations and infrastructure management. Thus, the railroad infrastructure management companies have started applying charges (termed access pricing) to railroad companies for using infrastructure. Although European policies and legislation set the basic access pricing principles, they did not provide specific rules or methods for deriving infrastructure charging systems. An access pricing system for suburban (commuter) rail services was developed. An overview of practices in EU member states and the United States is presented. The basic principles and economic characteristics of infrastructure charging are outlined. The proposed structure of the infrastructure charging system is discussed, with {{a distinction between the}} basic charge - which includes costs for train planning and line operations, infrastructure damage and <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>costs,</b> and quality of services - and additional components. Each component is mathematically expressed. The proposed charging system does not include costs related to train operations. To test the robustness of the proposed system, it is applied to the suburban rail services provided by the Greek company AMEL, with trains running on the Greek railroads' infrastructure. The proposed infrastructure charging system can be applied to any railroad by changing the variable values...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the influence of maximum ramping rates (ρ) on the water values of a real hydropower plant. For this purpose, a master-slave algorithm, based on stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP), is used. The master module, based on SDP, has a 1 -year planning period with weekly time steps and considers 3 state variables: stored volume of water in the reservoir {{at the beginning of each}} week; weekly water inflow; and average weekly energy price. The slave module, based on MILP, has a 1 -week planning period with hourly time steps and considers: maximum legal and minimum technical storage capacities; maximum and minimum technical stored volumes for power generation; maximum and minimum flows released through the hydro units, the bottom outlets and the spillways according to the stored volume; one different power-discharge piecewise linear non-concave curve, as a function of the initial and estimated final stored volumes; start-up and shut-down costs of the hydro units; <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>costs</b> of the hydro units caused by power variations; hourly evaporation losses according to the stored volume; hourly water inflows and energy prices; and up and down ρ. The results indicate that the water values of the hydropower plant are very sensitive to the presence of ρ; especially during the months with low water inflows. Water values decrease quadratically when increasing ρ...|$|E
40|$|Economic theory advocates {{marginal}} cost pricing for efficient utilisation of transport infrastructure. A {{growing body of}} literature has emerged {{on the issue of}} marginal infrastructure <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>costs,</b> but the majority of the work is focused on costs for infrastructure maintenance. Railway track renewals are a substantial part of an infrastructure manager 9 ̆ 2 s budget, but in disaggregated statistical analyses, they cause problems for traditional regression models since there is a piling up of values of the dependent variable at zero. Previous econometric work has sought to circumvent the problem by aggregation in some way. In this paper we work with disaggregate (track-section) data, including the zero observations, but apply censored and sample selection regression models to overcome the bias that would result from estimation using OLS. We derive track renewal cost elasticities with respect to traffic volumes and in turn marginal renewal costs using Swedish railway renewal data over the period 1999 to 2009. Our paper is the first paper in the literature that we are aware of to report usage elasticities specifically for renewal costs and therefore adds important new evidence to the previous literature where there is a paucity of studies on renewals and considerable uncertainty over the effects of rail traffic on renewal costs. In the Swedish context, we find that the inclusion of marginal track renewal costs in the track access pricing regime, which currently only reflects marginal maintenance costs, would add substantially to the existing track access charge...|$|E
40|$|This is the author's own {{final version}} of a book chapter. The book, Integrated futures and {{transport}} choices is available from: [URL] and Transport Policy: In recent years there have been increasingly strong linkages between national fiscal systems and environmental/transport objectives. Within the European Union, European Commission (EC) policy has been outlined in documents such as ‘Towards Fair and Efficient Pricing’ (1), and ‘Fair Payment for Infrastructure Use’ (2). In summary these well-researched documents advocate that transport infrastructure charges should normally reflect the marginal social costs {{at the point of}} use. These marginal social costs should include not only marginal <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>costs</b> on infrastructure, but also ‘external’ costs imposed on society, the environment and the wider economy through accidents, pollution, emission of climate change gases, congestion etc [...] While regulatory and physical design mechanisms are also recognised as having an important role to play, it is tax and charging instruments that the European Commission and national states see as being most effective at encouraging efficient and sustainable transport systems in the longer term. In practice, moving towards such a strategic policy aim has proved problematic. In the first place, transport taxation is an increasingly political sensitive subject, as the autumn 2000 ‘fuel price’ protests in several European countries showed. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that marginal changes in the fiscal framework would provide sufficient encouragement to make a real difference in consumer behaviour. It requires a major restructuring {{to address the issue of}} environmental performance. This chapter therefore explores the potential to move towards more radical actions in a way that might succeed in overcoming the shortcomings experienced by more short term strategies. Structure of the Chapter: This chapter first considers the purposes of taxation and the implications of this for the use of fiscal policies in the new transport agenda of managing transport demand. It then considers the fiscal policies that can be used to influence consumer behaviour in acquiring and using different forms of transport, before going on to explain how these policies have – or have not – been used in the recent past in the UK. The chapter then argues that the use of fiscal policies has been quite limited, particularly in comparison to other countries. It therefore advocates and examines the implications of the adoption of a wider range of fiscal policies, as part of a wider package of economic instruments and regulations to achieve transport demand management in an effective manner that also recognises the political sensitivities involved...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 32 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 8 - 11 July 2013 "Transport and Sustainable Infrastructure", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Long term sustainable transport, including infrastructure costs and recovery, as well as associated externalities, has become an increasing concern in recent years due to social and environmental issues. This paper considers infrastructure provision costs and {{the significance of the}} so-called ‘hidden costs’ which can benefit one transport mode at the expense of another and lead to inefficient transport pricing. It is important to consider the cost and value of each transport mode in terms of long-term sustainability, energy efficiency and environmental issues. Finally, consideration must be given to service quality to the user – whether in the private or in the commercial world. Many of the costs of providing freight and passenger road and rail transport services have been externalised in the past and passed on to the public in general – including non-users of transport. This should be seen as a de-facto form of cross-subsidisation which can lead to decisions being made for infrastructure investments which may seem appropriate in the immediate short term, but which may have negative effects in the long term. Infrastructure costs include the cost of providing railways and the public transport infrastructure of roads, both rural and urban, as well as the ways of redeeming these costs from users. Fair infrastructure charging principles must be applied which consider the following points: · The capital cost the rail system, as well as road infrastructure development and the overall costs to the economy in general; · The contribution to pavement <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>costs</b> by various users, and · Space occupation and other infrastructure facilities for specific users. In addition, transport cost externalities must also be considered and they include: · Accident costs; · Congestion costs; · Exhaust emission and pollution costs including Greenhouse and carbon issues; · Noise costs; · Traffic policing costs, and · Energy efficiency and resource consumption. Consideration is given to these issues and their relevance to South African conditions in this study. Background details relating to earlier studies which have appeared are included since many are not well known. Extracts from these reports support many of the conclusions drawn in this paper. It {{is important to note that}} quantification of some external costs has been difficult and controversial in the past but more sophisticated scientific evaluation is advancing such work at a rapid rate. It is also important to appreciate the fact that internalising some of these costs may not be considered ‘politically correct’ or justifiable but it is important to be aware of the consequences of these costs – broadly and across society in general.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the biology of stress and {{resilience}} and their biomarkers in humans from the system science perspective. A stressor pushes the physiological system away from its baseline state towards a lower utility state. The physiological system may return towards the original state in one attractor basin but may be shifted to a state in another, lower utility attractor basin. While some physiological changes induced by stressors may benefit health, {{there is often a}} chronic <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>cost</b> due to implementing changes to enable the return of the system to its baseline state and maintain itself in the high utility baseline attractor basin following repeated perturbations. This cost, also called allostatic load, is the utility reduction associated with both a change in state and with alterations in the attractor basin that affect system responses following future perturbations. This added cost can increase the time course of the return to baseline or the likelihood of moving into a different attractor basin following a perturbation. Opposite to this is the system’s resilience which influences its ability to return to the high utility attractor basin following a perturbation by increasing the likelihood and/or speed of returning to the baseline state following a stressor. This review paper is a qualitative systematic review; it covers areas most relevant for moving the stress and resilience field forward from a more quantitative and neuroscientific perspective...|$|R
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} adoption of mobile devices with limited energy storage capacity, {{on the one}} hand, and more {{awareness of the environmental}} impact of massive data centres and server pools, on the other hand, have both led to an increased interest in energy management algorithms. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} present several new constant factor approximation algorithms for energy aware scheduling problems where the objective is to minimize weighted completion time plus the cost of the energy consumed, in the one machine non-preemptive setting, while allowing release dates and deadlines. Unlike previous known algorithms these new algorithms can handle general job-dependent energy cost functions, extending the application of these algorithms to settings outside the typical CPU-energy one. These new settings include problems where in addition, or instead, of energy costs we also have maintenance <b>costs,</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> replacement <b>costs,</b> etc., which in general depend on the speed at which the machine runs but also depend on the types of jobs processed. Our algorithms also extend to approximating weighted tardiness plus energy cost, an inherently more difficult problem that has not been addressed in the literature. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

40|$|The current {{concern with}} {{sustainability}} rightly requires those involved with transport to consider carefully {{the sustainability of}} the transport sector, and in particular its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. However, {{it is important to}} remember that greenhouse gases are just one of the costs of transport systems, and it makes no sense therefore to take decisions about transport systems based on the impact on greenhouse gas emissions alone. Against this background, the paper discusses the state of research in estimating marginal external costs of road transport and presents the results of two case studies. These suggest that under peak traffi c conditions congestion costs are by far the most important externalities of road use. Accidents, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>and</b> noise <b>costs</b> all appear to be more important than global warming. These results stress that reducing global warming costs, important though they are, should not be the sole priority of transport decisions.

40|$|Due to {{operation}} {{cost and}} environmental concerns, there is ongoing {{effort to reduce}} the fuel consumption and emissions in all transportation sectors including marine transportation. In the last decade, the development of diesel electric propulsion system {{have made it possible}} to be installed on many offshore installation vessels. Electric propulsion installation becomes a prevailing trend mainly due to increased demands for energy-efficient and low emission vessels with high availability and reliability. Combining gensets with ESD has shown through different usage strategies to have a potential for improving the fuel economy as well as enhancing the genset dynamics which reduces fuel consumption, emissions, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> <b>and</b> maintenance <b>cost.</b> This thesis has presented optimization methods to find optimal operating point for gensets under different power demands, with regard to fuel consumption and NOx emission. Three power system configurations for an offshore construction vessel will be explored in this study, 1) marine power plant with large gensets, 2) marine power plant with small gensets which has the same cylinder characteristic with 1), and 3) marine power plant with small gensets which has different cylinder characteristic with 1) and 2). Optimization simulations were accomplished in Matlab. A typical power demand step-wise from 10 % to 100 % MCR has been tested in all configurations, and results have illustrated good fuel economy in configuration 2 over configuration 1. Fuel consumption was also high in configuration 3, however, it was caused by its higher optimum specific fuel consumption feature. Monte Carlo method was applied to test the sensitivity of cost function with slightly varying optimum engine operating points for one case, where it gave consistent fuel consumption and has shown the validity of optimization results. Considering AC/DC converter efficiency degrades especially at low load percentage, a study has shown that fuel efficiency is even better in configuration 2 than one in configuration 1. Multi-objective simulations on configuration 2 was presented with 3 different load condition, 20 %, 45 % and 70 %. It illustrates different shape of pareto front, which is a group of non-dominating optimums. Generally, it showed that {{in order to reduce the}} NOx emission, fuel consumption is required to be compromised. Due to the limitation of accessible specific NOx map, limited case study was accomplished. However, the same optimization method can apply to these maps when it is accessible. Besides, results have indicated by integrating ESD led to fuel consumption by 5. 9 %, 4. 8 % and 6. 7 % in configuration 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Furthermore, configuration 1 has shown a lower fuel consumption by 6. 5 % and 12. 7 % before using ESD, and 4. 9 %, while 10. 9 % after integrating ESD during a certain operational profile. The fuel saving potential was proved to be larger in low-power engine configuration for an assumed offshore construction vessel. The performance of the proposed technique was validated through simulation results, and its advantages were demonstrated...|$|R
