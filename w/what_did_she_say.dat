6000|$|ESTHER--[Betraying {{a sudden}} frightened jealousy.] What do you mean, Lily? What {{are you so}} mysterious about? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> What--? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{my little}} daughter, what is it? Has some one sent for us? Is it {{the letter from}} Emma Sessions? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> in it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't you speak?" [...] he asked, suspiciously. [...] "Has {{she been}} telling you a pack of lies about me? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> when she came home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strangers do not {{interest}} me, your Majesty. But the Princess Gloria is very interesting--very interesting, indeed! <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>say,</b> Sire? Will <b>she</b> marry me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] responded Tom Flynn {{with some}} cheerfulness. [...] "P'r'aps we may. But {{how about your}} wife, Old Man? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>SHE</b> <b>say</b> to it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish he would. He {{could not}} do a wiser thing. But {{of course it is}} entailed--there's always a {{provision}} of nature for starving the younger branches. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> to Percy's absence!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, {{she tried}} to found a salon, and only succeeded in opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> about Mr. Dorian Gray?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Henry {{sipped his}} {{champagne}} in a meditative manner. [...] "At what particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> in answer? Perhaps you {{forgot all about}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|When Osborne {{heard that}} his friend had found her, he made hot and anxious {{inquiries}} regarding the poor child. How was she? How did she look? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> His comrade took his hand, and {{looked him in}} the face.|$|E
6000|$|Writing to Mr. Macallan, at a {{time when}} she was married to another man--a man to whom she had engaged herself before she met with Mr. Macallan <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> <b>She</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "When I think of your life sacrificed to that wretched woman, my heart bleeds for you." [...] And, again, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "If it had been my unutterable {{happiness}} to love and cherish the best, the dearest of men, what a paradise of our own we might have lived in, what delicious hours we might have known!" ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. Yes; {{and what}} will <b>she</b> <b>say</b> to that? <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> to it? Just that her father's wishes are sacred to her, and that she shall always look up to me as her {{guardian}} whether I care to face the responsibility or not. Refuse! You might as well refuse to accept the embraces of a boa constrictor when once it gets round your neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's got {{too much}} to say," [...] thought Marilla, [...] "but she might be trained out of that. And there's nothing rude or slangy in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>say.</b> <b>She's</b> ladylike. It's likely her people were nice folks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{there no}} {{servants}} in the house? It looks,--it looks--. But I am {{the last person}} in the world to form a harsh judgment of a young woman at such a moment as this. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> in her letter, Fred?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea; {{but when}} she read the letter that overthrew her hopes, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> but that 'her {{servants}} must not grow gray-headed with waiting till she was set free'! So she would have me make the case known to Sir Parson, and we had them married in the parish church two days since, they being both good Protestants." ...|$|E
6000|$|Surely Ayesha {{was talking}} to me! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> I could not catch her words, but I caught her {{laughter}} and knew that after her fashion {{she was making a}} mock of me. My eyelids were dragged down as though with heavy sleep; it was difficult to lift them. At last they were open and I saw Ayesha seated on her couch before me and--this I noted at once--with her lovely face unveiled. I looked about me, seeking Umslopogaas and Hans. But they were gone as I guessed they must be, since otherwise Ayesha would not have been unveiled. We were quite alone. She was addressing me and in a new fashion, since now she had abandoned the formal [...] "you" [...] and was using the more impressive and intimate [...] "thou," [...] much as is the manner of the French.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said; [...] "I understand. The vapour of {{the stuff}} {{poisoned}} me, but it is passing now. Adams, ask that lady how many men she's got with her. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> About five hundred? Well, then, let her attack Harmac at once. The outer and inner gates are down; the Fung think they have raised the devil and will run. She can inflict a defeat on them from which they will not recover for years, only {{it must be done}} at once, before they get their nerve again, for, after all, they are more frightened than hurt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are wrong, both of you--you harm each other. If youth once {{falls under}} the {{influence}} of a shadowy terror, it imagines there will never be full sunlight again; its first calamity it fancies will last a lifetime. <b>What</b> more <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> Anything more?" ...|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. [to Gunner] You {{hear what}} Mrs Tarleton says. Well, {{in this house}} {{everybody}} <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> or out they go.|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY. Thank God--at last! Isn't it hell--all these fools! I couldn't get to you. What did Old Lady Grundy {{have to say}} to you? I saw her {{giving me}} a hard look. Was it about us--the old stuff? (Eileen nods with downcast eyes.) <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> Never mind now. You can tell me in a minute. It's my turn next. (His eyes glance towards the scales.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what answer did you get?" [...] Archie {{had found}} himself obliged to {{repudiate}} with alacrity the attack upon his courage which {{his brother had}} so plainly made, but beyond that, the subject was one which was not pleasing to him. [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> to you?" [...] asked his brother, who {{had no idea of}} sparing Archie's feelings in such a matter.|$|E
6000|$|The eminent Q.C. let {{the paper}} drop from his huge red {{hands in the}} {{intensity}} of his surprise, while his jaw fell in unison at so startling and almost incredible a piece of intelligence. [...] "Nevitt knows all!" [...] he exclaimed, half incredulous. [...] "He means to ruin us! And he told this to Gwendoline! Gone down to Mambury! Oh no, Minnie, impossible! You must have made some mistake. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> exactly? Did she mention Mambury?" ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the crash}} site, Sid wakes {{up to the}} sound of Maggie bathing in a nearby pond. When he asks <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> smelled bad and Sid should take the hint. He does so and strips down, jumping in with her. They wrestle in the water and Sid tries to pull her under. When they surface near the bank, Sid tries to force himself on her, but Maggie fights him off. Frustrated, Sid gives up and Maggie looks around, confused: [...] "What is it? You stopped?" [...] Excited at the {{prospect}} of a woman who likes it rough, Sid proceeds to slap Maggie repeatedly to her cries of encouragement.|$|R
60|$|Marilla {{opened her}} lips to <b>say</b> <b>she</b> knew not what of apology or deprecation. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> was a {{surprise}} to herself then and ever afterwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, Anna-Liisa {{tries to}} drown herself {{to join her}} dead baby but she is saved by Johannes. After praying God, she knows <b>what</b> <b>she</b> must <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> forgives everybody including Mikko and accepts to marry him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--ay: <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> Let's see. I was oiling my working-day boots {{without taking}} 'em off, and wi' my head hanging down, when she just brushed {{on by the}} garden hatch like a flittering leaf. 'Ann,' I said, says I, and then,--but, Dick I'm afeard 'twill be no help to thee; for we were such a rum couple, your mother and I, leastways one half was, that is myself--and your mother's charms was more in the manner than the material." ...|$|E
6000|$|When had {{the letter}} been posted? At least, {{he might have}} looked at the mark on the envelope. Was it a year ago? Was it lately? The letter did not look {{as though it had been}} lying about the club for many months. Had it not still the odour of those dreadful Parma violets? She must have seen in the paper his return from Africa, wounded and ill. And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> Did she merely write a few cold words of {{congratulation}} or--more? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{know just}} what it is, darling,' cried the girl, putting her arm around her mother's waist caressingly, and drawing her down to kiss her face {{half a dozen times}} over in her {{outburst}} of sympathy. 'That horrid old Miss Catherine has been here again, I'm sure, for I saw her going out of the shop just now, and she's been saying something or other spiteful, as she always does, to vex my dearie. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> to you to-day, now do tell us, duckie mother?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little Joscelyn wasn't {{much of a}} talker," [...] said Aunty Nan dreamily. [...] "She {{was kind}} of a quiet child. But you {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say.</b> And I've never forgotten little Joscelyn." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} of Nadia (Uzma Hassan) and Sikander (Omair Rana)'s marriage. Sikander is paralyzed walking into wheelchair. Their student (Raheed Muhammad Alam) usually comes in their gone for assistance. Nadia goes for office {{and comes with}} him. Once, he touches her while buying milk. She becomes more afraid and her husband asks her and she tells her the reality. Her husband thinks she is still hiding something. She buys shirt for the student, whom she loves secretly. She hides this until he tells her husband. He becomes more angry on Nadia that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>says</b> that if <b>she</b> bought one shirt for him then what happens {{but he said it}} affects him as his wife buys gifts for other guy. He decides to divorce her and she happily goes with that student and Sikander walks without wheelchair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] said Sophia. Sophia's wit {{was usually}} ready enough, {{but at that}} moment she could not resolve with what words she might make the most {{appropriate}} reply to her--friend. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> was rather lame, but it was not dangerous.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where {{does she}} live?' cried Nicholas. 'What have you learnt of her history? Has she a father--mother--any brothers--sisters? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> How came {{you to see}} her? Was she not very much surprised? Did you say how passionately I have longed to speak to her? Did you tell her where I had seen her? Did you tell her how, and when, and where, and how long, and how often, I have thought of that sweet face which came upon me in my bitterest {{distress}} like a glimpse of some better world--did you, Newman--did you?' ...|$|E
60|$|They recover him again, {{and tell}} him he must be composed, and bear this like a man. Somebody says he must think of his poor mother. It is because he does think of her so much, that the happy news had {{overpowered}} him. They crowd about him, {{and tell him}} that the truth has gone abroad, and that all the town and country ring with sympathy for his misfortunes. He has no ears for this. His thoughts, as yet, have no wider range than home. Does she know it? <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> who told her? He can speak of nothing else.|$|E
60|$|It {{was terrible}} that {{after three years}} the mere sight of her {{handwriting}} should have power to throw him into this state of eager, passionate anguish. He was seized with the old panic, the terrified perception of his surrender, of his utter weakness, which made flight the only possible resistance. That was why he had destroyed the letter unread. When Mrs. Wallace was many thousand miles away {{there had been no}} danger in confessing that he loved her; but now it was different. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> in the letter? Had she in some feminine, mysterious fashion discovered his secret? Did she ask him to go and see her? James remembered one of their conversations.|$|E
5000|$|Marina goes to Khavar and <b>says</b> that <b>she</b> {{has been}} {{contacting}} him for days, {{and that she}} is clueless <b>what</b> to <b>do.</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that being quiet will make them both get arrested if they don't straighten up there story. <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that Kesar was her husband too, and if Khavar supports her then she can put a case on Areeba for poisoning Kesar, just for some property. Khavar {{says that he is}} a sinner and that he can't sin any more and that Javad's sins are all because of him ...|$|R
60|$|What the {{destitute}} {{subject of}} such an offer tried to say, I need not repeat. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say,</b> I could more easily tell, if it were worth the telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could never relate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, a great deal. That is--no, not much, but <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> {{was very}} interesting. Her dying so suddenly" [...] (slowly, and with {{hesitation}} it was spoken), [...] "and you--none of you being at home--and your father, I thought--perhaps {{had not been}} very fond of her." ...|$|R
