5|$|When Taylor was {{ten years}} old, several years before started the sport, her {{grandmother}} made a comment to her after having seen the game that Taylor could play and one day make the Paralympics. Only <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> high school, in August 2009, did she start playing the sport. After only a month playing the sport, Taylor was selected for the New South Wales team that competed at the 2009 National Championships, where she was the second leading scorer in what was her first major competition. Playing again for New South Wales, she competed in the 2011 National Championships, and was named the tournament's MVP. At the 2012 Australian National Championships, her New South Wales team finished second, and she was awarded the Ladies' MVP and the Kenaghan Medal, which was awarded {{at the end of}} the tournament.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the afternoon of the}} Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the project, de Campi read over 4000 pages of Archie comic books She drew {{inspiration}} for the story from the 1940s era of the series, when she says Archie Andrews' girlfriends Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge had [...] "more edge". Her scripts were subject to notes and tweaks from Archie Comics and Fox, but de Campi described both licensors as [...] "extremely mellow, pleasant and easy to work with". Fox's primary concern was why the Predator, {{who is known for}} choosing challenging prey, would be interested in teenagers, but a suitable explanation was included in the story. She expected some of the notes, such as being told, [...] "Alex, you can't make jokes about child predation in an Archie book". Other times, she was surprised when she did not receive notes, such as her use of emojis for the Predator's speech. She was pleased <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> add depth to Dilton Doiley, a character she feels is often overlooked in regular Archie comics. The choice of whether Archie Andrews would survive the series or not was changed several times during scripting, and a final decision was not made until the last draft of the script.|$|E

2500|$|Fans, {{aware that}} Miranda Montgomery, Bianca's first child, {{who was the}} result of rapist Michael Cambias, speculated Zach Slater as the child's {{biological}} father; Zach was Michael's older brother. Fans theorized that Bianca wanted a baby closely related to Miranda and asked Zach to father the child.

2500|$|Case-law {{where this}} test applies {{includes}} McLoughlin v O'Brian [...] AC 410, {{in which the}} husband and children of the claimant {{were involved in a}} car accident that was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The claimant found out about the accident an hour later and, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the hospital two hours later, one child had already died. She saw her husband and children suffering and suffered shock, depression and a change of personality. The court established a spectrum of proximity; a pedestrian should be able to withstand seeing the accidents that occur in everyday life, but a family member of the victims will inevitably suffer greater emotional harm. Nonetheless, simply seeing the aftermath of the accident and not witnessing it is insufficient proximity. Similarly, seeing a video of the accident is insufficient.|$|E
