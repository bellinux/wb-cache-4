5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo <b>women</b> <b>when</b> coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E

The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|Born in Moss Side, Manchester to {{politically}} active parents, Pankhurst was introduced {{at the age}} of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years older than her, known for supporting women's rights to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried <b>women.</b> <b>When</b> that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her gender. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.|$|E

5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for <b>women.</b> <b>When</b> the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuality {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for <b>women.</b> <b>When</b> she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant <b>women.</b> <b>When</b> taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an {{executive}} in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one, but is lured {{back with a}} new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being {{the son of an}} erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor and bad luck in relationships. Chandler marries Monica in season seven, and they adopt twins {{at the end of the}} series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times. Matthew Perry has expressed his similarities to the character, such as his need to break an awkward silence with a joke and difficulties with <b>women</b> <b>when</b> first joining the show.|$|E
5|$|Moderate wind gusts {{throughout}} the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000people were without power, {{one of the worst}} power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an office building in East Rutherford, causing injuries to two <b>women</b> <b>when</b> they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50million (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The ao dai is {{featured}} in {{an array of}} Vietnam-themed or related movies. In Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Robin Williams's character is wowed by ao dai-clad <b>women</b> <b>when</b> he first arrives in Saigon. The 1992 films Indochine and The Lover inspired several international fashion houses to design ao dai collections, including Prada's SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film The White Silk Dress (2007), an ao dai is the sole legacy that the mother of a poverty-stricken family has to pass on to her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an ao dai-inspired design. Vietnamese designers created ao dai for the contestants in the Miss Universe beauty contest, which was held July 2008 in Nha Trang, Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for <b>women.</b> <b>When</b> a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
