25|$|The Law on Fisheries {{requires}} that {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the Law on Fisheries {{then goes on to}} state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls {{for the federal government to}} issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock that <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.|$|E
25|$|Concerning energy, Lomborg {{asserts that}} oil {{is not being}} {{depleted}} as fast as is claimed, and that improvements of technology will provide people with fossil fuels for years to come. The author further asserts that many alternatives already exist, and that with time they will replace fossil fuels as an energy source. Concerning other resources, such as metals, Lomborg suggests that based on their price history {{they are not in}} short supply. Examining the challenge of collecting sufficient amounts of water, Lomborg says that wars <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> erupt over water because fighting such wars is not cost-effective (one week of war with the Palestinians, for instance, would cost Israel more than five desalination plants, according to an Israeli officer). Lomborg emphasizes the need for better water management, as water is distributed unequally around the world.|$|E
25|$|On January 25, 2014, UTA {{announced}} it {{had won a}} federal grant {{with the intention of}} establishing a new TRAX line that would directly connect the Salt Lake International Airport with the University of Utah. The former University Line originally ran along much of this route, but was replaced by the Red and Green Lines when the Mid-Jordan and West Valley extensions were completed in 2011. The west and east sides of Salt Lake City thus have no access to each other via TRAX without a transfer. The new line would use existing rail and trains, but more funding is required for software development, minor signal adjustments, and operator training. UTA is seeking these funds, but has no estimate for when the new line could begin operation. The new line would not only provide a direct east-west connection, it would also increase the frequency of TRAX service to downtown stations. UTA has yet to announce the new line's name (color). However, it has indicated the new line <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> connect {{all the way to the}} University Medical Center station, but may stop at the Stadium station instead.|$|E

500|$|Both {{isotopes}} {{of natural}} europium have larger mass excesses than sums {{of those of}} their potential alpha daughters plus that of an alpha particle; therefore, they (stable in practice) may alpha decay to promethium. Research at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso showed that europium-151 experimentally decays to promethium-147 with the half-life of 5years. It {{has been shown that}} europium is [...] "responsible" [...] for about 12grams of promethium in the Earth's crust. Alpha decays for europium-153 have not been found yet, and its theoretically calculated half-life is so high (due to low energy of decay) that this process <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> be observed in the near future.|$|E

500|$|The {{collective}} had {{pitched a}} Wham City television sitcom to Adult Swim before, {{but according to}} Resnick, the network insisted that [...] "no one would ever watch more than one episode." [...] Resnick named Mr. Show with Bob and David, The Kids in the Hall and the Upright Citizens Brigade as influences on the special. Dave Hughes, creator of the series Off the Air, who had discussed with the group about developing a series, took note of Resnick's sketch and helped the collective develop it into an infomercial. After airing the special, Wham City featured the skit for their comedy tour of New York City. Resnick informed Network Awesome that they <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> produce any more fake infomercials, and that O'Brien {{is working with the}} network to create something that viewers will [...] "stumble on unintentionally." ...|$|E

Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script. He also felt that the [...] "relentless self-awareness isn’t amusing anymore". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote [...] "If it is indeed true that somewhere out in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. I sincerely hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me." [...] Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that [...] "Just when you thought The X-Files couldn't get a more grating guest star than Victoria Jackson, Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, {{for the love of}} God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.'
