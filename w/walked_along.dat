5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> the towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so he did not know how they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E

25|$|A public march, {{organised}} by Melbourne photographer Phillip Werner, {{took place}} on 30 September 2012, {{two days after the}} discovery and recovery of Meagher's body. Approximately 30,000 people <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> Sydney Road in her memory. The march also symbolised broader concerns about violence against women, with ensuing discussion on current issues websites. Afterwards, Edith McKeon, Jill Meagher's mother, publicly thanked the Melbourne community for its support.|$|E

About three hours after the shooting of Pedlow, a bullet fatally struck a 13-year-old Catholic girl, Martha Campbell, as she <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> Springhill Avenue. She was {{among a group of}} young girls and a witness said the firing must have been directed at himself and the girls, as nobody else was in the area at the time.

25|$|The {{country is}} rich and fertile, and the farms {{appear to have}} been {{advantageously}} cultivated, but it now has the marks of a country in ruins, {{a large portion of the}} proprietors having abandoned their homes. On the high road where heretofore was a continuous stream of travelers and vehicles, not a single traveler was seen from week to week, month to month. The countryside was silent. The very tracks of the carriages were grown over with grass or weeds. Travelers <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> bypaths. The villages are abandoned, the residents having fled to the north, leaving their homes, where possible, in charge of elder persons and servants.|$|E
25|$|The {{wreckage}} {{was found}} at 22:50 by a volunteer group, who had <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> the estimated route of the aircraft. Five minutes later crew from Sylling Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps arrived at the site. At this time the operations centrals were alerted of the find and JRCC SN was alerted at 23:07. A helicopter was dispatched from Fornebu at 23:24 and landed at Solli at 23:41 {{to pick up a}} medical doctor. It continued to the crash site, guided by the car lights of the volunteer search crew. It picked up the badly wounded and used two trips to bring them to Solli, where they were sent by ambulance to hospital. Two more wounded were carried to ambulances which had driven to the site. The search and rescue operation was officially concluded at 23:59.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April 1944, {{after four}} days of {{intensive}} drills, PC-1264 went up the Hudson River to Iona Island to load ammunition for her guns for the first time. After loading, Lt. Purdon expected to moor there for the night, but was not allowed due to the danger from {{the large amount of}} ammunition stored there. Looking for a berth for the night, he called the duty office of the nearby U.S. Military Academy at West Point to ask if his ship could tie up at its pier. There was some confusion, as no Navy ship had tied up there in recent history. However, PC-1264, with its mostly African-American crew was made welcome, and numerous visitors <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> the dock inspecting her. In addition, the U.S. Army provided two buses, and many of the enlisted crewmen were taken {{on a tour of the}} Academy under the guidance of knowledgeable sergeants.|$|E

[...] The angel was then pulled back up into the church.

500|$|Of her {{research}} for Falls the Shadow, Penman explains: [...] "I {{did a great}} deal of on-site research, visiting the castles and battlefields that figured in Falls the Shadow, visiting the Reading Room at the British Library, the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, and local reference libraries… Here at home, I made use of the University of Pennsylvania Library in Philadelphia, which has an excellent medieval selection. But it really helped to see the scenes for myself. At Lewes, we actually <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> the same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed. It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs, gazing out upon the same view that he would have seen".|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 1999, Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown, Jr. were {{traveling}} on a Greyhound bus bound for Detroit, Michigan. When the bus made a planned stop in Tallahassee, Florida, passengers {{were told to}} get off the bus so it could be cleaned and refueled. After the passengers re-boarded, the driver allowed Officers Blackburn, Hoover, and Lang of the Tallahassee Police Department to enter the bus [...] "as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction effort". Although the officers displayed visible badges, they carried concealed weapons and were not in uniform. Upon entering the bus, Officer Hoover knelt on the driver's seat, Officer Blackburn stood {{at the back of the}} bus, and Officer Lang <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> the aisle of the bus to talk to passengers. He asked passengers which luggage was theirs and where they were going. None of the officers blocked the aisle or otherwise obstructed the exit, and passengers were free to leave while the officers conducted their investigation. However, the officers did not inform passengers of their right to refuse to cooperate with the investigation.|$|E
