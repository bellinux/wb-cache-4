5|$|By {{tradition}} dated {{back to the}} Byzantine era, {{the king}} was regarded by the Church {{as part of her}} head. On the issue of Church's Autocephaly and his role as king within the Church, Otto <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the arcana of Orthodox Church doctrine and popular discontent with his Roman Catholicism (while the Queen was Protestant).|$|E
5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four guns from the battery.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Taejon (14–21 July 1950) was {{an early}} battle of the Korean War, between American and North Korean forces. Forces of the United States Army {{attempted}} to defend {{the headquarters of the}} 24th Infantry Division. The 24th Infantry Division <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> numerically superior forces of the Korean People's Army (KPA) at the major city and transportation hub of Taejon. The 24th Infantry Division's regiments were already exhausted from the previous two weeks of delaying actions to stem the advance of the KPA.|$|E

5|$|The Gengshi Emperor (r.23–25 AD), a {{descendant}} of Emperor Jing (r.157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu Penzi. Emperor Gengshi's brother Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r.25–57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the JNA {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata, leaving {{the bulk of}} the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the complexity of the situation and could not track which units it had at its disposal—even losing track of units physically near the command post.|$|E
5|$|In late 1993 Shonekan's {{caretaker}} regime <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> {{the military}} coup of General Sani Abacha, who used military force {{on a wide}} scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest. He shifted money to offshore accounts in western European banks and defeated coup plots by bribing army generals. In 1995 the government hanged environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa on trumped-up charges {{in the deaths of}} four Ogoni elders. Lawsuits under the American Alien Tort Statute against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of Shell's Nigerian operation, settled out of court with Shell continuing to deny liability.|$|E

5|$|The four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, {{moved to}} the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw {{identical}} scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, {{the strength of the}} United States team <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|While the Dutch rearguard <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> British numbers, a {{more equal}} combat was being contested to the north. There the combat was centred around the two flagships, Duncan's Venerable {{engaging}} De Winter's Vrijheid 18 minutes after Monarch broke {{the line to}} the south. Duncan had originally intended to break the line between Vrijheid and the next ship Staaten Generaal under Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, but Story ensured {{that there was no}} gap between his vessel and the flagship to break through, and their combined fire was so dangerous to the advancing Venerable that Duncan instead cut through behind Staaten Generaal, raking Story's ship twice and causing it to drift off in confusion as Duncan engaged Vrijheid from the east.|$|E

Mary Jane Watson {{was the only person}} who knew of their liaison and their children's existence prior to Gwen's death and her eventual relationship with Peter, despising Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before through her later romance with Spider-Man discovering he is the villainous Green Goblin.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires and Montevideo {{successfully}} resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by William Carr Beresford seized Buenos Aires {{for a brief}} time; a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers liberated the city. The following year, {{a larger}} army seized Montevideo, but <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the forces of Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned Montevideo to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, {{in spite of the}} prohibition against them. The Patricios Regiment, led by Cornelio Saavedra, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political influence {{that they did not have}} before and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo confidence in their independent capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Royal Artillery {{military}} fortifications {{were established}} at Cley beach, including two 6-inch (15.24cm) guns, five buildings, two pillboxes, a minefield, and concrete anti-tank blocks. A spigot mortar emplacement and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun emplacement were sited {{closer to the}} village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012. The military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold prisoners of war. Near {{the end of the}} war, the camp was used to house East European refugees, and was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1955, but the generator house was taken over by the coastguard service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a look-out, while the larger lower section became a beach café. The building <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> shingle in a storm in 2008, and subsequently demolished.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Belgrade, he began writing poetry {{at an early}} age and {{published}} a number of literary reviews under a pseudonym while he was still a teenager. He rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, writing about his experiences in territories newly retaken from the Ottoman Empire. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Bojić's studies at the University of Belgrade and forced him to postpone marrying his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The couple were separated in the chaos of war, and Bojić left Belgrade with his family and relocated to Niš, where he worked as a military censor and wrote articles for a local newspaper to pay his family's bills. In October 1915, the Serbian Army <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> a combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion and forced to retreat to neutral Greece via Albania. Bojić and his younger brother joined the exodus, marching for several weeks through Kosovo, Montenegro and northern Albania, where they were finally reunited with Bojić's fiancée. Bojić was not allowed to accompany his brother and fiancée on a ship destined for Italy because he was of fighting age, and had to continue marching to Greece without them.|$|E
5|$|American {{involvement}} in the Everglades began during the Second Seminole War (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30million and $40million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged {{with the task of}} finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|On board Arctic, disquiet turned {{increasingly}} into panic as {{it became}} clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate. Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve women and five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew. In the general melee the boat was upended, sending all but three of its occupants into the water, where they drowned. On {{the other side of the}} ship, Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the stern, where women and children passengers would be passed down. No sooner was it launched when it <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> men, who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up women and children, and drifted away. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter boat had been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two {{vacancies}} in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball's desire to accept the calling <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to comfort him. After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the Quorum, and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum's seniority.|$|E
5|$|While Stephen and {{his army}} besieged Lincoln Castle {{at the start}} of 1141, Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf of Chester {{advanced}} on the King's position with a somewhat larger force. When the news reached Stephen, he held a council to decide whether to give battle or to withdraw and gather additional soldiers: Stephen decided to fight, resulting in the battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141. The King commanded the centre of his army, with Alan of Brittany on his right and William of Aumale on his left. Robert and Ranulf's forces had superiority in cavalry and Stephen dismounted many of his own knights to form a solid infantry block; he joined them himself, fighting on foot in the battle. Stephen was not a gifted public speaker, and delegated the pre-battle speech to Baldwin of Clare, who delivered a rousing declaration. After an initial success in which William's forces destroyed the Angevins' Welsh infantry, the battle went badly for Stephen. Robert and Ranulf's cavalry encircled Stephen's centre, and the king found himself surrounded by the enemy army. Many of Stephen's supporters, including Waleran de Beaumont and William of Ypres, fled from the field at this point but Stephen fought on, defending himself first with his sword and then, when that broke, with a borrowed battle axe. Finally, he <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> Robert's men and taken away from the field in custody.|$|E
5|$|With Belldandy and Keiichi now {{portrayed as}} a couple, Fujishima {{introduces}} other factors: specifically the complications caused by family and friends. Forced to leave his dorm, as women {{are not permitted to}} stay on the premises, Keiichi and Belldandy end up living at the Tariki Hongan Temple in the city of Nekomi, Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo. Within both the manga and the anime, the temple was turned over to them by its former guardian, Koshian, a Buddhist monk who <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the purity of Belldandy's spirit and her unparalleled skills in polishing the temple altar, in cooking, and in Zazen meditation. Koshian departs the series by leaving for a pilgrimage to find spiritual perfection, (although he does briefly return later in the series), turning over the temple to Belldandy and Keiichi's care without realizing Belldandy's true nature as a Goddess. Later, Fujishima has Belldandy's two sisters (Urd and Skuld) join Belldandy and Keiichi in the temple. The story then follows the numerous misadventures of the not-so normal household, their growth {{over the course of the}} series and the budding romance between an ordinary young man and an angelic goddess.|$|E
