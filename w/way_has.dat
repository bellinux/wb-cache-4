5|$|Many dwarf galaxies may orbit {{a single}} larger galaxy; the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>has</b> {{at least a}} dozen such satellites, with an {{estimated}} 300–500 yet to be discovered. Dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to large ellipticals, they are often called dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead.|$|E

5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>has</b> never {{collided}} with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of the Milky Way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing.|$|E

5|$|Cacti {{have many}} other uses. They {{are used for}} human food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines. In {{addition}} to their use as psychoactive agents, some cacti are employed in herbal medicine. The practice of using various species of Opuntia in this <b>way</b> <b>has</b> spread from the Americas, where they naturally occur, to other regions where they grow, such as India.|$|E
5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this <b>way</b> <b>has</b> continued since.|$|E
5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. The trail is marked with square black posts with an image, in yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow. This image, copied from the symbol used for waymarking the Ulster <b>Way,</b> <b>has</b> become the traditional waymarking symbol {{for all of the}} National Waymarked Trails in Ireland. Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. The Way is typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E

5|$|The closest analogs {{within the}} Milky Way galaxy {{of the stars}} {{producing}} long gamma-ray bursts are likely the Wolf–Rayet stars, extremely hot and massive stars, which have shed {{most or all of}} their hydrogen to radiation pressure. Eta Carinae and WR 104 have been cited as possible future gamma-ray burst progenitors. It is unclear if any star in the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>has</b> the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma-ray burst.|$|E
5|$|No gamma-ray {{burst from}} {{within our own}} galaxy, the Milky <b>Way,</b> <b>has</b> been observed, and the {{question}} of whether one has ever occurred remains unresolved. In light of evolving understanding of gamma-ray bursts and their progenitors, the scientific literature records a growing number of local, past, and future GRB candidates. Long duration GRBs are related to superluminous supernovae, or hypernovae, and most luminous blue variables (LBVs), and rapidly spinning Wolf–Rayet stars are believed to end their life cycles in core-collapse supernovae with an associated long-duration GRB. Knowledge of GRBs, however, is from metal-poor galaxies of former epochs of the universe's evolution, and it is impossible to directly extrapolate to encompass more evolved galaxies and stellar environments with a higher metallicity, such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The Milky <b>Way</b> <b>has</b> a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E

However, {{since only}} a small fraction of these make up valid destinations, randomly dialing the Stargate is largely futile.
