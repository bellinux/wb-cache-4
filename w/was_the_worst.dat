It later passed just southeast of Réunion before turning {{to the south and}} weakening. The cyclone became extratropical on February14 in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E

We give a randomized strategy based on the “most-recently-used ” heuristic, and show that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> possible online page-replacement strategy. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of Roy, the Avalanche hired Jared Bednar from the Calder Cup champions, the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League, as head coach. On December 10, 2016, the Avalanche allowed 10 goals in a 10–1 loss to the Canadiens. The Avalanche closed out their season {{with a record of}} 22–56–4, resulting in a franchise-low 48 points and a last-place finish in the league; this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record of any team in the NHL since the Atlanta Thrashers finished with a record of 14–61–7 and 39 points in the 1999–2000 season (which was their first season in the league).|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 15th Battalion {{moved to}} Mouquet Farm, where they {{supported}} {{an attack by}} the 14th Battalion and carried out defensive duties. They remained there until early September, when they were withdrawn back to Warloy and then to Reingheist, via Doulens. Before this occurred, on 30 August, the 15th experienced a change in command, as Cannan, who had been promoted to brigadier-general, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Terence McSharry. The remainder {{of the year was}} spent in the Ypres salient, around St Eloi and Boorlartbeek, before winter fell on the Western Front. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> winter in Europe in 40 years, and the men suffered heavily from sickness and the cold as they rotated through the line, conducting defensive duties and labouring before moving to Gueudecourt, and then later Lagnicourt, in the new year.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 1988–89 season, Arsenal led the First Division table; their manager George Graham had {{assembled}} a side mixed with youth and experience, captained by academy graduate Tony Adams. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of defending champions Liverpool, but their lead diminished following a run of bad results. Liverpool, coached by player-manager Kenny Dalglish, capitalised after an indifferent start to the campaign, and emerged as Arsenal's main challengers for the title. Towards {{the end of the}} season Liverpool supporters were involved in a sporting disaster at Hillsborough, where 96 of the club's supporters lost their lives as a result of overcrowding during a match against Nottingham Forest on 15 April. The disaster <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of its kind in English sporting history, and led to an inquiry into safety standards of stadiums.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} days {{there were several}} failed attacks and counter-attacks by both sides. The Turks {{were the first to}} try during the Second attack on Anzac Cove on 27 April, followed by the ANZACs who tried to advance overnight 1/2 May. The Turkish Third attack on Anzac Cove on 19 May <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> defeat of them all, with around ten thousand casualties, including three thousand dead. The next four months consisted of only local or diversionary attacks, until 6 August when the ANZACs, in connection with the Landing at Suvla Bay, attacked Chunuk Bair with only limited success. The Turks never succeeded in driving the Australians and New Zealanders back into the sea. Similarly, the ANZACs never broke out of their beachhead. Instead, in December 1915, after eight months of fighting, they evacuated the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1322, the English {{army was}} routed by the Scots, {{under the command}} of Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire. The English commander, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, was taken prisoner, while the king himself barely escaped capture. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> defeat the English had {{suffered}} in the wars since the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Harclay had received a summons to join the royal army, but {{had not been able to}} bring his troops south in time to come to the king's rescue. The event convinced him that the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king. Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots, without the king's sanction. On 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce at Lochmaben.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1946, the club's {{home was}} the scene of the Burnden Park disaster, which at the time <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> tragedy in British {{football}} history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an FA Cup quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and Stoke City. There was an estimated 67,000-strong crowd crammed in for the game, though other estimates vary widely, with a further 15,000 locked out as it became clear the stadium was full. The disaster led to Moelwyn Hughes's official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes.|$|E
