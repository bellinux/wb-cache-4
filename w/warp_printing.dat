40|$|This work {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the contribution that Ikat weaving and <b>warp</b> <b>printing</b> could make to contemporary textile design. To do this the research first considered the historical background to Ikat weaving and <b>warp</b> <b>printing</b> by examining'the visual and structural characteristics involved and the definitions used historically. Then by studying in some detail the methods of manufacture, dyestuffs, and design imagery of warp Ikats from South America and Central Asia, and weft and double Ikats from Indonesia and Japan a particular was made with a detailed study comparison of these Ikat techniques in The first volume of this work concluded with a detailed study of warp, weft and double Ikats in Japan. From this historic basis {{and analysis of the}} various techniques used experiments were devised to understand more clearly the effect of fibre, structure, colouration, warp design and its positioning on the image produced in the fabric. In investigating this a series of practical experiments was carried out on warp printed wool, cotton and silk fabrics and measurements made {{of the effects of the}} variables. These results were used to undertake a second series of experiments using slub weft yarns, warp printed silk and warp printed cotton fabrics made from a double warp. The work established from an historical viewpoint that the Ikat weavers were familiar and well practised within the traditional design limits of their craft but that these limits were differently defined for the various types of Ikat produced throughout the world. From the technological experiments the factors controlling the image, its size, position. and effect were determined so that ultimately exemplar design effects were created which suggested ways in which this technique could be developed in the future...|$|E

MakerBot uses virgin {{materials such as}} polylactic Acid (PLA) (corn-based), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), and flexible filament. PLA is preferred because it is biodegradable, has a lower melting point, and has higher dimensional stability as compared to ABS; however, PLA is water-soluble and not best for long-term wear (Pei et al. 2015; Samuels and Flowers 2015). Pei et al. (2015) reported significant findings through experimenting with <b>warping,</b> bond, <b>print</b> and flex with their choice of experimental filaments, PLA, ABS and Nylon 465, in both woven and knit fabrics made from natural or synthetic fabrics. They concluded that experimentation is needed to find solutions to challenges in using 3 D printing for fabric applications.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{creating}} {{of pattern}} in woven fabrics by placing design on the warps and/or wefts {{before they are}} woven is ancient. Primary examples of these textiles are ikat, which is a resist dyeing technique, and chine, in which design is painted or in some way printed on the tensioned warp yarns. This study investigated {{the use of the}} screen process method to print the design on tensioned warps in handwoven fabrics. Three experimental warps (cotton, linen, and rayon), were printed and woven. The interaction of the fiber content of the warp, set, weave, and the color of <b>warp,</b> weft, and <b>print</b> were observed. Assessments were made to determine combinations which would achieve a clear and forceful design statement. Results of experiments suggested the importance of selecting yarn for warp which is inelastic, relatively fine and which will allow thorough dye penetration. Best dye penetration was achieved in rayon, and best results were achieved when the warp was threaded and woven in a pattern which exposed a high proportion of the warp yarn. In addition, the printed design was strongest after weaving when both warp and weft threads were a neutral color of light value. Using the screen process method to print design on tensioned warps gave advantages of promoting thorough dye penetration, allowed speed and ease of design replication, and gave the possibility of achieving good precision in edges of design motif...|$|R
40|$|Proto-Meisen The term meisen {{generally}} {{refers to}} plain-weave silk cloth patterned with woven (not printed) stripes or kasuri and made into kimono, haori, and nen 2 ̆ 7 neko (literally 2 ̆ 7 jacket sleeper, 2 ̆ 2 a padded coat worn during the autumn and winter months for carrying babies on the back). In {{the first half}} ofthe twentieth century, almost all Japanese women were familiar with meisen- as ordinary, everyday wear for the upper and middle classes and as dress-up kimono for working- class and country women. In the twenty four years between 1913 and 1937, according to the census, 200 million bolts (tan) of meisen kimono cloth was produced. Meisen originated in the silk and cotton producing centers including Isesaki, Chichibu, Kiryu, Hachioji, and Ashikaga in the Kanto region. The textile makers were very industrious in devising new methods and new effects to capture the market. Around 1907 (Meiji 40), many weaving centers tried to perfect pictorial or print-like ikat (moyo gasuri), which was most effectively executed with <b>printed</b> <b>warp</b> ikat (hogushi gasuri). The tenn hogushi {{is derived from the}} verb hogusu, meaning to unravel or to take apart, and it implies the process where a long warp thread (50 meters or more) is sparsely woven with a temporary weft to keep the warp threads in order during the printing. After steam setting of the dye on the warp and before the warp is woven, the temporary weft has to be taken out on the loom-hence the name hogushi...|$|R
40|$|The {{early twentieth}} century in Japan was both a {{culturally}} and technologically expansive period. The Taishō era (1912 - 1926) spurred {{a new sense of}} freedom and experimentation in many parts of Japanese culture. Fashion was not immune to the invigorating atmosphere that prevailed, and, although Western fabrics and dress were popular, especially in among the affluent in urban areas, innovations in fabric production in Japan itself also brought new and appealing products to the marketplace. Some of these textiles, several of which had been developed earlier in the century and begun to be mass-produced by 1912, were especially well-suited to traditional clothing {{as well as to the}} “adventurous” ideas and tastes of the times. These included muslin, a light, smooth, and finely woven fabric made originally of wool (later, cotton), niko-niko kasuri (“fake” or “playful” kasuri) and meisen, a type of silk (Figs. 1 and 2). Both these latter textiles used <b>warp</b> or warp-and-weft <b>printing</b> techniques to mimic the more labor-intensive and expensive traditionally dyed kasuri textiles. These textiles lent themselves well to the innovative and exciting imagery on textiles that was capturing the essence of Japan as a rapidly modernizing country. The designers of these images intended these textiles to be distinctive and dramatically different from the traditional designs of the past that were, for the most part, based on time-honored seasonal and literary motifs and themes. Rather, these new designs mirrored contemporary popular culture and offer us today a unique visual reference of the social, cultural, and even political interests and icons of the period. The designs, which were used primarily on traditionally printed textiles (muslin was a favorite for this, as it lent itself particularly well to western chemical dyes that were also new to Japan), as well as the newer meisen and niko-niko kasuri, were termed omoshirogara—that is, interesting and/or amusing designs or patterns, and were comparable to what in the West have been called “novelty” or “conversation” prints (Fig. 3) ...|$|R
40|$|My {{work is a}} {{confrontation}} with the conflict between our everyday activities, and the fleetingness of our existence. We are dragged through time and through space, but ultimately we are unavoidably lost in a swirl of oblivion. Given this dissonance, I question the meaning of our everyday activities. Can we find satisfaction with what we do? And why are we compelled to do it? The case I try to make for the meaning of life’s repetitive or renewal actions is made largely in reference to myself, which gives my work an undeniable autobiographical component. For my thesis work, I photograph trivial objects and common scenes from my personal sphere, and print this digital imagery on paper and fabric. Each of these flexible materials allows my print works to expand into the third dimension, through cutting, folding, and sewing. Through such <b>warping</b> the <b>printed</b> object manifests itself in a more accessible way to the viewer in a shared space. The viewer is led to believe they see trivial pointless objects, but they are deceived. What is real and what is imaginary? This is a forlorn universe, with works even bigger than life, doors that cannot be opened or closed, plates too soft to break, and a table too askew. Something unsettling starts to shimmer through. Are the images real at all? I have set into motion a confusion between familiar images that disconnect themselves from the functionality of their tangible counterparts. Things and images of things, reality and imagination whirl around each other. With the leftovers of human presence and absence as art objects, I pose questions about what remains and what is life’s purpose. Such investigations of my ephemerality {{and the purpose of}} my activities are far from easy. They force me to think deeply about my motivations and myself. It is in this confrontational context that my art paraphrases my life. My works and my thoughts merge: the making process and the thinking process are feeding each other, in a symbiotic way. For example, in my piece 2 ̆ 2 Null and Void 2 ̆ 2, there is such an interaction as I seek to visualize a void, to present “what once was but is now lost”. I cut away the tableware from a dining table top and the shapes direct focus to their ambivalence. Their absence causes voids in the table while they emanate absence themselves. On the other hand, the imaged soft sculptures of almost empty, dirty plates, the used silverware, and the leftovers in the pots in 2 ̆ 2 Vanitas 2 ̆ 2 make clear that dinner is over. Uninhabited and futile, the images invoke feelings of desolate loss. I am revealing this dialogue between myself and the pieces as a mutual reinterpretation. This maelstrom of life into art speaks for itself. In its cathartic making I discovered purpose. A purpose that interprets and validates existence, a purpose that elevates the mundane, a purpose that turns daily handwork into meaning. A metamorphosis of unbearable void into fulfilling existence. At this point I encourage the viewer to follow my steps, and I hope my work will guide them through where the useless and the meaningful collide, and where the familiar and the alien tumble...|$|R
