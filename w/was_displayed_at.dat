50|$|Boccioni's {{work was}} in plaster, {{and was never}} cast into bronze in his lifetime. His plaster cast <b>is</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> the Museu de Arte Contemporânea in São Paulo.

5|$|The National Portrait Gallery later refused Harris's {{offer of}} the portrait.

5|$|A {{section of}} the track on land owned by Fisons (who {{extracted}} peat from the area) was donated to the British Museum in London. Although this short section can be assembled for display purposes, it is currently kept in store, off site, and under controlled conditions.

The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 {{as a result of}} budget cuts imposed by Somerset County Council.

5|$|Hitler envisioned {{widespread}} car ownership {{as part of}} the new Germany and {{he arranged}} for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that every German citizen could afford. A prototype <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. No production models were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).|$|E
5|$|Other early {{versions}} of the charters survive today. Only one exemplification of the 1216 charter survives, held in Durham Cathedral. Four copies of the 1217 charter exist; three of these are held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford and one by Hereford Cathedral. Hereford's copy is occasionally displayed alongside the Mappa Mundi in the cathedral's chained library and has survived along with a small document called the Articuli super Cartas that was sent along with the charter, telling the sheriff of the county how to observe the conditions outlined in the document. One of the Bodleian's copies <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> San Francisco's California Palace of the Legion of Honor in 2011.|$|E

Selfe's cousin Edward Muggeridge grew up in the same town but moved to the United States in 1855, restyled himself Eadweard Muybridge, and achieved global fame as a pioneer in the new field of photography.|$|E
5|$|The Command Module Columbia <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C.

5|$|The Grolier Codex (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Sáenz Codex) is a Maya book of a pre-Columbian type but of disputed authenticity. It first appeared in a private collection in the 20th century and <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name. The codex consists of a fragment of a Maya book, containing almanacs of Venus represented in a simplistic fashion. The Grolier Codex would be only the fourth surviving pre-Columbian Maya book if genuine. The codex {{is said to have been}} recovered from a cave in the Mexican state of Chiapas in the 1960s, together with a mosaic mask and some blank pages of pre-Columbian fig-bark paper. It <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> the Grolier Club from April 20 to June 5, 1971, and is now held in Mexico City. In 1973, Michael D. Coe published the first half-size recto-side facsimile of the codex in The Maya Scribe and His World, produced by the Grolier Club. The codex contains a Venus almanac that, in structure, is closely related to the Venus almanac contained in the Dresden Codex.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Sacred Spain: Art and Belief in the Spanish World brought {{together}} 71 {{works of art}} {{from a wide variety}} of lenders, including Peru, Mexico, and the Prado in Spain. The exhibit was composed of a rare collection of pieces, many of which had never been on view in the United States. It featured paintings, sculpture, metalwork, and books by artists such as El Greco, Diego Velázquez, and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Andy Warhol Enterprises <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> the IMA from October, 2010 to January, 2011 and featured more than 150 works of art by Andy Warhol, as well as archival materials. The exhibition was the largest to illustrate Warhol's fascination with money and feature consumerism as a central theme. Visitors were able to view the progression of Warhol's career, from his beginnings as a commercial artist to his multimillion-dollar empire.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{one of the}} {{aircraft}} <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> Farnborough Airshow, and Norsk Forurensningskontroll stated that they hoped to sell the technology abroad. The idea of having an oil spill services of this type was eventually abandoned by the authorities and by the oil industry, and instead NFK started using their aircraft for various charter purposes, such as bird counting for universities and parachuting. In 1986, the company gained {{a contract with the}} French government for supplying a French–Canadian semi-military female expedition, aiming to traverse the polar basin from the northernmost tip of Svalbard to the North Pole on skis. The aircraft was based in Svalbard, {{and a number of other}} scientific and exploration expeditions were supported, including electronic mapping of the headrock underneath glaciers, under a contract for the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University, financed by British Petroleum.|$|E
5|$|The loyalist force {{marched to}} the Hippodrome, where they drove away most of John's supporters. They then entered the palace, where they found scarce {{opposition}} from John's attendants. John was captured after a short chase in the palace and his head was immediately cut off, to be displayed {{the next morning at}} the Forum of Constantine, while his body <b>was</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>at</b> Blachernae. A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night, while others were captured and tortured to extract the names of all the conspirators. Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in this affair (he is known to have been in prison in 1203), and the two Komnenos brothers, Alexios and David, seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup's failure.|$|E
