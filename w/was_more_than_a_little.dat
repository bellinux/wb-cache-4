Slezak called it [...] "totally joyous fun" [...] and Chaney {{said it was}} [...] "the most effortlessly joyful moment of the night"; the two handed out [...] "A−" [...] and [...] "A" [...] grades respectively. Futterman felt it was performed [...] "with silly spirit", and was [...] "another throwback to simpler and successful Glee moments". Hankinson {{thought it was the}} best musical number of the night, even if [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> reminiscent of their performance of 'Dog Days Are Over, but Kubicek thought the earlier song was [...] "a million times better".

2500|$|Grierson {{returned}} to Great Britain in 1927 {{armed with the}} sense that film could be enlisted {{to deal with the}} problems of the Great Depression, and to build national morale and national consensus. [...] Filmmaking for Grierson was an exalted calling; the Filmmaker a patriot. In all of this there <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> elitism, a stance reflected in Grierson's many dicta of the time: [...] "The elect have their duty." [...] "I look on cinema as a pulpit, {{and use it as a}} propagandist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles Jenkins {{wrote in}} his book The Reluctant Communist that Abshier had {{difficulty}} conversing in Korean but was fascinated by words and would spend hours studying high-level vocabulary from newspapers. Jenkins reported that the four were moved into a one-room house in Mangyongdae-guyok in June 1965, where they lived together {{for several years and}} were forced to read and memorize passages by Kim Il Sung. Jenkins asserted that Dresnok would bully Abshier at this time, for example, by making a mess and then demanding that Abshier clean it up. Abshier was sympathetically characterized by Jenkins as [...] "a simple, sweet, good-hearted soul who <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dumb and easy to take advantage of." ...|$|E

There <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> symbolism in Dr. Washington riding as a VIP in the personal railcar of the late Henry Rogers, who was held high in the esteem of the local citizenry for the well-known {{fact that he had}} financed the new railroad through their communities from his personal fortune. At the many stops, Dr. Washington told his audiences that his recently departed friend had urged him to make the trip and see what could be done to improve relations between the races and economic conditions for African Americans along the route of the new railway, which touched many previously isolated communities in the southern portions of Virginia and West Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the start}} of 1998, the FIA decreed that all Formula One grids must be straight: in order to comply with this, the RAC moved the start line forward at Silverstone but not, significantly, the finish line. This led to some {{confusion}} {{at the end of}} the Grand Prix, which was scheduled for 60 laps, but was effectively 59.95 laps: it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fortunate that the timing was being taken from the finish line and not the start line as the winning car was in the pits {{at the end of the}} race and the Ferrari pit was situated between the two lines.

2500|$|The band {{dedicated}} {{two days}} to rehearsals. The rehearsal sessions were tense and difficult, with the band running into problems performing various songs. During the sessions, Cobain disagreed with MTV {{as to how the}} performance should be presented. Producer Alex Coletti recollected that the network was unhappy with the band's choice of the Meat Puppets as guests ("They wanted to hear the 'right' names - Eddie Vedder or Tori Amos or God knows who," [...] Coletti recalled) and the dearth of hit Nirvana songs on the setlist. Upset, the day before filming was set to take place, Cobain refused to play. However, he appeared at the studio the following afternoon. Cobain was suffering from drug withdrawal and nervousness at the time; one observer said, [...] "There was no joking, no smiles, no fun coming from him... Therefore, everyone <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> worried about his performance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because {{so much of}} {{the story}} is set in the winter, it was crucial to film the series where it was likely snow would be available. Due to budget constraints, Russia, Norway, and Finland were deemed too expensive. Alberta, Canada was {{considered}} until the producers learned the previous year's snowfall had been minimal. Other Canadian provinces were rejected because the production crew was told it would be too cold to operate the needed equipment. Slovakia, where a 95% chance of snow was predicted, was selected for the March filming, and there was a blizzard two days before shooting began. But it quickly melted, and eventually the scenic designers had to utilize 1000 bags of artificial snow. Producer Hugh Warren recalled, [...] "We had all the expense of going to Slovakia as well as the trouble of crossing the border, and then there was no snow. It <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> ironic." ...|$|E

[...] The writer {{went on to say}} that the accident would have [...] "far-reaching consequences for everybody" [...] and tried to work out who was to blame, before adding [...] "Whoever's fault it is, we can't wait to see what happens next!" [...] A reporter for the TVTimes stated [...] "With more road accidents in this patch of Oz than anywhere else in the world, Sophie is asking for trouble when she piles into Chris's car, which is already overloaded with teenagers thanks to Andrew egging him on." [...] Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, thought the police did [...] "a half-baked investigation into the car crash", enabling Paul to sue Chris. The storyline was included in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2013 as one of [...] "The best bits of September". It was also named [...] "Crash of the month". The crash was nominated for Best Storyline in Digital Spy's end of year reader poll for 2012, it received 5.5% of the vote.|$|E
