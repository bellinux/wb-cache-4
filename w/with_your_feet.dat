2500|$|The {{degree of}} {{commercialisation}} of Mount Everest {{is a frequent}} subject of criticism. Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, [...] "You still have to climb this mountain yourself <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet.</b> But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who {{have no idea how}} to put on crampons. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others." ...|$|E
2500|$|A proper stance starts <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> being aligned at the target, {{followed}} by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards {{the target and}} your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. [...] As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. [...] Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club. [...] Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. [...] The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing. [...] Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.|$|E
2500|$|ERICKSON: You know, I had {{one patient}} this last July who had {{four or five}} years of {{psychoanalysis}} and got nowhere with it. And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E
50|$|Fall Off the Log: Kick {{right leg}} to the side, then step behind <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot,</b> out <b>with</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot,</b> and in place <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot.</b> Repeat {{this on the}} left side.|$|R
50|$|The step is done two {{different}} ways. One is more elaborate than the other. Initially, while standing with feet side by side, {{step to the}} side <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot</b> followed by stepping further <b>with</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot</b> so that you are standing <b>with</b> <b>your</b> legs crossed. Then step right again <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot</b> so that you are standing normally <b>with</b> <b>your</b> legs slightly apart.|$|R

2500|$|The three spirit souls {{are located}} beneath the liver. They look like {{human beings and}} wear green robes with yellow inner garments. Every month on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third, they leave the body at night to go {{wandering}} about. At this time, lie down <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> up, your head supported by a pillow, and your legs stretched out straight. Fold your hands over your heart, close your eyes, and hold your breath. Clap your teeth three times. Now visualize a red energy in your heart {{about the size of}} an egg. It emerges from the heart and rises into the throat, from where it spreads a wondrous radiance that envelopes your entire body to grow into a glowing fire all around it. You should feel the body getting quite warm. At that point, call out their names: [...] "Spirit Guidance—come to succor me! Inner Radiance—come to nurture me! Dark Essence—come to protect my life! Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!" [...] (1, 7, tr. Kohn 2009: 168) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And me, in a way. But if {{you were}} walking about in a very tight pair of boots, in an agony <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> would you be able just then to relish the news that {{agricultural}} wages in that parish had gone up sixpence a week?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful, Nelly," [...] {{he exclaimed}} {{when he joined}} her, [...] "not to tread on a stick or disturb a fallen leaf <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> and above all to avoid {{breaking}} the smallest twig as you pass. Choose the most open ground, as that is the hardest." ...|$|E
5000|$|A switch is {{a stance}} that is {{opposite}} to one's natural stance. For example, riding <b>with</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot</b> forwards {{as opposed to}} normally riding <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot</b> forwards. A [...] "regular" [...] skater's switch stance is [...] "goofy", and vice versa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Life's a funny thing! You wake in {{the morning}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> firm on the ladder--One touch, and down you go! You snuff out like a candle. And it's lucky when your flame goes out, if only one woman's flame goes out too.|$|R
6000|$|She {{passed the}} {{question}} over without notice. [...] "I {{wish you would}} help me to get at it," [...] she persisted. [...] "Suppose you could rid my mistress of that man by giving him a kick, would you up <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> and do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|You'll bury me, [2] my mother, {{just beneath}} the {{hawthorn}} shade, [...] And you'll come [3] sometimes and see me where I am lowly laid.

6000|$|The {{patience}} of the Patrician {{was at an}} end. [...] "Speak this instant, you rascal!" [...] he shouted angrily. [...] "Another minute, and I will have you dragged to the ergastulum, where, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> in the stocks and the gyves round your wrists, you may learn quicker obedience. Speak, I say, and without delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, sir," [...] he said, [...] "what's this? Tired today? Not feeling well? You aren't boxing like yourself, {{not at all}} you aren't. There's no weight behind 'em. You're tapping. What's {{the matter}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> too? You aren't getting about as quickly as I should like to see. What {{have you been doing}} to yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let that snake sleep. Do not kick it <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot.</b> Suffice it you to {{know that}} my head hangs upon this matter; that I am a rat in a forked stick, and if the stick is pressed on by a heavy hand, then where is the rat?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The SSC Ultimate Aero was {{not sold}} with {{electronic}} driver aids such as antilock brakes or traction control, as according to Jerod Shelby, [...] "Early design philosophy {{on the car}} was {{to make it a}} driver's car.

50|$|The business's website {{states it}} {{produced}} the first foot gong {{used in an}} automobile (the bell was patented in 1897). The foot gong is a bell that was beneath the floor of early automobiles and was rung by pressing it <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot.</b> It has since {{been replaced by the}} car horn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys {{always say}} so," [...] said Mrs. Frederick Langford; [...] "it is a--what shall I call it?--a puerile delusion, which their mammas can always defeat when they choose by a {{formidable}} list of colds and coughs; but I won't {{put you in}} mind of how often you have sat <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> on the fender croaking like an old raven, and solacing yourself with stick-liquorice and Ivanhoe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will show}} thee how I {{will come out}} of it if ever I go to lie in such a fire--ay, though it be ten times as big and fierce. Ho! my children!"

Run swiftly and stamp it flat <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet.</b> Where there was fire let there be blackness and ashes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Arthur drank a large bumper of sherry. [...] "I {{have heard}} the most {{extraordinary}} news; I will tell you afterwards," [...] he said, looking at the servants. He was very nervous and agitated during the dinner. [...] "Don't tramp and beat so <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> under the table," [...] Lady Rockminster said. [...] "You have trodden on Fido, and upset his saucer. You see Mr. Warrington keeps his boots quiet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knew his risks!" [...] she repeated. [...] "You {{mean that}} because you were on <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> {{when he was on}} the ground, you would make use of him like any other lump of mud you would spurn <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> if you had not found a use for it. He did your bidding, poor fool, but where he failed, I succeeded. You have to deal with me now, and I think that it is my turn to make terms!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You made eyes at me, looking {{soft and}} kind, playing {{up all the}} time the fact that you wore skirts instead of pants--and all the time <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> on the bell under the table. Well, there's some consolation. I'd sooner be poor Hughie Luke, doing his ten years, than be in your skin. Ma'am, hell is full of women like you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Samba Point: Step across <b>with</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot</b> and tap <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right. Stretch {{your left}} arm skyward. Repeat the step on your {{opposite}} leg.|$|R
6000|$|It did {{not matter}} what the play {{was to have been}} after that; it all turned upon the accident. Juno came on, and began to reproach Jupiter for his carelessness. [...] "I've sent Mercury upstairs for the aynica; but he says it's no use: that boy won't be able to pass ball for a week. How often have I told you not to sit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> out that way! I knew you'd hurt somebody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it makes}} no difference," [...] Godfrey urged. [...] "We are not due at Pekin on any given day. It is very {{pleasant}} out here, where one can enjoy one's freedom and exult {{that there is no}} policeman or Cossack watching every movement. It would make no difference to me if we stopped here for a month. Now let me pull those boots off for you, then you can sit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> in this little pool." ...|$|E
60|$|Sitting <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> {{drawn up}} in front of you, on a small and rickety one-legged table, is a most trying exercise, {{especially}} if you are not used to it. George and I both felt our position keenly. We did not like to call out for help, and bring the family down. We were proud young men, and we feared lest, to the unsympathetic eye of the comparative stranger, the spectacle we should present might not prove imposing.|$|E
5000|$|QLF - [...] "Are you sending <b>with</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot?</b> Try sending <b>with</b> <b>your</b> left foot!" [...] A humorously {{derogatory}} {{comment about}} the quality of a person's sending.|$|R
5000|$|Samba Point: Step across <b>with</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot</b> and tap <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right. Stretch {{your left}} arm skyward. Just think Saturday Night Fever. Repeat the step on your {{opposite}} leg.|$|R
6000|$|Gom. Ay, you {{are always}} at hand to do me a courtesy, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> eagle's <b>feet,</b> and <b>your</b> tiger's wings.--And what were you here for, friar? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ned, I do {{wish you}} would not fidget <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet.</b> You know your dear father often told you of it;" [...] or, [...] "As your dear father used to say, Ned;" [...] until the boy in despair would throw down his book and rush {{out of the room}} to calm himself by a run in the frosty night air; while Mrs. Sankey would murmur to herself, [...] "That boy's temper gets worse and worse, and with my poor nerves how am I to control him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Oenone {{answered}} scornfully: 'Why {{have you}} come here to me? Surely for years you have not come this way, where the path was once worn <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet.</b> But long ago you left me lonely and lamenting, {{for the love of}} Helen of the fair hands. Surely she is much more beautiful than the love of your youth, and far more able to help you, for men say that she can never know old age and death. Go home to Helen and let her take away your pain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} that, as you can't do much with those hands of yours, digging and shoveling, {{and not much}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> either, over ploughed ground, you might do some inside work, that would pay you better, too. You might help in the dining room, setting table and washing up, helping ma and me--though I don't do much except overseeing. I could show {{you what to do}} at first, and you'd learn quick enough. If you say 'yes,' I'll speak to pa to-night. He'll do whatever I say." ...|$|E

60|$|Into this humble abode I {{would take}} any one who cares to {{accompany}} me. But {{you must not}} come in a contemptuous mood, thinking that the poor are but a stage removed from beasts of burden, as some cruel writers of these days say; nor will I have you turn over <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> the shabby horse-hair chairs that Leeby kept so speckless, and Hendry weaved for years to buy, and Jess so loved to look upon.|$|R
