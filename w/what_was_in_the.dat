5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
5|$|The area {{is known}} to have been {{occupied}} since the Neolithic when people exploited the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks. The Sweet Track, named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BC, is the world's oldest timber trackway, once thought to be the world's oldest engineered roadway. The track was built between <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 4thmillennium BC an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, close to the River Brue. The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the peat bog including the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay and Nidons trackways.|$|E

The archaeology, history and geology of the Somerset Levels was displayed at the Peat Moors Centre until its closure in 2009. The centre also included reconstructions of some of the archaeological discoveries, including a number of Iron Age round houses from Glastonbury Lake Village, and the Sweet Track.|$|E

25|$|Benambra Primary School {{opened on}} 3 October 1876, {{initially}} {{under the name}} ‘Omeo Plains East’.

25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake – after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed. Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest he knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time.

25|$|In 1877, the English {{language}} {{rough draft}} of the Treaty was published along with photolithographic facsimiles, and the originals were returned to storage. In 1911, historian and bibliographer Dr Thomas Hocken, searching for historical documents, found the Treaty papers in poor condition, damaged at the edges by water and partly eaten by rodents. The papers were restored by the Dominion Museum in 1913 and kept in special boxes from then on. In February 1940, the Treaty documents were taken to Waitangi for display in the Treaty House during the Centenary celebrations. It was possibly {{the first time the}} Treaty document had been on public display since it was signed. After the outbreak of war with Japan, they were placed with other state documents in an outsize luggage trunk and deposited for secure custody with the Public Trustee at Palmerston North by the local MP, who did not tell staff <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case.

500|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of ICWA in 1978, Indian children were often forcibly removed from their homes and placed in either Native American boarding schools or in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes. [...] Studies conducted in 1969 and in 1974 indicated that as many as 25 to 35 percent of tribal children were being removed from their homes, and consequently from tribal culture. [...] Testimony in the House Committee for Interior and Insular Affairs showed that in some states, the per capita rate of Indian children in foster care was nearly 16 times higher than the rate for non-Indians. [...] In some cases, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) paid the states to remove tribal children and to place them with non-Indian families and religious groups. Congress determined that if Indian children continued to be removed from Indian homes at this rate, tribal survival would be threatened and stated that tribal stability was as important as {{the best interests of the}} child. One of the factors in this judgment was that, because of the differences in culture, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best interest of a non-Indian child was not necessarily <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best interest of an Indian child, especially due to the influence of extended families and tribal relationships.|$|E

500|$|One {{theory as}} to how Göring {{obtained}} the poison holds that U.S. Army Lieutenant Jack G.

In 2005, former U.S. Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers, who served in the 1st Infantry Division's 26th Infantry Regimentthe honour guard for the Nuremberg Trialsclaimed he gave Göring [...] "medicine" [...] hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison.

[...] Apart from this quoted sentence, there is no indication of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boxes. The last of the crash's two survivors died in April 1980, and Bormann had died after leaving the Berlin bunker following Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945.

500|$|James granted Atholl the {{positions}} of Sheriff of Perth and Justicier and also the earldom of Strathearn but this, significantly, in life-rent only—acts that confirmed Earl Walter's policing remit given by Albany and his already effective grip on Strathearn. Atholl's elder son, David {{had been one of}} the hostages sent to England as a condition of James's release and had died there in 1434—his younger son, Alan died in the king's service at the Battle of Inverlochy in 1431. David's son Robert was now Atholl's heir and both were now in line to the throne after the young Prince James. James continued to show favour to Atholl and appointed his grandson Robert as his personal chamberlain but by 1437, after a series of setbacks at the hands of James, the earl and Robert probably viewed the king's actions as a prelude to further acquisitions at Atholl's expense. [...] Atholl's hold on the rich earldom of Strathearn was weak and both he and Robert would have realised that after the earl's death Strathearn would have reverted to the crown. [...] This meant that Robert's holdings would have been the relatively impoverished earldoms of Caithness and Atholl and amounted to no more than <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earl Walter's possession in the years between 1406 and 1416.|$|E
500|$|A Palaeolithic flint tool {{found in}} Westbury is the {{earliest}} indication of human {{presence in the}} area, dating from approximately 500,000 years ago. Later during the 7thmillennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys, forcing the Mesolithic people to occupy seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. Subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man's using the Levels only in the summer, hence the county of Somerset may derive its name from Sumorsaete, meaning land of the summer people. An alternative suggestion is that the name derives from Seo-mere-saetan meaning [...] "settlers by the sea lakes". The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks. The Sweet Track, named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BC, is the world's oldest timber trackway, {{once thought to be}} the world's oldest engineered roadway.
