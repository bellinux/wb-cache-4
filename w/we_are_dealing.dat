Since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant.

25|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} a few selected values for t-distributions with ν {{degrees of freedom}} {{for a range of}} one-sided or two-sided critical regions. For an example of how to read this table, take the fourth row, which begins with 4; that means ν, the number of degrees of freedom, is 4 (and if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing,</b> as above, with n values with a fixed sum, n = 5). Take the fifth entry, in the column headed 95% for one-sided (90% for two-sided). The value of that entry is 2.132. Then the probability that T is less than 2.132 is 95% or Pr(−∞ < T < 2.132) = 0.95; this also means that Pr(−2.132 < T < 2.132) = 0.9.|$|E

500|$|In particular, Fodor {{criticizes the}} instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett. Dennett {{maintains}} {{that it is}} possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations. Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining why the intentional strategy works:There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires works so well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false.... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> with the only theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.|$|E

30|$|The {{participants}} {{performed the}} Simon task (Bialystok et al. 2004), and the ANT task (Fan et al. 2002). In both, “RT” {{and level of}} “Accuracy” were taken as dependent variables, and “Language Group” (monolingual/bilingual) was taken as an independent variable. In order to choose the appropriate statistical tests, we contrasted the normality hypothesis for all the pairs of samples with the Shapiro–Wilk and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Since <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> with independent factors, we also used the Levene test to see the homogeneity of variance. Results indicated {{that some of our}} variables did not show normality or homogeneity and so were measured by non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney, while others could be measured by Independent Samples t-tests. Because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> with second language research, we used a p-value below 0.05 as a cut-off point for all the statistical tests.|$|R
500|$|The {{reason for}} this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for {{classical}} disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate. This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (spin angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., x and y) results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state ɸ of a certain electron verifies the proposition [...] "the spin of the electron in the x direction is positive." [...] By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction y will be completely indeterminate for ɸ. Hence, ɸ can verify neither the proposition [...] "the spin in the direction of y is positive" [...] nor ...|$|E
500|$|On 16 August 2010, Iranian {{officials}} withdrew Mohammed Soleimani {{from the}} men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico {{earlier in the}} year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to have missed the bout as he was [...] "sure [...] {{was going to get}} the gold medal". Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: [...] "It's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew {{that this is going to}} happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed that he did not have a chance to win his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained hard to get to this stage and was not given a chance to fight. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved." [...] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: [...] "As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is all right now. So unless more factual information is available, it [...] is mere speculation." [...] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: [...] "He [...] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story." [...] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1908, {{with her}} Viața Românească articles, Sadoveanu turned her {{attention}} to the impact of Symbolism and the anti-traditionalist Romanian Symbolist branch. As she herself argued decades later: [...] "I was the only one to express the opinion that [...] <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> with an innovative movement, just like I was the first one in history to sketch out Symbolism in articles for Viața Românească". According to various commentators of her work, cited by literary historian Paul Cernat, she was indeed the first Romanian to take an interest in the movement, and who therefore opened a channel of communication between the Poporanists and the Romanian Symbolists. This assessment is partly contradicted by researcher Angelo Mitchievici, who reviews earlier such essays written by Alexandru Bibescu and Elena Bacaloglu.|$|E
