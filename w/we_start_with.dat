25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> {{a limited amount of}} information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, a {{group of}} {{particles}} known as fermions (for example, electrons, protons and neutrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This states that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. Since an idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle stationary states, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy. To find the ground state of the whole system, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> an empty system, and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles have been put in, the Fermi energy is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state.|$|E

500|$|Nimoy visited Meyer's {{house and}} suggested, [...] " [...] the wall comes down in outer space? You know, the Klingons {{have always been}} our stand-ins for the Russians..." [...] Meyer {{recalled}} that he replied [...] "'Oh, wait a minute! Okay, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> an intergalactic Chernobyl! Big explosion! We got no more Klingon Empire...!' And I just spilled out the whole story!" [...] The story deliberately included references to the contemporary political climate; the character of Gorkon was based on Mikhail Gorbachev, while the assassination storyline was Meyer's idea. He thought it was plausible that the Klingon leader who turned soft towards the enemy would be killed like similar peacemakers throughout history: Anwar El Sadat, Gandhi, and Abraham Lincoln. Nimoy's hiring of Meyer was not only beneficial because Meyer knew the material and could write fast (having produced The Wrath of Khans screenplay in twelve days), but if Meyer was to direct it would offset any acrimony from Shatner, whose ire would have been aroused if Nimoy returned to direct his third Star Trek feature after [...] and The Voyage Home. Meyer {{said that when he}} started work on the screenplay it did not occur to him that he would direct the film. Meyer's wife {{was the first person to}} suggest that he should direct.|$|E
500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> {{the assumption of}} three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the}} game say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E
500|$|Suppose <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> one {{electron}} at {{a certain}} place and time (this place and time being given the arbitrary label A) and a photon at another place and time (given the label B). A typical question from a physical standpoint is: 'What is the probability of finding an electron at C (another place and a later time) and a photon at D (yet another place and time)?'. The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from A to C (an elementary action) and for the photon to move from B to D (another elementary action). From {{a knowledge of the}} probability amplitudes of each of these sub-processes – E(A to C) and P(B to D) – then we would expect to calculate the probability amplitude of both happening together by multiplying them, using rule b) above. This gives a simple estimated overall probability amplitude, which is squared to give an estimated probability. [...] But there are other ways in which the end result could come about. The electron might move to a place and time E where it absorbs the photon; then move on before emitting another photon at F; then move on to C where it is detected, [...] while the new photon moves on to D. The probability of this complex process can again be calculated by knowing the probability amplitudes of each of the individual actions: three electron actions, two photon actions and two vertexes – one emission and one absorption. We would expect to find the total probability amplitude by multiplying the probability amplitudes of each of the actions, for any chosen positions of E and F. We then, using rule a) above, have to add up all these probability amplitudes for all the alternatives for E and F. (This is not elementary in practice, and involves integration.) But there is another possibility, which is that the electron first moves to G where it emits a photon which goes on to D, while the electron moves on to H, where it absorbs the first photon, before moving on to C. Again we can calculate the probability amplitude of these possibilities (for all points G and H). We then have a better estimation for the total probability amplitude by adding the probability amplitudes of these two possibilities to our original simple estimate. Incidentally the name given to this process of a photon interacting with an electron in this way is Compton scattering.|$|E
