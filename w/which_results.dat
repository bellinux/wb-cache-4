40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the potential utility of Landsat- 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for change detection analysis and mapping application {{because of its}} superior technical design to previous Landsat series. The OLI SVM classified data was successfully classified with regard to all six test classes (i. e., bare land, built-up land, mixed trees, bushes, dam water and channel water). OLI support vector machine (SVM) classified data for the four seasons (i. e., spring, autumn, winter, and summer) was used to change detection results of six cases: (1) winter to spring <b>which</b> <b>resulted</b> reduction in dam water mapping and increases of bushes; (2) winter to summer <b>which</b> <b>resulted</b> reduction in dam water mapping and increase of vegetation; (3) winter to autumn <b>which</b> <b>resulted</b> increase in dam water mapping; (4) spring to summer <b>which</b> <b>resulted</b> reduction of vegetation and shallow water; (5) spring to autumn <b>which</b> <b>resulted</b> decrease of vegetation; and (6) summer to autumn <b>which</b> <b>resulted</b> increase of bushes and vegetation. OLI SVM classified data resulted higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient and thus found suitable for change detection analysis...|$|R

5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way.

5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, <b>which</b> <b>results</b> in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, <b>which</b> <b>results</b> in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
