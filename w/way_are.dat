5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>are</b> likely single from birth.|$|E

In Manistique, M-94 enters town on North 5th St before turning to follow Deer Street and River Street. On River Street, the trunkline uses the Siphon Bridge to cross the Manistique River and then uses Elk and Maple streets before terminating at US 2 at Lakeshore Drive.|$|E
5|$|Space Race is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released on July 16, 1973. It {{was the second}} game by the company after Pong (1972), which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry. In the game, two players each control a rocket ship, with the goal of being the first to move their ship from the bottom of the screen to the top. Along the <b>way</b> <b>are</b> asteroids, which the players must avoid. Space Race was the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles.|$|E

Planetary-mass objects formed this <b>way</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs.

5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky <b>Way,</b> <b>are</b> in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E

The second <b>way</b> <b>is</b> through an examination on the ideal government of the Byzantine Empire, and Byzantine critiques of the Italian City States, {{in comparison to the}} ideal, from the Upper Middle Ages, to the Renaissance. The third <b>way</b> <b>is</b> through the rise of trade contracts in Venice. The fourth <b>way</b> <b>is</b> the implicit nature of the priority of the trade business in patrician life.

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this <b>way</b> <b>are</b> only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Gas Powered Games {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios on April 5, 2002, for Microsoft Windows, and the following year for MacOS. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young farmer and his companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn {{the nearby town of}} the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the companions that join him along the <b>way</b> <b>are</b> soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video games of the time, the world of Dungeon Siege does not have levels but is a single, continuous area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world, {{the majority of}} the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this <b>way</b> <b>are</b> known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time. A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.|$|E

5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which they fly {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top. Along the <b>way</b> <b>are</b> dashes {{representing}} asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by a line in the bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes.|$|E
5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, and along the <b>way</b> <b>are</b> attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes {{that he is the}} leader of the drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E
