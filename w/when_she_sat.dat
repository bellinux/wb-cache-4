Bono's national profile increased significantly in 1998 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on the House Judiciary panel to consider impeachment articles against Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Edwards {{began his}} own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He {{became known as}} the top plaintiffs' {{attorney}} in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{unhappiness}} in Lawrence's life was his romantic entanglement {{with two of}} Sarah Siddons' daughters. He fell in love first with Sally, then transferred his affections on to her sister Maria, then broke with Maria and turned to Sally again. Both the sisters had fragile health; Maria died in 1798, on her deathbed extracting a promise from her sister never to marry Lawrence. Sally kept her promise and refused to see Lawrence again, dying in 1803. But Lawrence continued on friendly terms with their mother and painted several portraits of her. He never married. In later years two women would provide him with companionship, friends Elizabeth Croft and Isabella Wolff who first met Lawrence <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> for her portrait in 1803. Isabella was married to the Danish consul Jens Wolff, but she separated from him in 1810, and Sir Michael Levey suggests that people may have wondered if Lawrence {{was the father of}} her son Herman.|$|E

60|$|But after breakfast--that is, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> {{for a while}} {{over her}} teacup--she {{returned}} to the room, and this time she entered it.

500|$|Hitler {{wished to}} present {{himself in the}} image of a chaste hero; in the Nazi ideology, men were the {{political}} leaders and warriors, and women were homemakers. He believed that he was sexually attractive to women and wished to exploit this for political gain by remaining single, as he felt marriage would decrease his appeal. He and Braun never appeared as a couple in public; the only time they appeared together in a published news photo was <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> near him at the 1936 Winter Olympics. The German people were unaware of Braun's relationship with Hitler until after the war. According to Speer's memoirs, Braun never slept in the same room as Hitler and had her own rooms at the Berghof, in Hitler's Berlin residence, and in the Berlin bunker. Speer later said, [...] "Eva Braun will prove a great disappointment to historians." ...|$|E
500|$|Albert Aurier praised {{his work}} in the Mercure de France in January 1890, and {{described}} him as [...] "a genius". In February Van Gogh painted five versions of L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux), based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> for both artists in November 1888. Also in February, Van Gogh was invited by Les XX, a society of avant-garde painters in Brussels, to participate in their annual exhibition. At the opening dinner a Les XX member, Henry de Groux, insulted Van Gogh's work. Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group. Later, while Van Gogh's exhibit was on display with the Artistes Indépendants in Paris, Claude Monet said that his work was the best in the show. After the birth of his nephew, Van Gogh wrote, [...] "I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{became the}} first African American to play Uncle Tom in a serious production. Nevertheless, the show fared poorly in Richmond, Virginia, and not even a change of venue to Lucas's home state of Ohio could save the production. The {{problems}} {{seem to have been}} many. One critic remarked that [...] "little" [...] Eva was so large that she nearly flattened St. Clair <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in his lap. Lucas had to hawk his stash of diamonds to pay the troupe's transport back to Cincinnati.|$|E

6000|$|<b>When</b> there <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> {{for a while}} {{over the}} fire, and then drew out her desk. She had been beaten,--absolutely beaten,--and it was {{necessary}} that she should own so much in writing to one person. So she wrote her letter, which was as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> upright <b>she</b> breathed plaintively and said, [...] "I do feel rather weak still. I thought I was well; and I {{ought not}} to be here, ought I?"

6000|$|THREE {{months later}} the war seemed drawing toward an end, and Christie was dreaming happy dreams of home and rest with David, <b>when,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> one day writing a letter full of good news to {{the wife of a}} patient, a {{telegram}} was handed to her, and tearing it open she read: ...|$|R

60|$|The Baroness {{had dropped}} her lorgnettes on the floor. She stooped {{instantly}} to discover them, rejecting almost peremptorily Wrayson's aid. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> up again {{she pushed her}} chair a little further back.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down at {{the pretty}} round table, {{arranged}} for two persons, Miss Panney {{was surprised at the}} scanty supply of eatables. There was the tea-tray, bread and butter, and some radishes. Her soul rose in anger.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> {{down to a}} basketful {{of their}} stockings, every heel {{with a hole in}} it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, 'Oh dear, I am sure I {{sometimes}} think spinsters are to be envied.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> down he came {{round the}} table and moved towards her. When he drew quite near, she instinctively recoiled.

60|$|It {{was fixed}} accordingly, that Mrs Clay {{should be of}} the party in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, <b>when</b> Anne, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain Wentworth walking down the street.|$|R
60|$|Now, she, {{with all}} her might of passionate and proud resentment, bent her dark glance from day to day, and hour to hour--from that night in her own chamber, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> gazing at the shadows on the wall, to the deeper night fast coming--upon one figure {{directing}} a crowd of humiliations and exasperations against her; and that figure, still her husband's.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down despair {{was visible}} on many countenances, and {{immediate}} starvation {{seemed to be}} waiting {{at the door to}} clutch them as they went out; for the impressible creatures believed every word and saw no salvation anywhere.|$|E

60|$|The keys lay in {{the palm}} of Maggie's hand. Her heart had begun to beat quickly.
