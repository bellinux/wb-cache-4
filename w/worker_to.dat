5|$|The German Football Association {{then sent}} {{him as a}} {{development}} <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> countries without national football structures. His first posting was in Myanmar (Burma), where he spent two years as the national coach, qualifying for the Olympics in 1972, and winning the President's Cup, a tournament contested by south-east Asian countries, later that year. His work subsequently took him to managing Tanzania, Liberia, Pakistan and North Yemen, until 1988, when he retired and settled in Spain.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains an attractive temporary <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> take her place while she is on maternity leave, and enlists Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) support when she tries to show that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) finds her replacement attractive. Meanwhile, Robert California (James Spader) surprises Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) when he requests to join their band.|$|E
5|$|Those ransomed were valued on {{a sliding}} scale, ranging from around 1,875DM for a manual <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> around 11,250DM for a doctor. The justification, {{according}} to East Germany, {{was that this}} was compensation for the money invested by the state in the prisoner's training. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000DM worth of goods.|$|E

5|$|Workers who {{are older}} {{typically}} start satellite nests {{and have more}} developed ovaries. Younger and lesser-developed workers join the satellite after its establishment. The distribution of workers between the main nest and satellite is very important because they are needed {{for the establishment of}} the satellite and for the continued running of the main nest. Although, after several months the main nest can become abandoned. If not enough workers follow the initial <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> the new nest, then it will most likely fail as a satellite.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant <b>worker,</b> <b>to</b> whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that these types of costs may explain why highly educated <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> a lesser extent evade taxes and work informally than low-educated workers. If highly educated <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> a smaller extent work in {{industries}} which handle cash payments and to a larger extent are subject to third-party reporting, {{it will be more}} difficult, and thus more costly, for these <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> evade taxes.|$|R

5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} consciousness {{of a variety}} of different races assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E

25|$|The Pharaoh ant is a {{polygynous}} {{species that}} has a relatively low <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> queen ratio of around 12.86. This allows the pharaoh ants {{to be able to}} exert social control over the size of the colony and the size of each caste. In the average nest, there are around 170 ± 8 queens every nest, which comprises around 5.2% of the total population, whereas there are around 2185 ± 49 workers, which make up around 66.6% of the population. This low <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> queen ratio is usually associated with swift changes in the nest and may be why pharaoh ants form many new nest buds quickly. To branch out and form a new bud nest, pharaoh ants need a minimum of 469 ± 28 individuals, which explains how they proliferate so quickly.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, {{previous}} to this EU jurisprudence, {{a series}} of laws introduced during the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's government restricted closed and union shops. All agreements requiring a <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> join a union are now illegal. In the United States, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 outlawed the closed shop.|$|E
25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance) will inspire the <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E
50|$|House Republicans {{proposed}} {{a bill that}} required state <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> pay {{a portion of their}} insurance premiums and allowed <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> opt out of union membership.

50|$|After the First World War {{one there}} were many {{attempts}} to establish a trade union law {{to protect the rights}} of <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> organize themselves, including a Department of Home Affairs bill in 1925, which would have prevented employers from discharging <b>workers</b> for belonging <b>to</b> a union, or requiring <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> quit (or not join) a union. But these bills never became law.|$|R
25|$|Aggression in {{the form}} of chasing and {{sometimes}} stinging is needed to defend the nests from predators and non-nestmates. Older females from different nests are chased away, as are predators such as Vespa tropica. Dominance relationships, mediated by aggression, control foraging amidst workers. Aggressive behavior is a crucial part of the transition from <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> queen.|$|E

25|$|If {{a patient}} doesn't want a {{healthcare}} <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> share confidential health information, {{they need to}} make this clear and discuss the matter with healthcare staff.
