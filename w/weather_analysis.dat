5|$|A surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is a type}} {{of weather}} map that depicts {{positions}} for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{maps are}} used to display {{information}} quickly showing the analysis of various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis,</b> which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis,</b> which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather forecast office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather forecast office for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. During the time that the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis</b> maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Vera can be ascertained {{back to a}} diffuse area of low {{pressure}} first incorporated into surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis</b> early on September20. At the time, the disturbance was situated between Guam and Chuuk State. Though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) did not classify the incipient system as a tropical cyclone, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) analyzed the disturbance to be a tropical depression as early as 0000UTC that day. Initially, the depression tracked westward, but transiently shifted to a more northerly course on September21. Late that day, a reconnaissance airplane dispatched by the JTWC to analyze the disturbance failed to reach its center due to engine failure. However, the data collected from the storm's periphery was sufficient enough for the warning center to classify the depression as a tropical storm at 1800UTC that day. Despite the flight data, the JMA had already determined the system to have been of at least tropical storm intensity six hours earlier. As a result of the reclassification, the tropical storm was designated the name Vera by the JTWC. At this point the tropical cyclone began to take a more westerly course.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis</b> {{concerns}} the timetable of developments related to surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis.</b> [...] Initially {{a tool of}} study for the behavior of storms, surface weather analyses became {{a work in progress}} to explain current weather and as an aid for short term weather forecasting. Initial efforts to create surface weather analyses began in the mid-19th century by using surface weather observations to analyze isobars, isotherms, and display temperature and cloud cover. By the mid-20th century, much more information was being placed upon the station models plotted on weather maps and surface fronts, per the Norwegian cyclone model, were being analyzed worldwide. Eventually, observation plotting went from a manual exercise to an automated task for computers and plotters. Surface analysis remains a manual and partially subjective exercise, whether it be via hand and paper, or via a workstation.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports a}} study of the {{chemical}} modifications of LLDPE/nanoblend nanocomposites exposed to UV light in conditions of artificially accelerated ageing and natural <b>weathering.</b> <b>Analysis</b> by infrared spectroscopy of the chemical modifications produced by photoageing shows that the presence of an organo-clay leads to the decrease of the oxidation induction time of the polymer (LLDPE), which results in lower durability of the nanocomposites. Protection against photooxidation was tested with different kinds of UV stabilizers and with a metal deactivator. It is shown that the metal deactivator is very efficient in stabilizing the nanocomposite since it totally cancels the prodegradant effect of the organo-clay. This confirms the role played by iron impurities in natural clays. The use of a metal deactivator offers a new insight into the stabilization strategy for nanocomposites...|$|R

500|$|On November9, a {{cold front}} {{moved into the}} {{northwest}} Caribbean Sea, shortly before an abnormally strong high-pressure system entered in the area. The front then became nearly stationary and interacted with several tropical waves over the next week. The Intertropical Convergence Zone became active, causing monsoonal southwesterly flow to enter the system from the eastern Pacific Ocean. On November13, surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis</b> indicated a weak low-pressure area had developed north of Colombia. Despite a well-defined low-level circulation, the system {{did not meet the}} criteria for a tropical cyclone because convective activity was not organized or concentrated within the vicinity of the center. Several small, weak centers of low pressure formed in the general area, and the entire system drifted northward for a couple days. In combination with a high-pressure area over the United States, the system produced gale-force winds on Florida, Cuba, the Bahamas and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
500|$|A surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{a special}} type of weather map which {{provides}} a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations. [...] Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea-level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts. [...] Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. [...] For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying fair weather. [...] An L {{on the other hand}} may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Low pressure also creates surface winds deriving from high pressure zones. [...] Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. [...] In addition, areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.|$|E
500|$|Midday on September 9, while {{tracking}} nearly due north, Edna's minimum central {{barometric pressure}} fell to , but {{is believed to}} have leveled off shortly thereafter. The radius of hurricane-force winds increased, and the storm may have become asymmetrical, with convection concentrated {{to the right of the}} center, although this was not confirmed due to a lack of data. An approaching weak frontal boundary spread overcast conditions over the Eastern Seaboard north of North Carolina. By September 10, Edna was located just south of Cape Hatteras, passing east of the Outer Banks early the next day. As the hurricane accelerated to the northeast, it began to deteriorate and weaken. Closely following the recent track of Hurricane Carol, Edna approached New England, but diverged from Carol's track upon skirting the eastern coast instead of moving inland. Weather reporting stations in the Mid-Atlantic States reported rapid clearing as the storm gained latitude, while heavy rain and gusty winds enveloped New England. On September 11, Edna passed directly over Cape Cod after weakening to Category 2 status, although surface <b>weather</b> <b>analysis</b> depicted a central pressure of [...] It subsequently tracked just east of Eastport, Maine. The storm continued northeastward into Atlantic Canada and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, although the exact time of this transition is unknown.

40|$|Tens of {{millions}} of people in Southeast Asia drink groundwater contaminated with naturally occurring arsenic. How arsenic is released from the sediment into the water remains poorly understood. Here, we show in laboratory experiments that phosphate-limited cells of Burkholderia fungorum mobilize ancillary arsenic from apatite. We hypothesize that arsenic mobilization is a by-product of mineral weathering for nutrient acquisition. The released arsenic does not undergo a redox transformation but appears to be solubilized from the apatite mineral lattice during <b>weathering.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of apatite from the source area in the Himalayan basin indicates the presence of elevated levels of arsenic, with an average concentration of 210 mg/kg. The rate of arsenic release is independent of the initial dissolved arsenic concentration and occurs at phosphate levels observed in Bangladesh aquifers. We also demonstrate the presence of the microbial phenotype that releases arsenic from apatite in Bangladesh aquifer sediments and groundwater. These results suggest that microbia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the promise of}} augmenting interactive multivariate representations with information from statistical processes {{in the domain of}} <b>weather</b> data <b>analysis.</b> Statistical regression, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistical calculations are integrated via graphical indicators into an enhanced parallel coordinates system, called the Multidimensional Data eXplorer (MDX). These statistical indicators, which highlight significant associations in the data, are complemented with interactive visual analysis capabilities. The resulting system allows a smooth, interactive, and highly visual workflow. The system’s utility is demonstrated with an extensive hurricane climate study that was conducted by a hurricane expert. In the study, the expert used a new data set of environmental weather data, composed of 28 independent variables, to predict annual hurricane activity. MDX shows the Atlantic Meridional Mode increases the explained variance of hurricane seasonal activity by 7 - 15 % and removes less significant variables used in earlier studies. The findings and feedback from the expert (1) validate the utility of the data set for hurricane prediction, and (2) indicate that the integration of statistical processes with interactive parallel coordinates, as implemented in MDX, addresses both deficiencies in traditional <b>weather</b> data <b>analysis</b> and exhibits some of the expected benefits of visual data analysis...|$|R
