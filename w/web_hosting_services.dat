2500|$|Web 1.0 is a retronym {{referring}} to {{the first stage of}} the World Wide Web's evolution. According to Cormode, G. and, Krishnamurthy, B. (2008): [...] "content creators were few in Web 1.0 with the vast majority of users simply acting as consumers of content." [...] Personal web pages were common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers, or on free <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>services</b> such as GeoCities. With the advent of Web 2.0, it was more common for the average web user to have social networking profiles on sites such as Myspace and Facebook, as well as personal blogs on one of the new low-cost <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>services</b> or a dedicated blog host like Blogger or LiveJournal. The content for both was generated dynamically from stored content, allowing for readers to comment directly on pages {{in a way that was}} not previously common.|$|E
2500|$|On July 10, 2010, a forum thread {{announced}} {{the opening of}} a new server, located in the Netherlands. This server allows works which are public domain in Canada and the EU to be downloaded legally, even if they are under copyright in the US. The server was initially run by an unaffiliated European organization, while a forum thread [...] later announced that operations had been handed over , a new unaffiliated company incorporated in New Zealand to [...] "provide <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>services</b> to online libraries that distribute free contents in any fields of arts and science". Files on the EU server are flagged (EU).|$|E
2500|$|Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, {{an online}} shared {{diary of a}} person's {{personal}} life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text {{was referred to as}} sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters. Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites. However, the evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of [...] "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, or they can be run using blog software, or on regular <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>services.</b> Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.|$|E
