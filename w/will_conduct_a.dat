5|$|The Skylon is a fully {{reusable}} {{single stage}} to orbit (SSTO) vehicle, {{able to achieve}} orbit without staging, which {{is intended to be}} used principally as a reusable launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound (3,800 miles per hour), to attain a peak altitude of roughly 92,000 feet, on the edge of low earth orbit (LEO), where payloads would typically be launched prior to the vehicle's re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it <b>will</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>a</b> relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon a runway.|$|E

The European Commission <b>will</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>a</b> {{review of the}} implementation of the Action Plan in the year 2012, and will assess the need for further action. In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around 85% of the EU’s GDP is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental (CO2, air pollution, noise) and competitiveness (congestion) terms {{while at the same time}} addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to health problems and demographic trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of persons with reduced mobility, families and children.|$|E

500|$|In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} a {{violation}} of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution occurs when prosecutors use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race. If a defendant alleges that a prosecutor challenged a prospective juror on the basis of that juror's race (a process known as a [...] "Batson challenge"), trial courts <b>will</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>a</b> three-part analysis of the peremptory challenge in question: [...] "irst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties’ submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination." [...] A court will only sustain a Batson challenge if all three elements of this test are satisfied. On appeal, a trial court's findings with respect to a Batson challenge will only be reversed if a trial court judge committed clear error. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that findings with respect to a prosecutor's explanation of the reasons for their use of peremptory challenges is [...] "entitled to 'great deference'".|$|E
