5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine <b>what</b> <b>gets</b> sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E

[...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but <b>what</b> <b>gets</b> you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist {{is the stuff of}} Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey."

[...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the opening scene of episode reminded him of when he was in second grade and got a puppy for Christmas. Jacobson said, [...] "I still recall the excitement when my mom brought [...] into school for the others to see, and the first segment of [...] reflects the atmosphere caused by a doggie visit.

[...] He also noted, [...] "And when Kesha talks about a 'place I know', where 'they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor' in the style of a six-grade camp ditty, it's hard for anyone to not feel the urge to just take it off." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave the single four out of five stars. He was concerned with the overall lyrical depth and over-use of auto-tune but he complimented the song for its [...] "irresistibly catchy beat and chorus" [...] with a [...] "celebratory mood of dropping inhibitions." [...] He noted that [...] "with the volume turned up and the chorus encouraging you to 'take it off,' you may just feel inspired to follow the commands. The ultimate effect by the end of the song is very cathartic as it hints strongly that there is more to [...] "take off" [...] than simply clothing." [...] Andrew Burgess from musicOMH wrote that on the song the singer [...] "oozes swagger." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix used [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of Kesha's songwriting, noting that tracks which weren't over-thought were [...] "fine". Newman wrote that [...] "thinking too much is <b>what</b> <b>gets</b> Kesha, who co-wrote the songs here, in trouble.

2500|$|Energy {{distribution}} {{measurements of}} field-emitted electrons were first reported in 1939. In 1959 it was realized theoretically by Young, and confirmed experimentally by Young and Mueller that the quantity measured in spherical geometry was {{the distribution of}} the total energy of the emitted electron (its [...] "total energy distribution"). This is because, in spherical geometry, the electrons move in such a fashion that angular momentum about a point in the emitter is very nearly conserved. Hence any kinetic energy that, at emission, is in a direction parallel to the emitter surface gets converted into energy associated with the radial direction of motion. So <b>what</b> <b>gets</b> measured in an energy analyzer is the total energy at emission.|$|E
