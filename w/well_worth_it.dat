500|$|Group members {{expressed}} {{just how}} demanding {{their role in}} the group had been, describing the job as [...] "hard work" [...] and [...] "a tough gig", with touring for nine months of every year and filming the television series for most of the remainder, creating little time in their lives for anything else. Members also saw importance of being [...] "career driven" [...] and in portraying a positive image of themselves to the public in their personal lives, being [...] "always on". However, the cast insisted that the stressful work was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to see a smile on a child's face, and described the bond between the members as [...] "like family". In 2005 Harding stated the lifestyle was [...] "quite hard in the beginning."

She expressed that the following years she spent with the group were her favourite, and that she was proud of her decision to continue.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E

The wisdom of her later days had confirmed the judgment of her youth. As regards Bottles himself, she had soon got over that fancy; for years she had scarcely thought of him, till Sir Eustace told her that he was coming home, and she had that curious dream about him. Now he had come and made love to her, not in a civilised, philandering sort of a way, such as she was accustomed to, but with a passion and a fire and an utter self-abandonment which, while it thrilled her nerves with a curious sensation of mingled pleasure and pain, not unlike that she once experienced at a Spanish bull-fight when she saw a man tossed, was yet extremely awkward to deal with and rather alarming.|$|E

Now, though--even if we {{had given}} ten minutes of digression--the lessons in this picture would have been <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it,</b> I have not, in taking you to it, gone {{out of my own}} way. There is a special point for us to observe in those dark peacocks. If you look at the notes on the Venetian {{pictures}} in the end of my [...] "Stones of Venice," [...] you will find it especially dwelt upon as singular that Tintoret, in his picture of [...] "The Nativity," [...] has a peacock without any color in it. And the reason of it is also that Tintoret belongs, with the full half of his mind, as Rubens does, to the Greek school. But the two men reach the same point by opposite paths. Tintoret begins with what Venice taught him, and adopted what Athens could teach: but Rubens begins with Athens, and adopts from Venice. Now if you will look back to my fifth Lecture[9] you will find it said that the colorists can always adopt as much chiaroscuro as suits them, and so become perfect; but the chiaroscurists cannot, on their part, adopt color, except partially. And accordingly, whenever Tintoret chooses, he can laugh Rubens to scorn in management of light and shade; but Rubens only here and there--as far as I know myself, only this once--touches Tintoret or Giorgione in color.|$|E
