It {{is unlikely that the}} solution in any one place will serve as a template or road map {{that can be used to}} navigate very different terrain. One of the most important approaches that <b>we</b> can take <b>when</b> dealing with difficult social and political issues is to think about the issue from the point of view of the minority (<b>when</b> <b>we</b> find ourselves in the religious or political majority) and from the point of view of the majority (<b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a political or religious minority). Ultimately, all of us benefit from the realization that, when it comes to religion, we all belong to a religious minority. In the flat, crowded and dangerous world in which <b>we</b> live, there <b>is</b> no such thing as a religious majority. Even Christians, with their billion or so, and Muslims, with their billion or so, are a religious minority <b>when</b> <b>we</b> think from a global perspective. Remembering the rights and interests of minorities is especially important at times <b>when</b> <b>we</b> find ourselves in temporary or localized majorities. Our claims to be treated fairly and with respect <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the minority will <b>be</b> stronger if <b>we</b> treat others fairly and with respect <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the majority...|$|R

And we – his friends – are the living witnesses to his enduring influence for over half a century, he built an empire of friendship, embracing students, scholars and all Jews, regardless of status or station in life And yet, he was more than teacher, colleague, and friend. He was a gifted spiritual mentor, a masgiach ruchani, whose wisdom kindled light <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> darkness, whose counsel brought direction <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lost <b>in</b> confusion, whose encouragement offered hope <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> caught <b>in</b> despair.
