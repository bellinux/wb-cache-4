[...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying...</b> it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E

When he {{returned}} {{after the end of}} the fifth season, he presented Davies with a script and CD, complete with notated and orchestrated music, which Davies found [...] "mind-boggling". The actors were initially bewildered; in 2012, James Marsters commented that [...] "it's obvious now that they were good songs but the thing was Joss and his wife Kai, they don't sing very well. And they don't play piano very well. The songs sounded really cheesy and horrible... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Joss, you're ruining our careers.'" ...|$|E

Speaking of this ritual in the film [...] (1977), gay journalist George Mendenhall said: [...] "It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn...and {{to be able to put}} your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens'...we were really not saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.' <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> 'We have our rights, too.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{licensing}} arm of Paramount {{took the}} step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores (Hot Topic, Spencer's) to big chains (Target, J.C. Penney), which involved carefully stripping T-shirts of racy slogans {{from the television}} show. Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast-food chains and Hollywood movie studios, which was particularly tough for South Park, as no fast-food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show's racy content. Eventually, J.C. Penney ended the tie-ins with the show in April 1999 {{as a result of}} customer complaints. On July 7, 1999, Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the film's release. During the interview, Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O'Brien, played by Brett Spiner, hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night. Upon seeing the clip, a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was [...] "really funny", but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as {{on the top floor of}} the GE Building, when it was really on the sixth floor. The film also suffered negative publicity before release. It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre, a friend of the killers (Chris Morris) was seen wearing a black T-shirt depicting characters from South Park. Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado, and Stone went to Heritage High School, not far from Columbine High. He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings. [...] "Nothing seemed funny after that," [...] he said. South Park was, at the time, generally waning in popularity: ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series' third season and, according to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "it [...] the pop-culture behemoth it was last year [...]" [...] In response to the decline, Parker commented, [...] "Suddenly we suck and we're not cool anymore. The funny thing is, last year <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> the same things and we were hip, fresh, and cute. Now they're telling us we're pushing 30, we're failures, and we're sellouts." ...|$|E

Leaders of Popular Will told Venezuelans to keep protesting until the Venezuelan government provided changes and said that the previous day peace talks had taken place in [...] "unfair conditions", during which [...] "a sole party acted as moderator".

2500|$|Most {{songs of}} the album exceed nine minutes, {{but there are two}} {{instrumental}} songs of short duration. These two instrumental songs are [...] "Silhouette" [...] and [...] "Requiem". The first song was recorded just hours before they were leaving the studio and is a brief piano interlude. They were impressed that Anders Nordin played the piano very well. Lindgren said, [...] "I remember the look on Dan's face when we said, 'Our drummer can play the piano.' He didn't believe a word <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> Dan can play the piano. Most guys play like shit. When Anders started playing, Dan was actually impressed." [...] Åkerfeldt later said, [...] "I'm still quite impressed." [...] The other instrumental is an acoustic epic, according to Lindgren. Åkerfeldt borrowed a Spanish acoustic guitar called a Trameleuc from a guitar store to play the song.|$|E

After 20 years of exile, he started his first speech at his old university with: [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> in the last lecture". As a left-leaning republican he was disappointed with {{the victory of the}} Christian Democratic party in the 1948 general election in Italy and the influence of the Catholic church in the country. Salvemini hoped that the Action Party, a post-war political party that emerged from Giustizia e Libertà, could provide a third force, a socialist-republican coalition uniting reformist socialists and genuine democrats as an alternative for the Communists and the Christian Democrats. However, his hopes for a new Italy declined with the restoration of old attitudes and institutions with the start of the Cold War.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time.

2500|$|Three {{music videos}} were created for [...] "One". The first, {{directed}} by Anton Corbijn, was filmed in Berlin and features {{the band members}} performing at Hansa Studios interspersed with footage of Trabants (an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe) and shots of them dressed in drag. Bono explained that the idea to crossdress [...] "had been {{based on the idea}} that if U2 can't do this, we've got to do it!", and it was fostered by the group's experiences dressing in drag for the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. However, the band pulled the video, fearing the single's status as an AIDS benefit would result in critics finding AIDS-related interpretations of the video. The Edge explained, [...] "We didn't want to be involved in putting back the AIDS issue into the realm of sexuality... It wasn't worth the risk of people imagining <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> something about the AIDS issue through the drag footage, which was totally not what we were trying to say." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the role}} of River Song, whom {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies described as [...] "sort of the Doctor's wife", the production sought to cast Kate Winslet. One of Winslet's first acting roles was in the BBC1 teen drama Dark Season, written by Davies. The role of River Song eventually went to Alex Kingston, known for starring in the popular US drama ER. On Kingston's casting, Davies said, [...] "I bloody love her!" [...] Kingston had {{been a fan of}} Doctor Who as a child. Kingston, when first cast, did not expect her role to be recurring. She later learned that Moffat had always intended for Song to come back for return appearances. Kingston enjoys getting to play an unusual action hero female role, and praises the show for its variety of settings and opportunities [...] "to relive one's childhood fantasies" [...] playing with laser guns and wearing varied costumes from one appearance to the next. With regard to having to speak complicated dialogue, she said, [...] "I'd work with a medical consultant on ER, who'd explain what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> so I'd say it with a purpose and a truth. On Doctor Who, I've no idea what some of my lines mean!" ...|$|E
