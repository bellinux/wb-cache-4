Analysis of 2000 – 2100 melt anomalies compared to melt results over 1980 – 1999 reveals an exponential relationship of the GrIS surface melt rate simulated by MAR to the near-surface temperature (TAS) anomalies, mainly due to the surface albedo positive feedback associated with the extension of bare ice areas in summer. On the GrIS margins, the future melt anomalies are rather driven by stronger sensible heat fluxes, induced by enhanced <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advections</b> over the ice sheet. Over the central dry snow zone, the increase of melt surpasses the negative feedback from heavier snowfall inducing therefore a decrease of the summer surface albedo even {{at the top of}} the ice sheet. In addition to the incoming longwave flux increase associated to the atmosphere warming, MAR projects an increase of the cloud cover decreasing the ratio of the incoming shortwave versus longwave radiation and dampening the albedo feedback. However, it should be noted that this trend in the cloud cover is contrary to that simulated by ERA-INTERIM-forced MAR over current climate, where the observed melt increase since the 1990 's seems rather to be a consequence of more anticyclonic atmospheric conditions.

Interannual variations in snowmelt onset are likely related to large-scale variations in atmospheric circulation, such as described by the Arctic Oscillation (AO). This research therefore examines the relationship between monthly-averaged AO values and mean annual snowmelt-onset dates over Arctic sea ice in 13 regions, from 1979 to 1998. The objective is to statistically relate variations in mean annual regional snowmelt-onset dates to variations in the AO.

For the purpose of this paper, heat waves and warm spells were identified based on daily maximum temperatures recorded at 27 weather stations located in Romania over a 55 -year period (1961 – 2015). The intensity threshold was the 90 th percentile, and the length of an event was of minimum three consecutive days. We analyzed 111 heat wave and warm spell events totaling 423 days. The classification of synoptic conditions was based on daily reanalysis at three geopotential levels and on the online version of a backward trajectories model. The main findings are that there are two major types of genetic conditions.

40|$|Researchers {{have been}} {{exploring}} methods {{to facilitate the}} prediction of rapidly intensifying surface cyclones. Recognizing that synoptic-scale systems, such as these cyclones, are less predictable at medium range and beyond than are planetary-scale circulations, researchers propose that the planetary-scale environment for explosive cyclogenesis could be better predicted than the cyclones themselves. Researchers have therefore constructed a planetary-scale climatology of explosive cyclogenesis by compositing together filtered 500 mb height fields (retaining planetary waves only) corresponding to a large sample of rapidly intensifying surface cyclones, stratified geographically {{and according to the}} direction of 500 mb geostrophic flow (southwesterly, northwesterly or westerly) over the cyclone center. The composites are calculated from five days preceding to five days following each rapid cyclogenesis event, and have climatology subtracted so that the evolution of planetary-scale anomalies before and after cyclogenesis can be followed. Whether the anomalies are distinct from background variability and thus provide predictive value is now being evaluated. Following explosive cyclogenesis over which the filtered 500 mb flow is southwesterly, there appear in the composites large positive 500 mb height anomalies downstream. In some cases, these anomalies are associated with blocking patterns. Whether the objectively-defined blocking patterns in the data set are preceded by upstream intense surface cyclone activity is being investigated. Finally, the contribution of synoptic-scale processes, notably <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advection,</b> to planetary-scale height rises during a block formation following an explosive cyclogenesis event is being diagnosed.

40|$|Greenland {{ice sheet}} mass loss has {{accelerated}} {{in the past}} decade responding to combined glacier discharge and surface melt water runoff increases. During summer, absorbed solar energy, modulated at the surface primarily by albedo, is the dominant factor governing surface melt variability in the ablation area. Using satellite observations of albedo and melt extent with calibrated regional climate model output, we determine the spatial dependence and quantitative impact of the ice sheet albedo feedback in twelve summer periods beginning in 2000. We find that while the albedo feedback is negative over 70 % of the ice sheet, concentrated in the accumulation area above 1500 m, positive feedback prevailing over the ablation area accounts {{for more than half of}} the overall increase in melting. Over the ablation area, year 2010 and 2011 absorbed solar energy was more than twice as large as in years 2000 – 2004. Anomalous anticyclonic circulation, associated with a persistent summer North Atlantic Oscillation extreme since 2007 enabled three amplifying mechanisms to maximize the albedo feedback: (1) increased <b>warm</b> (south) <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> along the western ice sheet increased surface sensible heating that in turn enhanced snow grain metamorphic rates, further reducing albedo; (2) increased surface downward solar irradiance, leading to more surface heating and further albedo reduction; and (3) reduced snowfall rates sustained low albedo, maximizing surface solar heating, progressively lowering albedo over multiple years.

40|$|On 28 August 1999, a tornadic storm {{developed}} during the afternoon over the Gudar range, near the border between Teruel and Castello ́n provinces (Sistema Ibérico, eastern Spain). The area has a characteristic complex terrain with peaks up to 2000 m. At least one tornado developed, which attained F 3 intensity, producing severe damage in the forest that covers the mountains. The region is well known as a summer convective storm nest and, not surprisingly, a range in the Sistema Iberico is called Sierra del Rayo (lightning range). The meteorological situation on 28 August 1999 shows {{the presence of a}} thermal low over the Iberian peninsula, producing <b>warm</b> and moist <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> towards inland Castellon at low levels. Meanwhile, a cold trough crossed the Iberian Peninsula from west to east at upper levels. Deep convection is identified on the Meteosat images during the afternoon, when the upper level trough reached the area where warm and humid Mediterranean air was concentrated. The radar images reveal signals indicating the supercellular character of the tornado-producing storm. Weak echo region, frontal and rear inflow notches are identified on the low-level CAPPIs images. In order to study the roles of the orography and the solar radiation on the ingredients associated with the tornadic storm development, numerical simulations of the event were performed, using the non- hydrostatic MM 5 model. Very fine grid resolution, up to 2 km in the horizontal, allows us to determine the role of the complex terrain in favoring environmental conditions associated with the onset of severe convection. In fact, interaction of certain low-level flows with particular topographic features with scales of about 20 to 50 km is found to generate intense small-scale circulations over the storm nesting region. A more detailed analysis of the orographic effect shows that fine scale terrain features (2 - 5 km) are responsible for the intensification of the convective storms, whereas modification of the low-level flow by the large-scale features (20 - 50 km) is able to trigger the convective systems. The effect of the solar-induced surface heating is also analyzed and it turns to be crucial not only by intensifying the Iberian thermal low and the easterly <b>warm</b> and moist <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> towards the area but also by promoting mountain breezes. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Na primeira semana de maio de 2008, durante quatro dias, um ciclone em superfície permaneceu semi-estacionário na costa da região sul do Brasil. Este sistema foi responsável por chuvas e ventos fortes no Rio Grande do Sul e Santa Catarina, os quais causaram muitos danos (queda de árvores, enchentes e desabamentos). O objetivo deste trabalho é avaliar o processo de formação e entender os mecanismos responsáveis pelo lento deslocamento do ciclone, já que a maioria dos ciclones nesta região possui deslocamento mais rápido. A equação de desenvolvimento de Sutcliffe mostrou que a advecção de vorticidade absoluta ciclônica na média troposfera e a advecção de ar quente na camada entre 1000 - 500 hPa foram mecanismos importantes para a ciclogênese. Neste período, o intenso aquecimento diabático também contribuiu para a ciclogênese, à medida que se contrapôs ao intenso resfriamento adiabático devido aos movimentos verticais ascendentes. A advecção de vorticidade absoluta ciclônica que favoreceu a ciclogênese esteve associada a um Vórtice Ciclônico em Altos Níveis (VCAN), que se formou numa região de anomalia de vorticidade potencial. O VCAN se manteve semi-estacionário e compôs o setor norte de um bloqueio do tipo dipolo. Tal bloqueio intensificou um anticiclone em superfície, situado a sul/leste do ciclone, o que contribuiu para o ciclone se manter semi-estacionário. O movimento atípico e lento do ciclone para sul, e em alguns períodos para sudoeste, esteve associado com advecções de vorticidade absoluta ciclônica na média troposfera e de ar quente no seu setor sul. Somente quando o bloqueio em níveis médios e a anomalia de vorticidade potencial em níveis médios/altos se enfraqueceram, o ciclone em superfície se afastou da costa sul do Brasil. On {{the first}} week of May 2008, during four days, a semi-stationary surface cyclone acted over the coast of {{southern}} Brazil. This system was responsible for large amount of rain and strong near surface winds over Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina causing many damages (fallen trees, floodings and landslides). This work evaluated cyclone development process to understand the reasons for its slow displacement, once most cyclones developed in this region move faster. The Sutcliffe development equation showed that cyclonic absolute vorticity advection in middle troposphere, and positive thermal advection in layer between 1000 - 500 hPa were important mechanisms for cyclogenesis processes. In this same period, diabatic heating also contributes to cyclogenesis as far as it was opposite to adiabatic cooling due to strong upward movement. Cyclonic absolute vorticity advection which propitiated cyclogenesis was associated with an Upper Level Cyclonic Vortex (ULCV) developed in a potential vorticity anomaly region. The ULCV was semi-stationary and part of a blocking dipole pattern. This blocking intensified a surface anticyclone at south/east of the cyclone, contributing to the cyclone staying semi-stationary near the coast of southern Brazil. The slow and unusual surface cyclone movement to south and sometimes to southwest was associated with middle level cyclonic absolute vorticity and <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advections</b> in their southern sector.

Data from 22 proximity soundings from these cases revealed a strong baro-clinic environment with strong vertical wind shear and <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> from just above the suiface through 500 mb. This advection was reasoned to provide a constant source for destabilization from lifting above the frontal inversion. Convective instability was noted in all cases above the bound-ary layer with stability indices revealing the most unstable parcel located near the 850 -mb layer. Despite quite cool and stable suiface conditions, CAPE, best lifted index and total-totals index values suggested at least a marginal degree of instability was required for cold-sector, severe thunderstorm development. After examining the proximity soundings, PCGRIDDS data were then analyzed to determine whichfore-cast fields from the ETA model best delineated cold-sector, severe thunderstorm development. Reports of severe weather occurred VelY near the ETA model forecast, 850 -mb, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> maximum. In addition, a majority of reports occurred along the axis of strongest 850 -mb theta-e advection. Con-structed cross-sections normal to isotherms or thickness con-tours showed where areas of elevated or slightly sloped theta-e sUlfaces were located above the frontal suiface. These areas of potential convective instability combined with upward verti-cal velocity fields correlated well with the location of subse-quent severe thunderstorm reports. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface stress}} is {{computed}} by the method of geostrophic departures using 23 days of double theodolite wind observations at Shilo, Manitoba. The main results are as follows. Relations between the stress and the geostrophic wind fit these data better than do similar expressions using the surface wind. The stress varies linearly, rather than quadratically, with wind speed. For a given surface or geostrophic wind speed, the stress increases with increasing Richardson number and <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advection.</b> This paper is concerned with computing the stress ‘P~ (force per unit area) exerted by the atmosphere on the earth. Some simple relationships that could readily be incorporated into a numerical weather prediction model are examined. This study was to some extent motivated by {{a recent study of}} one of the authors (Danard 1969). In the latter papor, it was demonstrated that a cyclone would experience simcant changes in its velocity fields and rate of frictional filling as it moved over a surface of varying roughness (for example, land to sea). Consequently, if ti numerical model is to simulate the behavior of such cyclones, the surface stress must be carefully calculated. In section 2, an independent method of computing 1 p 0 is discussed (the method of geostrophic departures). The data used and sources of error are discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 is concerned with relationships between ‘P ~ and Vo (surface wind) and V, (geostrophic wind). For the data sample of this study, 8, is a better predictor than Vo for ‘P~, and a linear dependence of ‘P ~ on wind speed is preferable to a quadratic one. Dependence on Richardson number and temperature advection is examined in section 6. For a given surface or geostrophic wind speed, the stress is larger for <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> or high Richardson number than for cold air advection or low Richardson number. The basic data used in this study are presented in the appendix...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the formation and}} evolution of a Cut-off low over the Tropical East Pacific (southwestern of Peru), occurred between June 29 and July 08 in 2004. The snowstorm associated to this system, affected the poorest regions of Peru (South Mountain) leaving a tragic balance of 4766 destroyed houses, 1703 Has of lost crops, 260505 dead animals (cattle, ovine, goat and mainly auquénidos) and deterioration of the settlers health (INDECI, 2004). There were two components in this study: 1) the precursory formation flows of the Cut-off low, were analyzed and 2) it was determined {{the contribution of the}} dynamic and thermal forcing of high and middle troposphere. The analysis of flows shows that the genesis of the Cut-off low, in its initial stage was preceded by the amplification of one ridge on the Tropical and Subtropical Pacific, later by the northeast side of this ridge a short-wave trough- Jet Streak system propagates through the longer-wave-amplyfing ridge, favoring the incursion of stratospheric air. Meanwhile, on continent the formation of a anticyclonic circulation at middle and low levels with northeast winds on the Amazonia, supported the <b>warm</b> and humid <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> towards the South mountain range and Altiplano Peruvian-Bolivian that when interacting with the above mentioned mechanisms, favored the occurrence of intense snowstorms over a great extension of the Peruvian Andes.

40|$|See {{enclosed}} abstract-and-contents. pdfThe Greenland {{ice sheet}} (GrIS) surface mass balance (SMB) was modelled at different spatial resolutions (15 - 50 km), using the regional climate model MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional) {{forced by the}} ERA-INTERIM reanalysis over the 1990 - 2010 period. The comparison of these simulations revealed that (i) the inter-annual variability of the SMB components is consistent within the different resolutions investigated when they are integrated over the whole ice sheet, (ii) the MAR model simulates heavier precipitation on average over the GrIS with decreasing resolution, and (iii) the SMB components (except precipitation) {{can be derived from}} a lower-resolution simulation with an enhanced interpolation. This interpolation {{can also be used to}} approximate the SMB components over another topography/ice sheet mask of the GrIS. These results are valuable for the forcing of an ice dynamical model, needed to enable full projections of the GrIS mass balance contribution to sea-level rise (SLR) over the coming centuries. Moreover, this work showed that 25 km-resolution MAR simulation is a good compromise between computing time and results precision in the aim to perform afterwards 21 st-century projections of the GrIS melt. The most suited atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for the GrIS current climate modelling were selected on the basis of comparison between the 1970 - 1999 outputs and reanalyses, showing that the representation quality of surface parameters (temperature, precipitation) are highly correlated to the atmospheric circulation and its inter-annual variability (North Atlantic oscillation). Future atmospheric circulation changes according to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios were projected to dampen the zonal flow, enhance the meridional fluxes and provide additional heat and moisture to the GrIS, increasing temperature over the whole ice sheet and precipitation over its northeastern area. Moreover, future projections performed with the selected AOGCMs showed consistent anomalies to the present-day climate. The GrIS SMB anomalies from the A 1 B scenario amount to - 300 Gt/yr with respect to 1970 - 1999, leading to a SLR of 5 cm by the end of the 21 st century. This work helped to select the AOGCMs used as forcing fields in the MAR model to carry out future projections of the GrIS. 20 th and 21 st centuries MAR simulations at 25 km resolution forced by previously selected GCMs according to GHG scenarios were performed over the GrIS in order to investigate the projected changes of the surface energy balance (SEB) components driving the surface melt. Analysis of 2000 - 2100 melt anomalies to 1980 – 1999 results revealed an exponential relationship of the surface melt to the near-surface temperature anomalies, mainly due to the surface albedo positive feedback associated with the extension of bare ice areas in summer. On the GrIS margins, the future melt anomalies are driven by stronger sensible heat fluxes, induced by enhanced <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>advections.</b> Over the central dry snow zone, the increase of melt surpasses the negative feedback from heavier snowfall inducing a decrease of the summer surface albedo. In addition to the incoming longwave flux increase associated to the atmosphere warming, MAR projected an increase of the cloud cover decreasing the ratio of the incoming shortwave versus longwave radiation and dampening the albedo feedback. This trend of cloud cover is contrary to that simulated by reanalyses-forced MAR over current climate, where the observed melt increase since the 1990 ’s is rather a consequence of more anticyclonic atmospheric conditions. No significant change was projected in the length of the melt season, highlighting the importance of solar radiation in the melt SEB...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{contributions}} of light absorbing snow impurities and glacial microbes to recent abrupt melting of snow/ice in Greenland as part of “Snow impurity and Glacial Microbe effects on the abrupt warming in the Arctic (SIGMA) ” Project, two automatic weather stations (AWS) were installed at the sites SIGMA-A (78 ° 03 ’N, 67 ° 38 ’W, 1, 490 m a. s. l.) on Greenalnd Ice Sheet (GrIS) and SIGMA-B (77 ° 31 ’N, 69 ° 04 ’W, 944 m a. s. l.) on Qaanaaq Ice Cap in northwestern Greenland in July 2012. After that the meteorological elements have been measured successfully during one year. Figure 1 depicts the results of air temperatures and snow surface level which indicate that the 2013 summer at SIGMA-A was much colder than 2012 and annual mass balance was positive at the both sites. At SIGMA-A the monthly mean air temperatures in July 2012 and 2013 were 0. 2 °C and - 4. 1 °C, respectively, and annual mass balance was + 102 cm (snow pit result 110 cm). Although the snow surface level decreased by several centimeters in 2012 summer period at SIGMA-A, snow accumulated continueouly in 2013 summer. At SIGMA-B the surface conditions in the 2011 and 2012 summers were bare ice at which glacial microbes covered. However, the snow cover has survived over the 2013 summer at SIGMA-B together with the wide areas higher than 700 m on Qaanaaq Ice Cap. Annual mass balance at SIGMA-B was + 68 cm. These contrasting result of meteorological elements between 2012 and 2013 is related with the large-scale circulation patterns around Greenland and the Arctic Ocean. In 2012 the surface melting of GrIS was considerably higher than normal along the western GrIS coast {{as a result of}} the enhanced <b>warm</b> southerly <b>air</b> <b>advection</b> associated with the abnormal persistence of anticyclonic circulation centered in South Greenland (Tedesco et al., 2013). However, anticyclonic circulation was centered in the Arctic Ocean, northwest of Greenland in 2013 summer. Furthermore, high albedo due to frequent snowfalls on Qaanaaq Ice Cap in 2013 summer would suppress the surface melting at SIGMA-B. 第 4 回極域科学シンポジウム個別セッション：[OM] 気水圏 11 月 15 日（金） 統計数理研究所 ３階セミナー室１（D 305...|$|R
