25|$|Chinese and Japanese Zen is {{grounded}} on the Chinese {{understanding of the}} Buddha-nature as one true's essence, and the Two truths doctrine as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality. Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or Buddha-nature, thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality. In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and shikan-taza, sitting meditation, is {{the expression of the}} already existing Buddhahood. Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a break-through insight in this Buddha-nature, but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life, as expressed in the Three mysterious Gates, the Four <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>Knowing</b> of Hakuin, and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. The Japanese Zen-scholar D.T. Suzuki noted similarities between Zen-Buddhism and Christian mysticism, especially meister Eckhart.|$|E

25|$|Ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{have been in}} {{dialogue}} for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting {{with the natural world}} may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, some have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan. Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture. The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike. Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity. It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.|$|E
500|$|In {{the chapter}} [...] "Scully as a Pragmatist Feminist" [...] {{of the book}} The Philosophy of The X-Files, Erin McKenna argues that [...] "all things" [...] {{represents}} an [...] "important shift" [...] in Scully's approach to science, knowledge acquisition, {{and the pursuit of}} the truth. She reasons that the events of the episode open Scully's mind to new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing,</b> specifically citing [...] "auras, chakras, visions... and the importance of coincidence". McKenna notes that Scully's shift in perspective is a shift to American pragmatism, a belief that reality is ever-changing. Pragmatists believe [...] "the truth is out there"—the motto of the series—in a manner similar to Mulder's. In [...] "all things", Scully begins to embrace pragmatism, although she still clings to her skeptic roots. Mixing the two, Scully evolves from a mere skeptic who demands proof to validate a truth, to an empiricist who wants proof, but is open to other perspectives.|$|E

According to Nasser's vice president Zakaria Mohieddin, although [...] "Amer had absolute authority over the armed forces, Nasser had his <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> what was really going on". Moreover, Amer anticipated an impending Israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike. Nasser refused the call upon determination {{that the air force}} lacked pilots and Amer's handpicked officers were incompetent. Still, Nasser concluded that if Israel attacked, Egypt's quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off Israeli forces for at least two weeks, allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire. Towards the end of May, Nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war, under increased pressure to act by both the general Arab populace and various Arab governments. On 26 May Nasser declared, [...] "our basic objective will be to destroy Israel". On 30 May, King Hussein committed Jordan in an alliance with Egypt and Syria.|$|E

2500|$|The third chapter, [...] "Making Magic: Training the Imagination", {{begins with}} Magliocco's {{assertion}} that the unifying feature of the Pagan movement is the ritual experiences that its practitioners undertake. Devoting {{the rest of the}} chapter to an examination of how Pagans [...] "conceive of and practice magic", she argues that they do not do so in order to escape rationality, but rather they adopt a belief in magic in order to reclaim [...] "traditional <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> that privilege the imagination". Noting that within Paganism, artists are viewed as magicians, she suggests that magic should itself viewed as an art, with both having the goal of bringing about emotional reactions and changes of consciousness. Exploring the various different definitions of [...] "magic" [...] developed within anthropology, Magliocco notes that most contemporary North Americans equate [...] "magic" [...] with superstition and irrational behavior. She then looks at Pagan understandings of magic, highlighting that Pagans typically try to rationalize magic, viewing it as an energy force in an interconnected universe, one that must obey natural laws, rather than as some un-explainable [...] "supernatural" [...] force. Moving on, Magliocco discusses the Pagan concept of a sacred universe, looking at the veneration of the natural world and the celebration of seasonal Sabbats, and the relevance that that has for Pagan magical beliefs. Exploring Pagan ethics surrounding the practice of magic, in particular the Wiccan Rede and the Law of Threefold Return, Magliocco also studies the manner in which Pagans have re-adopted vernacular magic as a part of their religious practices.|$|E

40|$|A common {{understanding}} is that dyslexia is the inability to spell words, the inability to recall symbols, the inability to recognize sight words, or the inability to decode. Dyslexia is often described in deficiency language—the inability to do something. Deficiency language {{is a product of}} special education and continues to dominate {{common understanding}}s of dyslexia. Additionally, special education views dyslexia as an isolated variable, an object to assess, measure, and rehabilitate, and does not take into consideration systemic factors that may influence learning. In this dissertation, I ask three primary research questions: (1) What are the influential areas of study in the academy that have shaped our contemporary understanding of dyslexia? (2) What is a dyslexic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> and writing? How can we make our classrooms more accessible? And (3) What can we learn about the educational institution from a dyslexic positionality? After reviewing the literature on dyslexia from the areas of special education, disability studies in education, critical communication pedagogy, and crip theory, I identify that dyslexia tends to be object of study, and very few people who identify as dyslexic are writing about dyslexia. The dyslexic scholar is rendered invisible. An undergirding principle of this dissertation is that dyslexia becomes visible only through communication: the miss-reading of a sign, a miss-spelled word, a misunderstood text, mistakes. If we come to know the world through writing and communication, then the “mistakes” that are common to dyslexia are actually another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> the world, a legitimate <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing.</b> Through performative writing, I articulate a dyslexic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing,</b> and show how this <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> can help us rethink course design and classroom communication. I also offer course design strategies that aim to disrupt ritualized educational practices, subvert scriptocentricism, embrace universal design for learning, and promote personalized education. In the process, I legitimize a dyslexic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> know, and by effect, legitimize dyslexia...|$|R

60|$|I will {{state at}} the outset the view which I shall aim at establishing. I believe that the stuff of our mental life, as opposed to its {{relations}} and structure, consists wholly of sensations and images. Sensations are connected with matter {{in the way that}} I tried to explain in Lecture V, i.e. each is a member of a system which is a certain physical object. Images, though they USUALLY have certain characteristics, especially lack of vividness, that distinguish them from sensations, are not INVARIABLY so distinguished, and cannot therefore be defined by these characteristics. Images, as opposed to sensations, can only be defined by their different causation: they are caused by association with a sensation, not by a stimulus external to the nervous system--or perhaps one should say external to the brain, where the higher animals are concerned. The occurrence of a sensation or image does not in itself constitute knowledge but any sensation or image may come to be known if the conditions are suitable. When a sensation--like the hearing of a clap of thunder--is normally correlated with closely similar sensations in our neighbours, we regard it as giving knowledge of the external world, since we regard the whole set of similar sensations as due to a common external cause. But images and bodily sensations are not so correlated. Bodily sensations can be brought into a correlation by physiology, and thus take their place ultimately among sources of knowledge of the physical world. But images cannot be made to fit in with the simultaneous sensations and images of others. Apart from their hypothetical causes in the brain, they have a causal connection with physical objects, through {{the fact that they are}} copies of past sensations; but the physical objects with which they are thus connected are in the past, not in the present. These images remain private in a sense in which sensations are not. A sensation SEEMS to give us knowledge of a present physical object, while an image does not, except when it amounts to a hallucination, and in this case the seeming is deceptive. Thus the whole context of the two occurrences is different. But in themselves they do not differ profoundly, and there is no reason to invoke two different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> for the one and for the other. Consequently introspection as a separate kind of knowledge disappears.|$|E
