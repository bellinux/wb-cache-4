[...] "On August 15th, at noon in broad daylight when everybody was eating lunch, I hit the road. Yes, I was afraid. Am I gonna live or die?

2500|$|On 11 October 2004, Blasko {{released}} her debut studio album, The Overture & the Underscore, {{which had been}} recorded in Hollywood at the studio of engineer Wally Gagel {{during the first half}} of the year. She co-produced the album with Gagel and fellow songwriter Robert F. Cranny. Gagel engineered and mixed the album, with assistance from Bruce MacFarlane. Joey Waronker (Beck, Atoms for Peace) played drums and percussion on all songs, while Cranny played various instruments on the album. Blasko recalled: [...] "I stayed in a backpackers hostel right near Hollywood Boulevard and worked on the album six days a week for two months ... I really wanted there to be something pretty classic about it. I was honestly surprised by what a 'complete' record it sounded to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> away from it".|$|E

60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. This is outrageous. When I {{tried to}} {{step off the}} pier on to the road, I {{received}} a shock, followed by an attack of pins and needles which ceased only <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back on to the stones.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{on shore}} at Rotterdam, my first {{proceeding}} {{was to ask}} {{my way to the}} English Consulate.

60|$|The child ran {{to meet me}} {{with open}} arms <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out on the landing. My manhood had {{sustained}} me through the parting with the mother.

5000|$|Soldado {{returned}} to Real Madrid where, on 11 July 2007, he renewed {{his contract with}} the team until 30 June 2012. In a 21 July interview with Spanish newspaper Diario AS, he revealed {{that he would be}} wearing number 9 shirt in his second stint: [...] "During the preseason I'll be number 9, the number I've always dreamed of. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> onto the pitch at the Bernabéu I'll remember all the hard work it took to get here". However, he finished the campaign with just five league appearances (one start, at Deportivo de La Coruña), the second with fewer minutes for the league champions.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{inside the}} cabin it was dark, and {{coming from the}} bright light I could not for a moment see what the {{interior}} looked like. Presently I made out one large room with no opening except the door. There was a tumble-down stone fireplace at one end, and at the other a rude ladder led up to a loft. Hiram had thrown his pack aside, and had tied Cubby to a peg in the log wall.|$|E

60|$|The {{secret was}} out, and I {{wondered}} no more. At once {{the stream and}} wet bars of sand took on a different color. I removed my boots, and waded out to a little bar.

I pushed my foot through the crust, and the cold, wet sand took hold, and tried to suck me down.|$|E
5000|$|Phillips has one {{daughter}} named Jadyn, who currently lives in Jamaica with her mother, {{who is a}} university employee. Phillips and Jadyn's mother are separated. Phillips is a devout Christian, himself stating that he devotes {{a considerable amount of}} time to prayer. He explained: [...] "I pray to God a lot. In the morning and at night before I go to bed. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> onto the pitch before a game, I stop before the sidelines, taking to the ground with my hands, before I do {{the sign of the cross}} and look up at the sky. Then I know that God will protect me during the game".|$|R

6000|$|She did {{not answer}} when I knocked; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> softly in the room I saw her in bed, asleep, with her work not half done, lying about the room in the untidiest way. There was nothing {{remarkable}} in that, and I was just going away on tiptoe, when a tiny bottle and wine-glass on the chair by her bedside caught my eye. I thought she was ill and had been taking physic, {{and looked at the}} bottle. It was marked in large letters, [...] "Laudanum--Poison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] {{said her}} husband, who {{had kept his}} bright eye observantly upon her, [...] "good day.

60|$|Well, I preached my sermon. And it fell horribly flat. I {{realized}} that, before I {{was half}} way through it. I think I preached it very well; and never a thump did I forget or misplace. But my audience was plainly bored. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{down from the}} pulpit, after demanding passionately if we whose souls were lighted and so forth, I felt with secret humiliation that my sermon was a failure. It had made no impression at all. Felix would {{be sure to get}} the prize.|$|E
5000|$|Kaepernick {{was baptized}} Methodist, {{confirmed}} Lutheran, and attended a Baptist church during his college years. Kaepernick spoke about his faith saying, [...] "My faith {{is the basis}} from where my game comes from. I've been very blessed to have the talent {{to play the game}} that I do and be successful at it. I think God guides me through every day and helps me take the right steps and has helped me to get to where I’m at. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> on the field, I always say a prayer, say I am thankful to be able to wake up that morning and go out there and try to glorify the Lord with what I do on the field. I think if you {{go out and try to}} do that, no matter what you do on the field, you can be happy about what you did." ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 30, 2014, it was {{announced}} by ABC News President Ben Sherwood that Elliott had {{signed a contract with}} NBC, and would depart ABC News and Good Morning America. Amy Robach {{was announced}} as his immediate replacement. With NBC, Elliott made $4 million per year, but a six-month non-compete clause prohibited him from appearing on news-related programming, relegating him primarily to NBC Sports programming such as the 2014 Kentucky Derby—where he made his on-air debut. Upon his hiring, it was believed that NBC was contemplating Elliott to serve as a future host of Today; in response, he told the press that he [...] "hoped Matt Lauer is here <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> away from this gig 30 years down the road. I {{can tell you that the}} only discussions I have had, as they relate to news, are ways to supply sports content to them." [...] Elliott would, eventually, serve as a sports correspondent for the program.|$|R
2500|$|Blackmun filed {{separate}} {{opinions in}} 1989's Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, warning that Roe was in jeopardy: [...] "I am 83 years old.

That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had been}} indebted to Maria {{for my first}} taste of Paradise. I was {{recalled}} by Maria {{to the world that}} I had been accustomed to live in; the world that was beginning to fade away in my memory already. She had been sent to the garden in search of me; and she had a word of advice to offer, after noticing my face <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out of the shadow of the tree: [...] "Try to look more like yourself, miss, before you let them see you at the tea-table." ...|$|E
6000|$|From {{the window}} of a law office, Emma and Matilda Leete were leaning and I decided to make myself known to them. Emma, who had been one of my high admirations, had {{developed}} into a handsome and interesting woman with very little of the village in her dress or expression, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> up to her and asked, [...] "Do you know me?" [...] her calm gray eyes and smiling lips denoted humor. [...] "Of course I know you--in spite of the beard. Come in and sit with us and tell all of us about yourself." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{films that}} I make are part documentary, part film essay, part visual poem. They are created {{out of a}} series of up to 30 {{drawings}} that are animated. The process from research to completion takes about 2 years, {{and at the end of}} it there is a film and a number of drawings that can be exhibited. This paper emerges out of the realisation that in the different stages of making a drawing and a film—from planning a drawing and seeking an image as a starting point through to the finished film being projected onto a screen in a gallery—I am looking at the image in different ways. There is a close-up kind of looking <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am drawing and a reflective kind of looking <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> back to take stock. There is a way of looking at darks and lights as they are built up that is different from the way of looking at the lines crossing the edges of the grid being used to transfer an image to the drawing paper. Seeing the drawings on the wall of my studio is different from seeing the same drawings in a museum setting...|$|R
