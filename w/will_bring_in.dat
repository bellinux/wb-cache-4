5|$|The World Cup {{was first}} {{televised}} in 1954 {{and is now}} the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event. It was predicted that Brazil <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> more than $11 billion in revenue for the 2014 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Smith, however, did not depart Texas immediately, and in September 1864 he {{captured}} the US schooner Florence Bearn {{at the mouth}} of the Rio Grande. In November 1864 he was in Havana where his presence was noted by Union officials, and where he detained by Spanish authorities for a time. He subsequently piloted the steamer Wren to Galveston through the Union blockade. In an April 1865 letter Magruder writes that Smith <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a valuable Confederate steamer probably in the next dark moon. On 20 June 1865 he reportedly left Texas with other notable Confederate figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} {{can be divided}} into 2 groups – the unorganized sector, which comprises traditional sweeteners manufacturers, and the organized sector, which consists of sugar factories. The producers of traditional sweeteners are considered {{to be a part of}} the rural industry and they manufacture khandsari and gur. These are consumed mainly by the rural people and are produced in substantial quantities. The total production of sugar in Bihar Sugar Industry was 4.21 lakh tons in 2002-2003 and in 2003-2004, the figure stood at 2.77 lakh tons. Again, in 2004-2005, the figure was 2.77 lakh tons. The state government, in order to boost the Sugar Industry in Bihar has decided to privatize the state-run sugar mills that have not worked for many years. The state government has also approved the proposal for the setting up of 15 new sugar mills in the state which <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> an investment of Rs. 3,771 crore in Bihar Sugar Industry.|$|E

Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Say Aah" [...] was one of the [...] "popping tracks" [...] which parent album Ready was built around. Commenting on the song's lyrics, Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy stated that, [...] "Its over-abundance of hooks ('we don't buyyyy no drinks at the bar' being a personal favorite) makes it pretty hard to dislike. And the verse from Brooklyn's Fabolous <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> even the most hardened of fun-haters."

500|$|Ray Perkins {{replaced}} Leeman Bennett as {{the third}} head coach in Buccaneers history. Expectations had been that owner Hugh Culverhouse would hire popular ex-Tampa Bay Bandits coach Steve Spurrier, but Perkins was the only candidate interviewed. Perkins had been approached about the job two years earlier, but was not interested at the time. He was given the same title (Head Coach and Vice-President of Football Operations) as the previous two coaches. He brought along seven of his Alabama assistants: linebackers coach Sylvester Croom, assistant coach John Bobo, running backs coach Rodney Stokes, defensive line coach Mike DuBose, strength coach Kent Johnston, head trainer Chris Smith, and defensive coordinator Joe Kines, who had previously been Charley Pell's defensive coordinator with the Florida Gators. He rounded out his staff with Kansas City Chiefs secondary coach Doug Graber and receivers coach Richard Williamson, Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Herb Paterra, SMU defensive coordinator Bill Clay, and Atlanta Falcons offensive line coach Larry Beightol. Perkins also overhauled the scouting staff, firing most of them (including Jim Gruden, father of future Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden) shortly after the draft. No reason was given, but some observers, most outspokenly Boston Globe columnist Will McDonough, felt that the Buccaneers' office was staffed heavily with people whose main experience was in college football, and that the team suffered {{from a lack of}} NFL knowledge. Recently fired Falcons coach Dan Henning turned down the offensive coordinator position, as he had been trying to rebuild the Falcons {{and did not want to}} relive that experience with another team. Perkins had previously been hired as head coach of the New York Giants on the basis of his experience working with a losing franchise (the New England Patriots) that needed turning around. Perkins coached the Giants back to the playoffs, leaving four years later to succeed coaching legend Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. Ironically, irritation over the 1982 players' strike was a major factor in Perkins' leaving the Giants, and became an issue he had to contend with again in 1987. Frustration with what he saw as overregulation by the NCAA played a part in Perkins' decision to return to the NFL. Along with $750,000 a year for five years, Perkins was given free rein to run the Buccaneers however he wanted. Some players were enthusiastic about the Perkins hire. [...] "Coach Perkins <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a sense of pride here, and that's something we've been missing", said tackle Ron Heller. Others were upset with Perkins' military-style manner, saying that he [...] "made playing football a miserable experience".|$|E
