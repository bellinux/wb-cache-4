5|$|As a child, Modi {{helped his}} father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and later ran a tea stall {{with his brother}} near a bus terminus. Modi {{completed}} his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in theatre. Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and this was noted by his teachers and students. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{enjoyed a}} series of prestigious fellowships after graduation. He was awarded a National Research Council, and then a Bartol Research Foundation fellowship.

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E

He 'combined colouristic skill <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in detailed scenes from history'.Bonaparte Crossing the Alps, which was painted roughly eight years before Delaroche's death, exemplifies this phase in Delaroche's career.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited until some time before 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E

5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of BYU studies, BYU Studies was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted {{and members of the}} Mormon History Association submitted papers to Dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Henry Moore {{was born}} in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale {{colliery}} in Castleford. He was an autodidact <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have {{decided to become a}} sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, James Alexander Holden {{emigrated to}} South Australia from Walsall, England and in 1856 {{established}} J.A. Holden & Co, a saddlery business in Adelaide. In 1885, German-born H. A. Frost joined the {{business as a}} junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd. Edward Holden, James' grandson, joined the firm in 1905 <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in automobiles. From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden & Frost moved {{into the business of}} minor repairs to car upholstery. The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages. After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden founded a new company in 1919, Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd (HMBB) specialising in car bodies and using a facility on King William Street in Adelaide.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Bute {{asked his}} chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to {{excavate}} and clear the castle ruins. The {{report on the}} investigations was produced by William Burges, an architect <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s, {{and the two men}} became close collaborators. Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. On receipt of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills {{and his family had}} left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> in {{theosophy}} and Biblical prophecy. The two {{quickly became}} close friends; he later recalled {{that he felt}} like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
