5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is {{more expensive than the}} standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher <b>welding</b> <b>speed</b> and greater metal penetration.|$|E
5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the <b>welding</b> <b>speed.</b> Flat welds require the least operator skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E
5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high <b>welding</b> <b>speed,</b> and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E
40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) model was developed for the analysis and simulation of {{the correlation between the}} friction stir welding (FSW) parameters of aluminum (Al) plates and mechanical properties. The input parameters of the model consist of <b>weld</b> <b>speed</b> (Ws) and tool rotation speed (Rs). The outputs of the ANN model include property parameters namely: tensile strength, yield strength and elongation. Good performance of the ANN model was achieved. The model can be used to calculate mechanical properties of welded Al plates as functions of <b>weld</b> <b>speed</b> and Rs. The combined influence of <b>weld</b> <b>speed</b> and Rs on the mechanical properties of welded Al plates was simulated. Simulated annealing technique was used to prevent the network from getting stuck in local minima. A comparison was made between measured and calculated data. The calculated results were in good agreement with measured data...|$|R
40|$|For {{increase}} productivity, {{the current}} technology of welding pipes bellows {{was replaced by}} laser welding. Experiment was carried out on the material of austenitic stainless steel 1. 4541 for sheet thickness 0. 25 mm and 0. 15 mm. On sheet 0. 25 mm was achieved comparable mechanical properties as the current manufacturing process upon achieving 10 times higher <b>welding</b> <b>speeds.</b> Samples of 0. 15 mm thickness achieved to about 30 % lower deepening over existing technology. For improvement was advised to reduce heat input. From an economic assessment shows that the price per 1 m of weld decreases with increasing <b>speed</b> <b>welding.</b> With higher <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> reduces the heat input...|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of voids in the weld {{is a common}} defect in friction-stir welds. The fluid dynamics associated with plastic flow in the weld nugget {{plays a key role}} in the formation of such voids. Although high <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> promote more economical friction-stir welds and higher productivity, too high <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> lead to the formation of voids beneath the top surface of the weld or on the advancing side at the edge of the weld nugget. Further increase in speed leads to the formation of bigger wormhole defects (Crawford et al. 2006).|$|R
5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the <b>welding</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase <b>welding</b> <b>speed.</b> Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing <b>welding</b> <b>speed,</b> increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
50|$|A defocused beam {{does not}} penetrate, and the {{material}} at low <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> is heated only by conduction of {{the heat from the}} surface, producing a hemispherical melted zone.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCopper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} metals of modern times. The extensive usage from thin foils up to thick plates leads to a huge amount of welding applications. Basically the Laser Beam Welding is suited well for the welding of copper, because difficulties such as the high thermal conductivity can be overcome by high intensities. However in industrial applications, a sufficient process capability is currently only achieved at high <b>welding</b> <b>speeds.</b> This leads to low penetration depths and high demands in terms of laser power. At low <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>weld</b> metal ejections, which cause critical defects occur. By Laser Beam Welding in Vacuum (LaVa) the process capability can be increased significantly. Weld metal ejections at low <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> can be prevented. By applying this process variation, high quality welding of copper at a low power level between 4 kW and 8 kW and a low intensity level between 50 kW/mm 2 and 80 kW/mm 2 of a multimode solid state laser becomes possible for penetration depths of 3 to 8 mm...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of friction stir welding process vs. welding parameters was evaluated and analysed in detail. To this purpose, butt joints in AA 5754 aluminum alloy sheets were obtained at different rotational and <b>welding</b> <b>speeds.</b> All input and output data, in terms of materials, energies and emissions, were collected and analyzed using a life cycle assessment software in order to evaluate the {{environmental impact}} index. Sound weld was used as functional unit and all energy and material flows were based on it.

5|$|Shielding gas {{mixtures}} {{of three or}} more gases are also available. Mixtures of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels. Other mixtures add {{a small amount of}} helium to argon-oxygen combinations, these mixtures are claimed to allow higher arc voltages and <b>welding</b> <b>speed.</b> Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argonwhich is denser than air. It also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the <b>welding</b> <b>speed</b> diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and <b>welding</b> <b>speed.</b> Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a {{semi-automatic}} or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Since the electrode is continuous, <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.|$|R

Also, increase in the tool rotational <b>speed</b> under constant <b>weld</b> <b>speed</b> increases the heat input while increase in the <b>weld</b> <b>speed</b> under constant tool rotational speed decreases the heat input and the rate of heat generation at the shoulder in a flat shoulder tool is more than that of conical/tapered shoulder tool.

25|$|There are two tool speeds to be {{considered}} in friction-stir welding; how fast the tool rotates and how quickly it traverses along the interface. These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the <b>welding</b> <b>speed</b> and the heat input during welding is complex but, in general, {{it can be said that}} increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.|$|E

500|$|Alternating {{current is}} rarely used with GMAW; instead, direct current is {{employed}} and the electrode is generally positively charged.

40|$|When welding {{large copper}} parts, {{the process is}} {{strongly}} limited by the high thermal conductivity and capacity {{as well as the}} high temperature strength of copper. These slow down the welding process and require a large heat input. By this the process forces are high and probe failure is a severe issue. Typical <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> of thick copper plates today are around 50 to 150 mm/min under laboratory like conditions, requiring a spindle torque up to 1000 Nm, excluding usual multipurpose FSW-machines from this application.

The process is carried out on a multipurpose machine reaching <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> up to 500 mm/min in 20 mm rolled Cu-OF.

500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. [...] Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high <b>welding</b> <b>speed,</b> can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
500|$|The {{selection}} of a shielding gas depends on several factors, including the type of material being welded, joint design, and desired final weld appearance. [...] Argon is {{the most commonly used}} shielding gas for GTAW, since it helps prevent defects due to a varying arc length. When used with alternating current, argon shielding results in high weld quality and good appearance. Another common shielding gas, helium, is most often used to increase the weld penetration in a joint, to increase the <b>welding</b> <b>speed,</b> and to weld metals with high heat conductivity, such as copper and aluminum. A significant disadvantage is the difficulty of striking an arc with helium gas, and the decreased weld quality associated with a varying arc length.|$|E
500|$|In the pulsed-current mode, {{the welding}} current rapidly {{alternates}} between two levels. [...] The higher current state {{is known as}} the pulse current, while the lower current level is called the background current. [...] During the period of pulse current, the weld area is heated and fusion occurs. [...] Upon dropping to the background current, the weld area is allowed to cool and solidify. [...] Pulsed-current GTAW has a number of advantages, including lower heat input and consequently a reduction in distortion and warpage in thin workpieces. [...] In addition, it allows for greater control of the weld pool, and can increase weld penetration, <b>welding</b> <b>speed,</b> and quality. [...] A similar method, manual programmed GTAW, allows the operator to program a specific rate and magnitude of current variations, making it useful for specialized applications.|$|E

30|$|Innovations {{in power}} source {{technology}} for {{laser beam welding}} are expanding the range of suitable applications. The availability of higher power lasers and higher power densities has enabled the formation of stable keyholes and improved beam qualities and have mitigated problems related to high surface reflectivity and high thermal conductivity. As {{a result of these}} developments, both CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers can now be used {{for a wide variety of}} aluminium alloys. Shorter wavelengths mean a slight advantage in <b>welding</b> <b>speeds</b> for Nd:YAG lasers compared to similar power CO 2 lasers. Two types of porosity occur in laser welding of aluminium alloys: metallurgical porosity and keyhole porosity. Keyhole instability is the main cause of bubble initiation especially in deep penetration welding; however, this can be reduced by using effective welding parameters and vacuum conditions. Metallurgical porosity mainly occurs due to the presence of hydrogen in the weld pool; therefore, to reduce hydrogen porosity, increased <b>weld</b> <b>speed</b> should be used, which results in insufficient time for hydrogen to accumulate due to rapid cooling and solidification.|$|R
