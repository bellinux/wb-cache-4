25|$|Between the 1954–55 and 1970–71 seasons, {{thirteen}} East Pakistan first-class cricket teams {{played in}} Pakistan's domestic cricket competitions, the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy and the Ayub Trophy. Many played {{in only a}} single season or two. The most prolific were East Pakistan (nine seasons), Dacca University (four), East Pakistan Greens and East Pakistan Whites (three each). Chittagong {{is a good example}} of the sporadic way in which teams from East Pakistan were involved in the national competitions as they were scheduled to play three matches between 1959–60 and 1965–66 and all were abandoned <b>without</b> <b>play</b> starting. The main East Pakistan team played first-class matches against the touring Indians in 1954–55 and Marylebone Cricket Club in 1955–56.|$|E

2500|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Spurrier {{returned to}} the college game in 1978 as an offensive assistant at Florida under head coach Doug Dickey. Dickey and his entire staff were fired after the season, and Spurrier served as the quarterbacks coach at Georgia Tech in 1979 under head coach Pepper Rodgers, who was also fired after the season. At his first two coaching stops, Spurrier had been primarily a position coach <b>without</b> <b>play</b> calling responsibilities. In 1980, Duke University head coach Red Wilson hired Spurrier as his offensive coordinator. His squads were seldom as talented as their opposition, so Spurrier created an innovative pass-based offensive system that broke several school and conference records over his three seasons as an assistant at the school. When asked in later years how he developed his offense, Spurrier has often stated that he [...] "learned it all at Duke University." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} {{reproduced}} {{the full text}} of Letters in the proportion customary in English biography. The existing mass of his letters is enormous. But then an enormous proportion of them touch on affairs of public business, on which they shed little new light. Even when he writes in his kindest and most cordial vein to friends to whom he is most warmly attached, it is usually a letter of business. He deals freely and genially with the points in hand, and then <b>without</b> <b>play</b> of gossip, salutation, or compliment, he passes on his way. He has in his letters little of that spirit in which his talk often abounded, of disengagement, pleasant colloquy, happy raillery, and all the other undefined things that make the correspondence of so many men whose business was literature, such delightful reading for the idler hour of an industrious day. It is perhaps worth adding that the asterisks denoting an omitted passage hide no piquant hit, no personality, no indiscretion; the omission is in every case due to consideration of space. Without these asterisks and, other omissions, nothing would have been easier than to expand these three volumes into a hundred. I think nothing relevant is lost. Nobody ever had fewer secrets, nobody ever lived and wrought in fuller sunlight.|$|E
