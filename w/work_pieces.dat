DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for partial forming of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> for interior high pressure form, comprises carrying out the forming process via a tool though which a discharge geometry of the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is approximated in a sub region of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section of the interior high pressure form to create <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> geometries.

The <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section is changed in different radial levels, which are spaced apart from each other in direction of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> axis. The tool has a pressing roll (5) with a surface section (4) and the pressing roll is subjected with a force in such a manner that the surface section with the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is brought into unit to transform the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> in a partially transforming step. The pressing roll and the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> are moved relatively to each other. The surface section of the pressing roll has multi regions of different geometry, by which a definite region is brought into the unit with the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> by swiveling the pressing roll around a swivel axis (8).

In materials having high thermal conductivity, like aluminium alloys, large amount of this heat is absorbed by the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> This results in the rise in the temperature of the <b>work</b> <b>piece,</b> which may lead to dimensional inaccuracies, surface damage and deformation. So, it is needed to control rise in the temperature of the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> This paper focuses on the measurement, analysis and prediction of <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> temperature rise during the dry end milling operation of Al 6063. The control factors used for experimentation were number of flutes, spindle speed, depth of cut and feed rate. The Taguchi method was employed for the planning of experimentation and L 18 orthogonal array was selected. The temperature rise of the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> was measured with the help of K-type thermocouple embedded in the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> Signal to noise (S/N) ratio analysis was carried out using the lower-the-better quality characteristics.

50|$|The basic {{plasma cutting}} process {{involves}} creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the plasma cutter itself, through the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit {{back to the}} plasma cutter via a grounding clamp.

The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|R
