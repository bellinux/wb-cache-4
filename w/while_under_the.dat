5|$|Cochrane was {{transferred}} to the North America and West Indies station in November 1917, but rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron early in 1918. She was based in Murmansk between March and September 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She ferried Soviet troops to Pechenga on 3 May to forestall an attempt by White Finns to seize the town. On 14 November 1918 she was stranded in the Mersey Estuary, <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of the pilot, and later broke in two, becoming a total loss. The wreck had been broken up in situ by June 1919.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Koldun {{began on}} 9 November 1863 by the Belgian firm of Cockerill for {{assembly}} in Saint Petersburg.

5|$|Following the Mexican–American War, Washington {{traveled}} to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush and authored the novel, A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence. Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained {{for a few}} years and fought as a Border Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. <b>While</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> command of Captain Henry Clay Pate, Washington was present at the June 1856 Free-Stater attack known as Battle of Black Jack, where he sustained minor injuries. Washington died by drowning after falling overboard from a steamboat on the Missouri River in September 1856. His family's descendants claim Washington was murdered by Jayhawkers.|$|E
5|$|Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest {{toward the}} North Carolina-South Carolina border {{over the next}} two days, it slowly strengthened, {{acquiring}} more tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before turning toward the north and brushing Cape Hatteras, then accelerating toward the northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the intensification of Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E

Immediately after this, Lukačević and his Chetniks participated {{in one of}} the largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, Case White, where they fought alongside Italian, German and Croatian (NDH) troops. The following November, Lukačević concluded a formal collaboration agreement with the Germans and participated in a further anti-Partisan offensive, Operation Kugelblitz.|$|E

In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities {{to the story of}} The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E

5|$|Aediles were {{officers}} {{elected to}} conduct domestic affairs in Rome, and often assisted the higher magistrates. The office {{was not on}} the cursus honorum, and therefore did not mark the beginning of a political career. Every year, two curule aediles and two plebeian aediles were elected. The Tribal Assembly, <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> presidency of a higher magistrate (either a consul or praetor), elected the two curule aediles. While they had a curule chair, they did not have lictors, and thus they had no power of coercion. The Plebeian Council (principal popular assembly), under the presidency of a plebeian tribune, elected the two plebeian aediles. Aediles had wide-ranging powers over day-to-day affairs inside the city of Rome, and over the maintenance of public order. They had the power over public games and shows, and over the markets. They also had the power to repair and preserve temples, sewers and aqueducts, to maintain public records, and to issue edicts. Any expenditure of public funds, by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile, had to be authorized by the senate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the assault}} {{is known to}} popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett {{was one of his}} {{division}}al commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault (or, less frequently, Longstreet's Assault) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 730, al-Jarrah {{returned}} to the offensive through Tiflis and the Darial Pass. Arab sources report that he reached {{as far as the}} Khazar capital, al-Bayda, on the Volga, but modern historians such as Khalid Yahya Blankinship consider this improbable. Soon after, he was forced back to Bardha'a to defend Arran from invasion by the Khazar general Tharmach. It is unclear whether the Khazars moved through the Darial Pass or the Caspian Gates, but they succeeded in outmanoeuvring al-Jarrah, bypassing the Arab forces and laying siege to Ardabil, the capital of Adharbayjan, where 30,000 Muslim troops and their families were gathered. News of this development forced al-Jarrah to hastily withdraw from Bardha'a and march south in a rapid march to Ardabil's rescue. Outside the city walls, after a three-day battle on 7–9 December 730, al-Jarrah's army of 25,000 was all but annihilated by the Khazars under Barjik, with al-Jarrah himself falling in the field. Command passed to al-Jarrah's brother al-Hajjaj, who was unable to prevent the sacking of Ardabil, or to check Khazar raids that reached as far as south as Mosul. The experienced general Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi was put in command and soon succeeded in driving back the invasion, <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> leadership of Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future Marwan II) the war was concluded in a nominal Arab victory in 737.|$|E

5|$|Kyra {{decides to}} {{reconnect}} with the other Halliwell sisters and devote her life to doing good. She begins by helping the newly resurrected Benjamin Turner, the father of Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), readjust to his new life. As they spend more time together, Kyra {{falls in love with}} Benjamin and they begin a romantic relationship. At the end of issue #18 ("Tribunal and Tribulations"), Prue kidnaps Kyra, along with Benjamin and the archai (a magical being capable of opening portals through reality) Tyler Michaels. Kyra witnesses Prue perform a sacrificial ritual forcing Tyler to open portals in the sky that provide the Old Ones with access into the world. Kyra, Benjamin, and Tyler are later rescued by Paige. Following Prue's death and the closure of the portals, Kyra initially plans to leave, but Ben convinces her to help the students of Knox Academy, a school for magic. Prue, <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of the Old One Heremus, had previously attacked the campus and turned the students and faculty into hosts for demons.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously {{infected}} with boils and, <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{care of a}} Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before {{the end of the}} year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a peptic ulcer. At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, until she was ten years old. Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay.|$|E
5|$|SM U-5 {{was laid}} down in April 1907 and {{launched}} in February 1909. She was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in April 1910, {{and served as a}} training boat—sometimes making as many as ten cruises a month—through the beginning of the First World War in 1914. The submarine scored most of her wartime successes {{during the first year of}} the war <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> command of Georg Ritter von Trapp. The French armoured cruiser Léon Gambetta, sunk in April 1915, was the largest ship sunk by U-5. In May 1917, U-5 hit a mine and sank with the loss of six men. She was raised, rebuilt, and recommissioned, but sank no more ships. At the end of the war, U-5 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation, and scrapped in 1920. In all, U-5 sank four ships totaling 21,604 tons.|$|E

5|$|The power {{struggle}} in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power {{at the expense of}} the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. <b>While,</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{north and}} {{northeast}} <b>while</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{influence of the}} aforementioned trough, Marty began to weaken soon after peak intensity as deep convection was displaced to the east due to the strong westerly shear; the low-level circulation center became fully exposed in a span of three hours late on September28. Upwelling of cooler waters further decayed the deep convection, prompting the NHC to downgrade Marty to a tropical storm at 06:00UTC (1a.m.CDT) on September29. Continuing to steadily weaken, Marty degenerated into a post-tropical low a day later about 140mi (225km) west-southwest of Acapulco, while still producing gale-force winds. The shallow system turned westwards in the low-level flow and eventually opened up into a trough twelve hours later about 195mi (315km) west of Acapulco. The low became closed once again on October1, however, it failed to produce sufficient organized deep convection to re-qualify as a tropical cyclone. It turned north-northeastwards towards the southern Gulf of California, however it dissipated before reaching the coast of Western Mexico. The remnant moisture continued into Northwestern Mexico and caused flooding in Sonora.|$|E
