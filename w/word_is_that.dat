500|$|Psychotronic {{movie is}} a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon—referred to by a fellow critic as [...] "the {{historian}} of marginal movies"—to denote the sort of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment. Weldon's immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film The Psychotronic Man (1980), whose title character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy. According to Weldon, [...] "My original idea with that <b>word</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's a two-part word. 'Psycho' stands for the horror movies, and 'tronic' stands for the science fiction movies. I very quickly expanded {{the meaning of the}} word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie." [...] The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon's such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film and Psychotronic Video magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans. Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp.|$|E
2500|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that conubium existed only between a civis Romanus and a civis Romana (that is, between a male Roman citizen {{and a female}} Roman citizen), so that a {{marriage}} between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases). Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, [...] "matrimonium was then an institution involving a mother, mater. The idea implicit in the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a man took a woman in marriage, in matrimonium ducere, {{so that he might}} have children by her." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the letter}} to the Corinthians, within the list of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: malakoi and arsenokoitai. Malakoi is a common Greek word meaning, of things subject to touch, [...] "soft" [...] (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to {{describe}} a garment); of things not subject to touch, [...] "gentle"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include [...] "pathic". Nowhere else in scripture is Malakoi used to describe a person. Bishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a [...] "soft" [...] or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or [...] "those who abuse themselves"; all we actually, factually, know about the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it means soft.|$|E

2500|$|The Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility {{commenced}} {{an investigation}} into the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys. [...] Their report was issued in September 2008. [...] The report cited serious issues of accountability removing a few of the U.S. Attorneys, but there was no finding that the nine U.S. Attorneys were removed for illegal or improper reasons. [...] To the contrary, the report concluded that Margaret Chiara and Kevin Ryan were removed appropriately for management issues. [...] Paul Charlton was removed for his action relating to a death penalty case and unilateral implementation of an interrogation policy. [...] The report found Carol Lam was removed because of the Justice Department's concerns about the low number of gun and immigration prosecutions in her district. [...] The report concluded John McKay was asked to leave because of his disagreement with the Deputy Attorney General over an information-sharing program. [...] The report could not cite to a reason Dan Bogden was asked to leave, but there was no finding that anything illegal or improper occurred with his removal. [...] The report concluded Bud Cummins was asked to leave to make room for another political appointee that he himself conceded under oath was qualified to serve as a U.S. Attorney. [...] These findings were consistent with testimony given by Gonzales. [...] Politics was clearly involved. [...] Likewise, the report concluded Todd Graves was removed to settle a political dispute in Missouri. [...] Again, this was motivated by politics. [...] Finally, the report found that it could not conclude that David Iglesias was removed for an improper reason. [...] However, since the IG had no authority to investigate Congress or the White House, the IG asked Attorney General Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Iglesias removal. This special prosecutor found no wrongdoing in the removal of David Iglesias. [...] The DOJ IG found no criminal wrongdoing in the records. [...] As the Wall Street Journal reported [...] "the Justice Department informed Congress on Wednesday that a special investigator in the case found no evidence of wrongdoing….the investigator's final <b>word</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no Administration official gave 'false statements' to Congress or to the DOJ Inspector General, which carried out their own investigation." [...] In particular, the report found no evidence that Gonzales made false or misleading statements to Congress, thus clearing him of accusations of perjury.|$|E

For the phantasies of dreams are wonderful, seeing {{that they have no}} stability, but vary like the vaporous edge of sunset clouds, {{building}} now this thing, and now that; being now dark and heavy, and now alight with splendour. Therefore, before we wake to-morrow tell me one <b>word.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> vision of last night, wherein I seemed to be quite shamed, and thou didst seem to laugh upon my shame, a fixed phantasy, or can it, perchance, yet change its countenance? For remember, when that waking comes, the vagaries of our sleep will be more unalterable and more enduring than are the pyramids. Then they will be gathered into that changeless region of the past where all things, great and small--ay, even dreams, Harmachis, are, each in its own semblance, frozen to stone and built into the Tomb of Time immortal." ...|$|E
6000|$|Don't imagine for {{a moment}} that I don't feel the full horror of my having had to wait till now, when I can avail myself of this aid, to acknowledge, as the poor pale pettifogging term has it, the receipt from you of inexpressibly splendid bounties. I won't attempt to explain or expatiate--about this abject failure of utterance: the idea of [...] "explaining" [...] {{anything}} to you in these days, or of any expatiation that isn't exclusively that of your own genius upon your own adventures and impressions! I think the reason why I have been so baffled, in a <b>word,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all my powers of being anything else have gone to living upon your two magnificent letters, the one from Verdun, and the one after your second visit there; which gave me matter of experience and appropriation to which I have done the fullest honour. Your whole record is sublime, and the interest and the beauty and the terror of it all have again and again called me back to it. I have ventured to share it, {{for the good of the}} cause and the glory of the connection (mine,) with two or three select others--this I candidly confess to you--one of whom was dear Howard, absolutely as dear as ever through everything, and whom I all but reduced to floods of tears, tears of understanding and sympathy. I know them at last, your incomparable pages, by heart--and thus it is really that I feel qualified to speak to you of them. With the two sublimities in question, or between them, came of course also the couple of other favours, enclosing me, pressing back upon me, my attempted contribution to your Paris labour: to which perversity I have had to bow my head. I was very sorry to be so forced, but even while cursing and gnashing my teeth I got your post-office order cashed, and the money is, God knows, assistingly spendable here! Another pang was your mention of Jean du Breuil's death.... I didn't know him, had never seen him; but your account of the admirable manner of his end makes one feel that one would like even to have just beheld him. We are in the midst, the very midst, of histories of that sort, miserable and terrible, here too; the Neuve Chapelle business, from a strange, in the sense of being a pretty false, glamour at first flung about which we are gradually recovering, seems to have taken a hideous toll of officers, and other distressing legends (legends of mistake and confusion) are somehow overgrowing it too. But painful particulars are not what I want to give you--of anything; you are up to your neck in your own, and I had much rather pick my steps to the clear places, so far as there be any such! I continue to try and keep my own existence one, so far as I may--a place clear of the last accablement, I mean: apparently what it comes to is that it's [...] "full up" [...] with the last but one.|$|E
