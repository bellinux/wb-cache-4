5000|$|The term [...] "complex" [...] (Komplex; also [...] "emotionally charged complexes" [...] or [...] "feeling-toned {{complex of}} ideas"), {{was adopted by}} Carl Jung {{when he was still}} a close {{associate}} of Sigmund Freud. Complexes were so central to Jung's ideas that he originally called his body of theories [...] "Complex psychology". [...] Historically the term originated with Theodor Ziehen, a German psychiatrist who experimented with reaction time in <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>test</b> responses. Jung described a [...] "complex" [...] as a 'node' in the unconscious; it may be imagined as a knot of unconscious feelings and beliefs, detectable indirectly, through behavior that is puzzling or hard to account for.|$|E

50|$|Like Freud, Bleuler {{believed}} that complex mental processes could be unconscious. He encouraged his {{staff at the}} Burghölzli to study unconscious and psychotic mental phenomena. Influenced by Bleuler, Carl Jung and Franz Riklin used <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>tests</b> to integrate Freud's theory of repression with empirical psychological findings. As a series of letters demonstrates (published in English in 2003), Bleuler performed a self-analysis with Freud, beginning in 1905.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} observed that individuals high in promotion-focus {{are more likely}} to show flexible and creative thinking patterns. Therefore, researchers believed that situations that activate promotion-focus should result in greater creativity. It was found that those who put a high emphasis on social obligation had less desire to be creative, and therefore manipulation of the salience of ought self-guides inhibited creative output while manipulation of ideal self-guides increased creative output. Furthermore, priming of promotion-focus lead subjects led to more novel answers on a <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>test.</b> However, it is believed that these results came from an increase in creative expression, not creative ability, as the boost to creative output vanished among speeded trials.|$|E

50|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus is {{generally}} credited with developing {{the first sentence}} completion test in 1897. Ebbinghaus's sentence completion test was used {{as part of an}} intelligence test. Simultaneously, Carl Jung's <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>test</b> may also have been a precursor to modern sentence completion tests. Moreover, in recent decades, sentence completion tests have increased in usage, in part because they are easy to develop and easy to administer. As of the 1980s, sentence completion tests were the eighty-fifth most widely used personality assessment instruments. Another reason for the increased usage of sentence completion tests is because of their superiority to other measures in uncovering conflicted attitudes. Some sentence completion tests were developed as a way to overcome the problems associated with thematic apperception measures of the same constructs.|$|E
40|$|Data from Shavelson’s (1972) study {{investigating}} {{the change in}} cognitive structure due to instruction in Newtonian mechanics were reanalyzed using the quadratic assignment (QA) approach.

The proximity matrices in Shavelson’s study were obtained from multiple-response <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>tests</b> at a pretest {{and at the end}} of each day of a 5 -day instructional sequence. The Euclidean distance measure Shavelson used to evaluate change toward a representation of the instructional content, however, did not measure structural change in the proximity matrices for cognitive structure. The present reanalysis using the QA paradigm showed that cognitive structure after instruction was similar to content structure before instruction, and <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>tests</b> did not measure any subtle changes toward greater similarity to content structure. However, the QA results provided some evidence for Shavelson’s contention that the experimental group’s cognitive structure changed toward greater homogeneity later in instruction...|$|R

50|$|Jung found {{evidence}} for complexes {{very early in}} his career in the word association tests conducted at the Burghölzli, the psychiatric clinic of Zurich University, where Jung worked from 1900-1908. Jung developed the theory out of his work on <b>Word</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Test.</b> In the word association tests, a researcher read a list of 100 words to each subject, who was asked to say, as quickly as possible, the first thing that came to mind in response to each word, and the subject's reaction time was measured in fifths of a second. (Sir Francis Galton invented the method in 1879.) Researchers noted any unusual reactions—hesitations, slips of the tongue, signs of emotion. Jung was interested in patterns he detected in subjects' responses, hinting at unconscious feelings and beliefs.|$|E
50|$|The {{sentence}} completion {{method of}} studying personality is a semi structured projective technique {{in which the}} subject is asked to finish a sentence for which the first word or words are supplied. As in other projective devices, {{it is assumed that}} the subject reflects his own wishes, desires, fears and attitudes in the sentences he makes. Historically, the incomplete sentence method is related most closely to the <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>test.</b> In some test incomplete sentences tests only a single word or brief response is called for; the major differences appears to be in the length of the stimulus. In the sentence completion tests, tendencies to block and to twist the meaning of the stimulus words appear and the responses may be categorized in a somewhat similar fashion to the word association method.|$|E

5000|$|Verbal fluency {{tests are}} {{a kind of}} {{psychological}} test in which participants have to produce as many words as possible from a category in a given time (usually 60 seconds).

The COWAT (Controlled oral <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>test)</b> is the most employed phonetic variant.

25|$|Following {{the sudden}} {{death of her}} only sister Emilia from typhoid, Spielrein's mental health started to deteriorate, and at the age of 18 she {{suffered}} a breakdown with severe hysteria including tics, grimaces, and uncontrollable laughing and crying. After an unsuccessful stay in a Swiss sanatorium, where she developed another infatuation with one of the doctors, she was admitted to the Burghölzli mental hospital near Zurich in August 1904. Its director was Eugen Bleuler, who ran it as a therapeutic community with social activities for the patients including gardening, drama and scientific lectures. One of Bleuler's assistants was Carl Jung, afterwards appointed as deputy director. In the days following her admission, Spielrein disclosed to Jung that her father had often beaten her, and that she was troubled by masochistic fantasies of being beaten. Bleuler ensured that she was separated from her family, later requiring her father and brothers to have no contact with her. She made a rapid recovery, and by October was able to apply for medical school and to start assisting Jung with <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>tests</b> in his laboratory. Between October and January, Jung carried out <b>word</b> <b>association</b> <b>tests</b> on her, and also used some rudimentary psychoanalytic techniques. Later, he referred to her twice in letters to Freud as his first analytic case, although in his publications he referred to two later patients in these terms. During her admission, Spielrein fell in love with Jung. By her own choice, she continued as a resident in the hospital from January to June 1905, although she was no longer receiving treatment. She worked as an intern alongside other Russian students there including Max Eitingon, as well as expatriate psychiatrists who were studying with Bleuler, including Karl Abraham.|$|R
