I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that.

You just <b>want</b> <b>those</b> things, you want to see those things, it's part of updating it." ...|$|E
500|$|The reviews {{have stood}} the test of time and the season still remains a huge {{critical}} favorite. Entertainment Weekly reviewing the tenth season of the show acknowledged that, [...] "the second season is still the show’s best season to date." [...] The site added, [...] "I do want to talk about what season 10 could learn from what I believe is the show’s best season to date: season 2." [...] calling in all the signature elements of the show that it did the best with listing all the best moments from the season, [...] "the elevator", [...] "the walkway", [...] "Joe’s bar, [...] " [...] Meredith’s [...] "Pick me" [...] speech". and the [...] "memorable patients" [...] adding, [...] " [...] I want two people stuck on a pole (Into You Like a Train) or two Amish best friends having to say goodbye, and I <b>want</b> <b>those</b> stories to be given ample time to resonate. More than anything, I want them to affect our doctors in heartbreaking and beautiful ways." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I <b>want</b> <b>those</b> songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. [...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes. I made it clear that I did not <b>want</b> <b>those</b> scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't <b>want</b> <b>those</b> musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E

500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not <b>want</b> <b>those</b> polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

They <b>wanted</b> <b>those</b> that were convicted of killing Malcolm X. They also wanted to receive visits from Warith Deen Mohammed and champion boxer Muhammad Ali, long an active Black Muslim supporter. Khaalis also demanded that he be refunded $750 in legal fees caused by a contempt of court citation issued in response to shouting at one of defendants on trial for murdering 7 of his family members. Time noted: [...] "He also wanted the recently released film Mohammad, Messenger of God, to be banned {{on the grounds that}} it is sacrilegious. Khaalis' concern over the film was thought to have triggered the attack." [...] He made this determination about the sacrilegious nature of the film based on the mistaken impression that Mohammad was a character seen or heard in the film, which is not the case. The main characters are relatives whose portrayal is not forbidden by religious tradition.|$|R

2500|$|The album {{contained}} several {{tracks that}} seemed to indirectly reference what the group called [...] "The Incident", and the group remained defiant. Maguire commented that, [...] "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with Reba McEntire and Toby Keith. We don't <b>want</b> <b>those</b> kinds of fans. They limit what you can do."

5000|$|Both series {{consistently}} {{topped the}} channel's ratings with {{an audience of}} over 250,000 per episode; however, it had a less favourable response from the critics.

The network's defense that the series was meant to appeal to undiscriminating viewers, particularly children and the elderly, only invited further criticism.|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, {{shortly before}} the Iraq War, Schäuble accused German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of [...] "strengthening Saddam Hussein" [...] by {{undermining}} the unanimity of international pressure on Iraq {{to open up to}} United Nations weapons inspectors. On Schröder's initiative to join forces with President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir Putin of Russia in opposing the war, Schäuble commented: [...] "This triangular relationship involving Berlin, Paris and Moscow was a dangerous development. It was very dangerous for the small countries in Europe because they perceived it as an axis and you can understand why. We want good relations with Russia but we do not <b>want</b> <b>those</b> relations to be misunderstood." [...] Schäuble, in contrast to many German politicians, subsequently defended the United States' decision to invade Iraq. By 2006, he said he thought the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was in itself correct, but that he was [...] "doubtful" [...] from the outset about the Iraq war because it resulted from a unilateral decision by the US.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley's {{resentment of}} Allen stands in marked {{contrast}} to that of Patton, the U.S. Seventh Army commander in Sicily. Although Patton and Allen frequently argued and even insulted each other, particularly when discussing tactics and leadership styles, the former recognized Allen's competence in building a fighting division. When Patton heard General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, deliver a lecture on the 'poor discipline' of Allen's 1st Division, Patton contradicted him: [...] "I told him he was mistaken and that anyhow no one whips a dog before putting him into a fight." [...] Nor did personalities dissuade Patton from fighting to get the 1st Infantry Division to carry out the Gela landings in Sicily, which he had correctly surmised would be the most difficult of the Allied assault landings in Sicily. When Patton learned that the 36th Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Fred Walker (whom Allen had served under as ADC during his time with the division), was to be used instead at Gela, he protested to General Eisenhower, claiming [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>those</b> [...] sons of bitches. I won't go without them!" [...] Patton got his way.|$|E
