40|$|Denmark {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} countries in biogas technology. This country added several improvements to the biogas process in order to increase the biogas yield and thereby improve the economical profitability. Consequently, this project studied the developments of biogas technology in Denmark. The study includes a historical progress of biogas plants since 1970 s; the different problems interrupted the expansion of this technology and the actions taken to overcome these obstacles. This research helps to expect the problems which may face the development of this technology in the future. Expecting future problems is important from the planning point of view; so as to advise treatment strategies if required. As well, this research could be as guidance for countries who want to develop and implement biogas technology. It will be useful to benefit from the Danish experience in this field. The investigations show that biogas plants in Denmark were well developed until 1998. Afterward, the construction of centralised biogas plants was completely stopped while the construction of farm-scale plants was continued. The total energy production from biogas plants in Denmark is 1. 4 PJ and just small amount of this energy 0. 2 PJ is produced from the farm-scale plants. The expansion of biogas technology in Denmark was slowed down in the last six years. Two reasons were behind this hindrance. The first is a change in the energy policy, where the new Danish government focus on efficient and economical energy supply rather than clean and environmental energy resources. The second reason is the limited availability of organic waste which is important factors to increase the biogas yield and improve the economic profitability of the process. However, a new agreement on renewable energy resources (wind power and biogas) has been posited in 29 th of March 2004. The agreement includes an increase of 30 % for research, development and demonstration of advanced renewable energy technologies. Most the technical problems of biogas process have been solved in the past. It is expected that biogas technology may face economical difficulties in the future. There were a decrease in investments grants for biogas plants and reduction in funding for R&D of renewable resources in the last few years. But the new political agreement (March 2004) provided biogas-price supplement for new biogas installations. The agreement includes a limit of 8 PJ for subsidy of existing and new biogas installations by 2008. Therefore, technical improvements in the biogas process are vital in order to improve the economic profitability of this technology. R&D in biogas field should continue until achieve a stage at which biogas plant can operate without investment grants after 2008. This study proposed new strategies and solutions to overcome the current and the expected future problems of biogas technology. These includes selling the biogas technology, create pressure on government to increase the funding for R&D in biogas, utilising organic waste from household and positing fees for the treatment of manure in biogas plants. The aim is to increase the funding for development in biogas field and to find an appropriate solution for organic <b>waste</b> <b>limitation.</b> In additions, the report contains comments and suggestions to improve the cost benefit analysis of centralised biogas plants. More advantages and disadvantages of biogas process can be added to the socio-economical analysis in order to improve its reliability...|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{is one of}} the raw {{materials}} for product manufacturing. Due to its advantageous including flexibility, relatively low cost and flexibility, it is widely applied {{in a wide range of}} products, such as shopping bags, containers, electronic equipment cases, etc. As plastic products are usually in short-term use, in proportion, a huge amount of plastic waste generates in the world every day, the same case happens in Hong Kong. Landfill expansion in the coming years is a hot social and environmental issue in Hong Kong. Plastic waste, which is a recyclable material, is the second highest component of municipal solid waste (MSW) being disposed into the landfill by weight in 2013. Plastic recycling business is facing difficulties in high operating cost and low revenue of recycled plastic pellets due to the dropping of oil price in recent years. Besides, the incentives for public to do plastic clean recycling is low. These factors discourage plastic recycling practices in Hong Kong and cause a large proportion of non-recycled plastic waste being dumped into the landfill every day. Since plastic is derived from petrochemicals, it usually has a comparable heating value with fuels, which is favorable in carrying out waste-to-energy (WTE) process and too valuable to throw away. Overseas countries apply WTE to recover the energy of plastic waste via thermochemical process. In some countries, plastic waste can be 100 % recycled and recovered in energy with landfill ban. In this research, the feasibility of WTE and its role in plastic waste management is studied. It was found the application in WTE for the treatment of plastic waste mixed with MSW is technically feasible. It is a significant means in waste management to relieve the space occupying by MSW in landfill and generate energy from waste by energy recovery technologies, for example, incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, etc. The result of study shows that, WTE is a financially feasible and eco-efficient means in non-recycled plastic waste treatment. WTE fills the gap between recycling and disposal in local plastic waste management. Public accepts the development of WTE for the treatment of non-recycled plastic waste in Hong Kong. Also, citizens welcome such measures to reduce the space of plastic waste occupied in landfill and the generation of energy in terms of electricity from plastic <b>waste.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of development of such facilities in Hong Kong are discussed. Location of the proposed facilities is always a controversial topic. Recommendations are given to deal with the possible difficulties encountered in the development of WTE for the non-separated and non-recycled plastic waste. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of ethical consumerism, the interest for food waste and food waste prevention is steadily growing. A significant portion of food waste is created at the household level, therefore consumer behavior and its psychological antecedents are very important in relation to this timely issue. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991), the current study investigated whether the intention to reduce household food waste could be predicted by attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Moreover, research aims to investigate the effect of food waste habits on intentions to reduce food waste. Do habits influence the future intention to reduce food waste? If this is the case, is this effect direct, or rather mediated by attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, as the TPB would predict? Finally, we were interested to test {{the effects of a}} set of key concerns emerged in a recent study (La Barbera et al., 2016) on the food waste habit. Results show that the TPB constructs adequately predict participants’ future intention to reduce food waste. In line with the TPB, food waste habit indirectly affects future intention through the mediation of attitude and perceived behavioral control. Finally, we found that the concern related to the negative environmental consequences of food waste is the only one which significantly affects food <b>waste</b> habit. <b>Limitation,</b> practical implication, and future developments of the study are discussed...|$|R

Yet, waste problems persist. Although research concerning waste practices and problems is voluminous, previous research has focused on particular waste issues or on case studies. Even though focusing on particular areas of study increases what is known about <b>waste,</b> such <b>limitations</b> preclude providing an overview of waste practices and problems. An overview is needed to determine how to solve waste problems in general. To provide an overview, this study describes and classifies waste practices and problems of the United States and of Chicago, in particular.

Classifications of waste practices are technical. Except for occasional asides, the special problems of radioactive waste are not examined. This study concludes that waste is a national problem that has not been solved because people's attitudes about waste are an impediment to solving waste problems.

40|$|The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) waste {{management}} strategy revolves around specific treatment of individual {{or groups of}} separated waste streams. A goal for the separations processes is to efficiently manage the waste to be dispositioned as high level radioactive waste. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) baseline technology for immobilization of the lanthanide (Ln) and transition metal fission product (TM) wastes is vitrification into a borosilicate glass. A current interest is to evaluate the feasibility of vitrifying combined waste streams to most cost effectively immobilize the wastes resulting from aqueous fuel reprocessing. Studies showed that high waste loadings are achievable for the Ln only (Option 1) stream. Waste loadings in excess of 60 wt % (on a calcined oxide basis) were demonstrated via a lanthanide borosilicate (LaBS) glass. The resulting glasses had excellent relative durability {{as determined by the}} Product Consistency Test (PCT). For a combined Ln and TM waste stream glass (Option 2), noble metal solubility was found to limit waste loading. However, the measured PCT normalized elemental releases for this glass were at least an order of magnitude below that of Environmental Assessment (EA) glass.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program is to provide fundamental scientific information on the {{physical and chemical properties}} of solutes in aqueous solutions at high temperatures needed to assess and enhance the applicability of hydrothermal oxidation (HTO) to the remediation of DOE hazardous and mixed <b>wastes.</b> Potential <b>limitations</b> to the use of HTO technology include formation of deposits (scale) from precipitation of inorganic solutes in the waste, corrosion arising from formation of strong acids on oxidation of some organic compounds (e. g., chlorinated hydrocarbons), and unknown effects of fluid density and phase behavior at high temperatures. Focus areas for this project include measurements of the solubility and speciation of actinides and surrogates in model HTO process streams at high temperatures, and the experimental and theoretical development of equations of state for aqueous mixtures under HTO process conditions ranging above the critical temperature of water. A predictive level of understanding of the chemical and physical properties of HTO process streams is being developed through molecular-level simulations of aqueous solutions at high temperatures. Advances in fundamental understanding of phase behavior, density, and solute speciation at high temperatures and pressures contribute directly to the ultimate applicability of this process for the treatment of DOE hazardous and mixed wastes. Research in this project has been divided into individual tasks, with each contributing to a unified understanding of HTO processing problems related to the treatment of DOE wastes.

6000|$|The vast <b>waste</b> {{which this}} <b>limitation</b> of {{prospect}} entails {{is the most}} grievous rejection of moral treasure, if it be true that nothing enriches the nature like wide sympathy and many-coloured appreciativeness. To a man like Macaulay, for example, criticism was only a tribunal before which men were brought to be decisively tried by one or two inflexible tests, and then sent to join the sheep on the one hand, or the goats on the other. His pages are the record of sentences passed, not the presentation of human characters in all their fulness and colour; and the consequence is that even now and so soon, {{in spite of all}} their rhetorical brilliance, their hold on men has grown slack. Contrast the dim depths into which his essay on Johnson is receding, with the vitality as of a fine dramatic creation which exists in Mr. Carlyle's essay on the same man. Mr. Carlyle knows as well as Macaulay how blind and stupid a creed was English Toryism a century ago, but he seizes and reproduces the character of his man, and this was much more than a matter of a creed. So with Burns. He was drunken and unchaste and thriftless, and Mr. Carlyle holds all these vices as deeply in reprobation as if he had written ten thousand sermons against them; but he leaves the fulmination to the hack moralist of the pulpit or the press, with whom words are cheap, easily gotten, and readily thrown forth. To him it seems better worth while, having made sure of some sterling sincerity and rare genuineness of vision and singular human quality, to dwell on, and do justice to that, than to accumulate commonplaces as to the viciousness of vice. Here we may perhaps find the explanation of the remarkable fact that though Mr. Carlyle has written about a large number of men of all varieties of opinion and temperament, and written with emphasis and point and strong feeling, yet there is hardly one of these judgments, however much we may dissent from it, which we could fairly put a finger upon as indecently absurd or futile.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A {{series of}} four animal {{experiments}} utilizing 129 pigs and associated laboratory studies {{was conducted to}} study {{the causes of the}} lowered performance on high barley rations fed to swine. Previous work at this Station has shown barley to have a value of 80 - 85 percent of corn for swine, and demonstrated that barley hull is responsible for the major part of the growth depression when it is present in swine rations. Numerous trials have been conducted at this Station to overcome the limitation imposed by hull material in high barley swine rations. Outside of pearling, which was completely successful in overcoming the depressive effect of barley; soaking, enzyme treatment, pelleting, and the addition of fat have been used with varying degrees of success. Pelleting has been the most successful of the latter four treatments, yet its beneficial effect is lost upon regrinding of the pellets. Recent work has indicated that soaking high barley swine feeds may be beneficial. The recent finding that antibiotics interfere with nutritional improvement of barley for poultry during water treatment suggested that a part of the benefit of soaking had been lost due to the presence of antibiotics in the swine rations. Addition of enzymes specific for cellulose, the major structural component of barley hull, has not been demonstrated to be of any advantage, yet conditions have not been optimum in terms of the enzyme's potential activity. These findings were considered in the objectives and design of the experiments described herein. Ground and whole barley were soaked for 24 hours at 30 C. before being mixed with the protein supplement just prior to feeding. Pigs receiving ground, soaked barley grew 4. 2 percent faster on 3. 2 percent less feed compared to the same ration fed dry but these differences were not significant. Pigs receiving soaked whole barley grew 12. 2 percent slower and required 17. 0 percent more feed than those which received the ground soaked barley ration. These differences were significant (P<. 01). Pigs receiving whole barley soaked with constant aeration and with added cellulase 4000 enzyme did not differ significantly in growth rate nor feed efficiency from a lot which received whole, soaked barley. There was a six percent reduction in the cellulose content of barley treated with the enzyme preparation. The addition of five percent fat to a high barley ration improved feed efficiency but not rate of gain. The production of a pellet containing five percent added fat with the same density as the pelleted control ration, through use of a specially-constructed die, resulted in increases in both rate and efficiency of gain. Fatness as measured by back fat thickness was significantly increased by the fat-containing pellet. Feed waste and its causes were studied. Waste varied from 3 to 25 percent with group-fed pigs depending upon the form of the ration and the type of feeder used. Individually-fed pigs wasted from 7 to 36 percent of the feed when fed alike indicating that waste varies greatly from one pig to another. Pelleting of a meal ration reduced the amount of feed wasted from an average of 12. 18 to 3. 08 percent. Pigs consume more pellets than meal of similar composition even though the apparent disappearance from the feeder of the two forms is similar. Electronic measurement of feeding time showed that pigs spent 16. 74 percent of the day consuming meal and only 7. 34 percent of the day eating pellets of the same composition. A photographic study and close observation showed that pigs fed meal spend considerable time sorting out barley hull. Chemical analysis of the material wasted out of the feeders had a fiber content 2. 5 times as high as the original ration. The studies reconfirm the conclusion that hull is primarily responsible for the lowered performance of barley rations. Barley hull splinters which result from grinding the grain apparently reduce the amount of feed the animal will consume while increasing feeding time and feed waste. Pelleting enables the animal to consume more of the ration in less time with less <b>waste.</b> The <b>limitation</b> imposed by barley hull upon swine performance appears {{to be associated with the}} prehension of feed rather than exclusively with mechanical interference in digestion and absorption of nutrients as previously believed...|$|R
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} presentada en el Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Tencnología del Medio Ambiente de la Universidad de Oviedo. 2011. Directores: Ramón Álvarez García y Mª Antonia Díez Díaz-EstébanezThe {{environmental impact}} due to waste production, {{both domestic and}} industrial, has become a maximum priority of environmental policies in developed countries. Even though waste management has undergone a significant evolution in the last decades, the waste recovery continues being of great importance to achieve sustainable development and compatible with the environmental protection; so it has been necessary to allocate time and resources to develop processes to ensure that plastic recycling is an economically profitable process, and in this way, it helps to decrease the amount of residues designated to landfill disposal. As a result of recent European legislation for management and recovery of plastic wastes from packaging, is being promoted {{the development of new}} processes of mechanical and chemical recycling and energy recovery, in order to achieve the recycling objectives. Other type of wastes which gives good reasons for special attention are used oils, so common in our daily lives, and used in the operation of industrial machinery, automotive vehicles or transmission hydraulic systems, to mention some of the most significant examples. The loss of their properties after the continued use is unfortunately accompanied by the generation of residual oils, therefore, it is necessary to establish measures to minimize as much as possible the production of these hazardous wastes and promote that the generated wastes are managed by the alternatives which ensure environmental protection and health of people. The development of new recycling ways to allow the recovery of both types of residues is very important in order to keep as many options open, especially when an existing industrial process can be used and it is not necessary any operational variation made by the industry. In this sense, integrated steel plants can be considered as an option for those <b>wastes</b> with technical <b>limitations</b> for conventional recycling. The combination of the blast furnace route and coke plant in the steel industry, provide a way to expand feedstock recycling with economic, social and environmental benefits. In the present work we have studied the viability of this action via, the cocarbonization of the wastes with coal for the production of coke, which feeds the blast furnace to produce iron which subsequently will be transformed into steel. To achieve this general objective, the specific objectives focus on the study of the influence on the coking properties of an individual coal and three coal blends used by the industry for blast-furnace coke production, of the six more common thermoplastics in the domestic wastes (LOPE, HOPE, PP, PS, PET and PVC), and six mixtures of them, covering a wide range of compositions. Also, nine lube-oils were used. Oils have paraffin nature except one of them which is a synthetic oil containing organic esters. Two oils mixtures were prepared based on their thermal behaviour and as reference materials a coal-tar and a coaltar pitch were used. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Classical extraction procedures utilise large amounts of hazardous solvents, generate <b>waste,</b> and sensitivity <b>limitations</b> {{are associated with the}} injection of microlitre amounts of the final solvent extract. In response to real world challenges, and to overcome the problems associated with solvent extraction, novel silicone rubber (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) samplers were developed for solvent free enrichment of trace level analytes from indoor air, contaminated soil, desert soil, ultra high temperature (UHT) milk and Pinotage wine. Versatile PDMS samplers as a loop, a multichannel trap, or a denuder for trace environmental forensics, geochemical and aroma investigations are presented. A unique off-line multidimensional GC approach involving heart-cut gas chromatographic fraction collection is described, as is off-line olfactory assessment of recombined heart-cuts for synergistic odour effects. PDMS loop samplers were used for the extraction of DDT (1, 1, 1 - trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane) and its associated environmental pollutants from soil samples. Miniature denuder samplers accomplished separate concentration of vapour phase and of particulate phase fractions of DDT and its associated environmental pollutants from indoor air, in a single step. Ratios of airborne p,p’-DDD/p,p’-DDT and of o,p’-DDT/p,p’-DDT are unusual and do not match the ideal certified ingredient composition required of commercial DDT. Results suggest that commercial DDT used for indoor residual spraying may have been compromised with regards to insecticidal efficacy, demonstrating the power of this new environmental forensics tool. Multichannel PDMS trap samplers were used in a unique heart-cut multidimensional GC approach for off-line enantiomeric separation of o,p’-DDT and o,p’-DDD in air and soil. This alternative multidimensional method is compared to the complementary technique of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection (GCxGC-TOFMS). PDMS loop samplers were also employed for the solvent free extraction of hydrocarbons from desert soil to investigate, for the first time, a possible geochemical origin of the enigmatic fairy circles of Namibia. It is proposed that microseepages of natural gas and low volatility hydrocarbons are expressed at the surface as a geobotanical anomaly of barren circles and circles of altered vegetation. Multichannel PDMS trap samplers were utilised for sampling of the headspace of UHT milk and of Pinotage wine, and to study off-line, using a portable olfactometer, synergistic effects between recombined heart-cut aroma compounds. Olfactory results show that a synergistic combination of 2 - heptanone and 2 -nonanone was responsible for a pungent cheese-like odour in UHT milk, while a synergistic combination of furfural and 2 -furanmethanol was responsible for a roast coffee bean-like odour in coffee style Pinotage wine. The small, low cost samplers are quick and easy to assemble and they fit commercial thermal desorber systems. The PDMS samplers are reusable. Solvent extraction of the sampling materials, extract clean-up and pre-concentration are not required. Thus, potential loss of analyte, introduction of contaminants and waste disposal are minimised. Solvent free thermal desorption permits transfer of the entire sample mass to the cooled injection system (CIS) inlet of a GC resulting in greater sensitivity when compared to injection of microlitre amounts of a solvent extract. This allowed for sampling of smaller sized soil samples, shorter air sampling times and lower air sampling flow rates when compared to solvent based methods.

40|$|A {{workshop}} {{was held}} on January 23 - 24, 2007 to discuss the status of processes to leach constituents from High Level Waste (HLW) sludges at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites. The objective of the workshop {{was to examine the}} needs and requirements for the HLW flowsheet for each site, discuss the status of knowledge of the leaching processes, communicate the research plans, and identify opportunities for synergy to address knowledge gaps. The purpose of leaching of non-radioactive constituents from the sludge waste is to reduce the burden of material that must be vitrified in the HLW melter systems, resulting in reduced HLW glass waste volume, reduced disposal costs, shorter process schedules, and higher facility throughput rates. The leaching process is estimated to reduce the operating life cycle of SRS by seven years and decrease the number of HLW canisters to be disposed in the Repository by 1000 [Gillam et al., 2006]. Comparably at Hanford, the aluminum and chromium leaching processes are estimated to reduce the operating life cycle of the Waste Treatment Plant by 20 years and decrease the number of canisters to the Repository by 15, 000 - 30, 000 [Gilbert, 2007]. These leaching processes will save the Department of Energy (DOE) billions of dollars in clean up and disposal costs. The primary constituents targeted for removal by leaching are aluminum and chromium. It is desirable to have some aluminum in glass to improve its durability; however, too much aluminum can increase the sludge viscosity, glass viscosity, and reduce overall process throughput. Chromium leaching is necessary to prevent formation of crystalline compounds in the glass, but is only needed at Hanford because of differences in the sludge waste chemistry at the two sites. Improving glass formulations to increase tolerance of aluminum and chromium is another approach to decrease HLW glass volume. It is likely that an optimum condition can be found by both performing leaching and improving formulations. Disposal of the resulting aluminum and chromium-rich streams are different at the two sites, with vitrification into Low Activity Waste (LAW) glass at Hanford, and solidification in Saltstone at SRS. Prior to disposal, the leachate solutions must be treated to remove radionuclides, resulting in increased operating costs and extended facility processing schedules. Interim storage of leachate can also add costs and delay tank closure. Recent projections at Hanford indicate that up to 40, 000 metric tons of sodium would be needed to dissolve the aluminum and maintain it in solution, which nearly doubles the amount of sodium in the entire current waste tank inventory. This underscores the dramatic impact that the aluminum leaching can have on the entire system. A comprehensive view of leaching and the downstream impacts must therefore be considered prior to implementation. Many laboratory scale tests for aluminum and chromium dissolution have been run on Hanford wastes, with samples from 46 tanks tested. Three samples from SRS tanks have been tested, out of seven tanks containing high aluminum sludge. One full-scale aluminum dissolution was successfully performed on waste at SRS in 1982, but generated a very large quantity of liquid waste ({approx} 3, 000, 000 gallons). No large-scale tests have been done on Hanford wastes. Although the data to date give a generally positive indication that aluminum dissolution will work, many issues remain, predominantly because of variable waste compositions and changes in process conditions, downstream processing, or storage limitations. Better approaches are needed to deal with the <b>waste</b> volumes and <b>limitations</b> on disposal methods. To develop a better approach requires a more extensive understanding of the kinetics of dissolution, as well as the factors that effect rates, effectiveness, and secondary species. Models of the dissolution rate that have been developed are useful, but suffer from limitations on applicable compositional ranges, mineral phases, and particle properties that are difficult to measure. The experimental bases for the models contain very few data points...|$|R
