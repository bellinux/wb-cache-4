2500|$|The Guardian {{reported}} the brutal campaign by the Somali government against the Isaaq: Hundred of Thousands {{of people have}} been killed, dispersed or bombed out of their homes in northern Somalia after government military operations which Western aid <b>workers</b> <b>say</b> are little short of genocide.The action has been concentrated on the three northern towns of Hargeisa, Berbera and Burao where some 20,000 people are believed to have died in recent bombing raids by the government ... Many thousands of others are being systematically denied food because Somali forces are deliberately holding up essential supplies. Aid officials said that up to 800,000 people – almost all of them Issaq nomads – have been displaced {{as a result of the}} civil war. A quarter of these, and possibly as many as 300,000, were now struggling to survive in wretched conditions in refugee camps in Ethiopia while a similar number had been forced to leave Africa. The fate of those who can no longer be traced remains largely unknown.... Until about eight months ago, the urbanised population of Issaqi were concentrated in Hargeisa, Berbera and Burao. Although few journalists have been authorised to visit the area, tens of thousands of people are understood to have died during a series of bombing raids on the towns last August conducted mainly by mercenaries recruited in Zimbabwe.... "they just bombed and bombed and bombed," [...] an [...] agency man, recently returned from Somalia said. Hargeisa which originally had a population of 350,000, was 70 percent destroyed, Burao was [...] "devastated" [...] in the same raids.Issaqis who survived the bombings are said to have been rounded up in the streets by Somali troops and summarily shot. Mass graves have since been found as well as corpses which were left to rot in the streets where they fell.The people now living in the three towns are believed to be totally non-Issaqi or military personnel who have been deputed to guard what has been retaken from the SNM.|$|E

They were known to social services in both Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire, but the abuse was not recognised.

50|$|Apamea pallifera was {{originally}} described in Polia, but listed in Andropolia by Franclemont and Todd (1983) and Poole (1989).

Eurasian <b>workers</b> <b>say</b> it is not Eurasian. It is possible that it is an extremely rare species that has never been recollected, a situation somewhat similar to that of Apamea smythi. The type has not yet been dissected but the form of the anal papillae put it with the Apamea species groups with blunt, rounded anal papillae.|$|E

But instead of giving these workers the medical and financial help they need, Boeing -- with the help of its connections within state government and the medical establishment -- is saying many workers just have psychological problems."

5000|$|Alem is {{a refugee}} from Ethiopia. His parents are both Eritrean and Ethiopian. Alem then escapes to England from a violent {{civil war in}} Badme, {{which at the time}} of the novel (2000/1999), was disputed to be either in Ethiopia or in Eritrea. In 1991, 6 year old Alem and his father are in the capital of Eritrea, his mother's home country. When Alem is ten years old, he and his family move to Harar in Ethiopia, his father's country. In Ethiopia, his father gets a better job within the postal service, but Alem's mother loses her job because the Ethiopian <b>workers</b> <b>say</b> they are [...] "at war with Eritrea, so they will not work with someone from Eritrea." [...] Alem's father is then told by his {{co-workers}} that he must leave his wife because she is Eritrean and therefore [...] "the enemy". The mother was held at point blank before pushed on the bus.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{very common}} for line and staff workers to come into conflict. Staff specialists say line workers avoid and ignore them, and line <b>workers</b> <b>say</b> staff workers lack {{expertise}} in the organization's core work, distract them, and get in their way. American organizational sociologist Melville Dalton attributed this to [...] "the conspicuous ambition and individualistic behavior among staff managers," [...] staff's anxiety to justify their existence, and the dependence of highly ranked staff managers on line managers. Other management theorists have observed that line managers sometimes resent staff advisors for being younger and better-educated than they are. Others attribute the problem to staff managers not realizing that {{even though they have}} been delegated authority in particular areas, their primary role is to serve and support line managers. Management textbooks advise resolving line-staff conflict by explicitly recognizing the mutual dependency of the two, making it clear what the staff role is, de-emphasizing any controlling elements of the staff role, having staff deliberately set out to win the confidence and trust of line workers, and emphasizing the staff role as part of the team.|$|E
25|$|The South China Morning Post {{reports the}} rise in the use of ketamine, easy to mass-produce in illicit labs in {{southern}} China, particularly among the young. Because of its low cost, and low profit margin, drug peddlers rely on mass distribution to make money, thus increasing its penetrative power to all, including schoolchildren. The journal cites social <b>workers</b> <b>saying</b> that four people can get high by sharing just HK$20 worth of ketamine, and estimates 80 per cent of young drug addicts take 'K'.|$|R

When told in 1995 that he also potentially faced arrest (charges were never pressed), he shot himself. A former party <b>worker</b> <b>says</b> Jack was an innocent killed by a corrupt system.
