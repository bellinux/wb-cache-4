500|$|In 1954, Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird {{speculated that}} Deinosuchus [...] "may {{very well have}} hunted and devoured some of the dinosaurs with which it was contemporaneous". Colbert restated this {{hypothesis}} more confidently in 1961: [...] "Certainly this crocodile {{must have been a}} predator of dinosaurs; otherwise why <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so overwhelmingly gigantic? It hunted in the water where the giant theropods could not go." [...] David R. Schwimmer proposed in 2002 that several hadrosaurid tail vertebrae found near Big Bend National Park show evidence of Deinosuchus tooth marks, strengthening the hypothesis that Deinosuchus fed on dinosaurs in at least some instances. In 2003, Christopher A. Brochu agreed that Deinosuchus [...] "probably dined on ornithopods from time to time." [...] Deinosuchus is generally thought to have employed hunting tactics similar to those of modern crocodilians, ambushing dinosaurs and other terrestrial animals at the water's edge and then submerging them until they drowned. A 2014 study suggested {{that it would have been}} able to perform a [...] "death roll", like modern crocodiles.|$|E
2500|$|According to Carp's own words: [...] "We {{have entered}} the era of revenge acts {{initiated}} by scoundrels and nitwits." [...] However, the National Liberal establishment was itself unsure about how to approach the Carp dilemma. Discussing the 1919 prosecutions in his later essays, PNL leader Ion G. Duca asserted: [...] "Should one have limited them to the Carpists? [...] Could one, {{in the name of}} holy justice, punish them, without also punishing Carp, their leader and inspiration? And <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> politically sound to prosecute Carp, at his more than 80 years of age, after his 50 years of honest public life?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The 46 {{questions}} in the lineamenta covered {{many of the same}} topics as the questionnaire sent out in advance of the 2014 Synod. [...] They asked about [...] "all aspects of the promotion of authentic family values, the training of clergy in family ministry, the way the Church can be more present among those living far away from the Christian faith, and the care of families that are wounded and fragile." [...] "How <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possible to talk about the family without engaging families, listening to their joys and hopes, their pain and anxieties?” Pope Francis asked.|$|E

2500|$|Block {{was then}} {{assigned}} to {{the staff at the}} BBC to add American comedic sensibility to the Anglo-American Hour and Yankee Doodle Doo radio programs. Maurice Gorham, BBC executive and journalist who had [...] "seen a lot of Block" [...] during his BBC days, gave his impressions of Block as [...] "a real Broadway type who reminded me of a Damon Runyon character suddenly set down in a Broadcasting House." [...] His contribution to the BBC was once singled out by the North American Representative of the BBC, Lindsay Wellington, to dispute Associated Press accusations of excessive British censorship. In a December 6, 1943 letter to the New York Times he wrote, [...] "Nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possible for Hal Block, American scriptwriter, to write the highly popular London-produced program for combined U.S. and British soldier audiences Yankee Doodle Doo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes it is {{suggested}} that Ellen White herself said that her writings were not necessary for our salvation. This statement may clarify her meaning. [...] "If man had kept the law of God, as given to Adam after his fall, preserved by Noah, and observed by Abraham, {{there would have been no}} necessity for the ordinance of circumcision. And if the descendants of Abraham had kept the covenant, of which circumcision was a sign, they would never have been seduced into idolatry, nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> necessary for them to suffer a life of bondage in Egypt; they would have kept God's law in mind, and there would have been no necessity for it to be proclaimed from Sinai or engraved upon the tables of stone. And had the people practiced the principles of the ten commandments, there would have been no need of the additional directions given to Moses." [...] (PP 364) ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah {{differed}} {{interpreting the}} words, [...] "Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah taught that only [...] "in his generations" [...] {{was he a}} righteous man (by comparison). Had {{he lived in the}} generation of Moses or Samuel, he would not have been called righteous. Rabbi Judah said that in the street of the totally blind, the one-eyed man is called clear-sighted, and the infant is called a scholar. Rabbi Judah compared it to a man with a wine vault who opened one barrel and found it vinegar, opened another and found it vinegar, and opened a third to find it turning sour. When people told him that it was turning, he asked if the vault contained any better. Similarly, [...] "in his generations" [...] Noah was a righteous man. Rabbi Nehemiah, however, taught that if Noah was righteous even in his generation (in spite of the corrupt environment), how much more so would he have been, had he lived in the age of Moses. Rabbi Nehemiah compared Noah to a tightly closed vial of perfume in a graveyard, which nevertheless gave forth a fragrant aroma. How much more fragrant <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> outside the graveyard.|$|E

2500|$|In 1862 {{the newly}} created State Board of Agriculture {{appointed}} English Literature professor Theophilus Capen ("T.C.") Abbot president, much to the professor's surprise. Nevertheless, the soft-spoken Abbot remained president for twenty-two years and helped stabilize the College {{during and after the}} Civil War. One of the College's main concerns was that its Morrill Act endowment had attracted the University of Michigan's attention. [...] Advocates for the University brought a bill before the State Legislature to merge with the Agricultural College and move the Lansing faculty and facilities to the Ann Arbor campus. UM leaders argued that it was necessary to share the Morrill Act income with the financially struggling UM. At least one influential pro-merger advocate appeared persuaded more by pure academic considerations than financial self-interest. [...] Andrew Dickson White, Cornell University co-founder and first president, noted, “The State of Michigan [...] [...] [...] indeed gave its Agricultural College an excellent faculty and they have achieved much success considering their means but infinitely better <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> to combine that Agricultural College with their noble University.” [...] While the plan initially had broad support across the state, merger opponents pointed out that Ann Arbor had inadequate facilities for an agricultural education; a move to Ann Arbor would require so much investment capital as to make the UM plan financially untenable. The Legislature voted down UM's proposal in 1863, but it returned to the floor in 1865, 1867, and again in 1869. While the College successfully fended off each takeover attempt, the persistent threat that it might move kept the Legislature from appropriating any money for new campus construction at Lansing. As a result, the College was restricted to one boarding hall and enrollment was accordingly limited for many years thereafter.|$|E

500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and noncompliance {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing [...] "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|R
