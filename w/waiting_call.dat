Cobb had promised to tell Veach about the scheme when the season was over, but never did. When Heilmann tried to explain, Veach reportedly snarled, [...] "Don't come sucking around me with that phony line". Veach never forgave Heilmann.

50|$|Cogeco Cable {{launched}} its digital phone service in June 2005, a VoIP-based telephony service offering customers unlimited local & long distance calling within Canada {{and to the}} United States, voice mail, call display, call waiting, visual call <b>waiting,</b> <b>call</b> forwarding, 411-directory assistance, 911-emergency assistance, 611-technical support assistance, 711-message relay services & 0-operator services.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of telephony, a {{telephone}} line (the system) typically offers a set of features that include call forwarding and call <b>waiting.</b> <b>Call</b> waiting allows one call to be suspended while a second call is answered, while call forwarding enables a customer to specify a secondary phone number to which additional calls will be forwarded {{in the event that}} the customer is already using the phone.|$|E
5000|$|Since the <b>waiting</b> <b>call</b> {{creates an}} audible signal (for example, a [...] beep every ten seconds in North America), call waiting can cause dial-up Internet access {{connections}} to terminate, unless the modem supports {{the most recent}} V.92 modem standard. For this reason, call waiting is often disabled on shared voice lines used for dial-up modem or fax purposes. However, Call Waiting has no impact on DSL connections.|$|E

50|$|In this way, {{the agent}} is spared {{the time of}} dialing a <b>call</b> and <b>waiting</b> for an answer, and can simply speak to <b>waiting</b> <b>calls</b> that have been already set up. Additionally, if a number is {{determined}} to be disconnected, the equipment will usually mark that number as such and will not dial it again or as often.|$|R
50|$|Caller ID, <b>call</b> <b>waiting,</b> conference <b>calling,</b> {{voicemail}} {{and account}} notifications were standard features. International roaming was not supported. Access to voicemail from the mobile handset incurred local or long distance rates; messages also were retrievable {{by calling the}} mobile number from another telephone.|$|R
50|$|Current plans include {{unlimited}} {{local and}} provincial calling, unlimited sent SMS and MMS to Canada and continental USA, unlimited received messages from any regular {{phone number and}} the caller ID, call <b>waiting,</b> <b>call</b> forwarding and conference call calling features. All regular plans except for the one at $25 include Canada-wide long distance, unlimited sent SMS to regular international phone numbers, one of two mobile broadband options and the voicemail calling feature.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} {{spoofing}} {{is that of}} emulating the Bell 202 FSK signal. This method, informally called orange boxing, uses software that generates the audio signal which is then coupled to the telephone line during the call. The object is to deceive the called party into thinking {{that there is an}} incoming call <b>waiting</b> <b>call</b> from the spoofed number, when in fact there is no new incoming call. This technique often also involves an accomplice who may provide a secondary voice to complete the illusion of a call-waiting call. Because the orange box cannot truly spoof an incoming caller ID prior to answering and relies to a certain extent on the guile of the caller, it is considered as much a social engineering technique as a technical hack.|$|E
