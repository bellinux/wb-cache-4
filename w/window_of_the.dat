5|$|Home met one of {{his future}} closest friends in 1867; the young Lord Adare (later the 4th Earl of Dunraven). Adare was fascinated by Home, and began documenting the séances they held. The {{following}} year, Home {{was said to have}} levitated out of the third storey window of one room, and back in through the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adjoining room in front of three witnesses (Adare, Captain Wynne, and Lord Lindsay).|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south aisle {{of the church is}} a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aisle, is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E

Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mansion, killing him. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him before departing. As the police and neighbors gather, Kim leads them to believe that Jim and Edward killed each other.|$|E
5|$|St. Rynagh's Church {{houses a}} {{work by the}} {{well-known}} German sculptor, Imogen Stuart, called The Madonna and Child, a mandorla carved in 1974. The most outstanding feature of St. Paul's Church is the <b>Window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Resurrection, a stained-glass window commemorating the Bell family that was originally intended for Westminister Abbey in London.|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 15th century {{on the site of}} a wooden building dating from the 12th century. In the 16th century a new facade was added to the original building. It is possible that the stonework and <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front wall were removed from the abbot's lodgings behind the great kitchen of the Abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving, and it is known that the {{building was}} ruined and without its front wall by 1723.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{stained glass}} <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16th century are adorned with figures done in Renaissance style. On these worked such renowned masters as Vasco de Troya (in 1502), Juan de Cuesta (1506) and Alejo Ximénez (1509-1513), {{who worked on}} those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side naves and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west façade. <b>The</b> stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rose <b>Window</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Portal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lions are by Nicolás de Vergara el Mozo.|$|R

5|$|The ponies {{collect the}} Elements and re-approach Discord, who casually passes off their threat. However, with all six ponies restored, the Elements activate, firing a rainbow-beam {{of light that}} engulfs Discord and Ponyville. In moments, Ponyville has been {{returned}} to normal and Discord is once again turned to stone. The ponies' victory is celebrated by a large ceremony at Canterlot, led by Celestia, who praises their heroism {{and the power of}} their friendship and reveals a new stained-glass <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six ponies defeating Discord.|$|E
5|$|Unusually {{for someone}} {{physically}} removed from power, Baxter {{was allowed to}} remain free in Pulaski County. He first retired to the Anthony House, three blocks away from the State Capitol. Ads placed in the Gazette indicate that the Anthony House continued to function as an upscale hotel during {{the entirety of the}} crisis. Fighting occurred outside the hotel, and at least one man, David Fulton Shall, a prominent real estate dealer, was shot dead while standing in a <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E
5|$|In 1826 {{an ornate}} range was erected by St Mary Hall in the Gothic Revival style, {{incorporating}} the old gate of St Mary Hall, {{on the west}} side of the quad. Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are the best example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Hurricane Gloria {{blew out}} a <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{monument}}. In 1986, the State of Connecticut spent $6250 to re-mortar the monument. The monument was closed until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding the entrance, and Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E
5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked through the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E

5|$|Later, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} the shark that killed him is the first shark's mother, and that {{it must also be}} inside the park. She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{continued}} into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman through the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door she had just locked.|$|E
5|$|The central <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial is on {{the other}} side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E

5|$|The chapel on {{the upper}} floor became a store room in the early 1980s for pieces being sold off. The stained glass <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel, with the Spencer crest, dates to 1588, and was brought to Althorp from Wormleigton. The organ {{on the other hand}} is far more recent, {{acquired}} from the parish of Meriden in the 1990s. A number of earlier occupants of Althorp, particularly George John and Frederick, were devout Christians and would preach in the chapel, and Robert, 6th Earl Spencer would hold a daily service here. It is still used for family christenings, and for services at Christmas, Easter and Harvest Thanksgiving.|$|E
5|$|The east range, of c.1635, {{comprises}} a long, narrow building, {{with a short}} {{projecting wing}} to the south-east. It is {{the only part of}} the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among other furniture. In the south-east wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated with fruit, foliage, and heraldic emblems. The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on one corner. The east <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.|$|E
5|$|There are {{grotesque}} {{figures of}} vetalas (ghosts) on the pilasters of jaga mohan {{and on the}} faces of vimana of the temple. The figures of nagas (snake-man) and their female counterparts nagins and other females show many graceful but chaste poses. Pilgrimage is the theme of many of the scenes on the vimana. The other notable descriptive representation on the vimana is the hunting scene above the central niche on the south side, where stags are depicted running away from a hunter. On the outermost frame around the latticed <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaganamohana, delightful scenes of monkeys playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The bada of the vimana abruptly starts from the talapatna or pavement which consists of three elements instead of the usual five and encloses a parallelepiped instead of the usual cubic sanctum.|$|E
