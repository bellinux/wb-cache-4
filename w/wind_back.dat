However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng was anxious to curtail the autonomy that his father had granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly <b>wind</b> <b>back</b> their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E

Perkins entered into a business relationship with John and Margaret Kelly whose son Todd drove for the team in 2008, to provide the engineering services for their newly formed Kelly Racing. Many Perkins Engineering staff, equipment and sponsors moved to Kelly Racing including the team's three VE Commodores and Jack Daniels.|$|E

25|$|Khánh {{used the}} coup to enact {{retribution}} against Minh, Đôn, Kim, Đính and Xuân. He had them arrested, {{claiming that they}} were part of a neutralist plot with the French. Khánh cited their service in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration as evidence, although he did as well. Khánh also had Major Nhung, the bodyguard of Minh, shot, causing riots among parts of the population who feared that Khánh would <b>wind</b> <b>back</b> the clock to the Diệm era. Khánh later persuaded Minh to remain as a figurehead head of state. This was partly due to pressure from American officials, who felt that the popular Minh would be a unifying and stabilising factor in the new regime. However, Khánh soon sidelined Minh.|$|E
2500|$|At noon on Thursday, September 25, 1902, under Captain Leatham, Harrison {{departed}} Astoria for Yaquina Bay with {{a load of}} canning supplies. [...] During {{the voyage}} south down the coast, the steamer encountered a strong gale blowing from the south, but Captain Leatham kept the vessel on course into the wind until, about [...] from Yaquina, the Harrison {{was found to be}} leaking so badly that all its pumps could only just keep up with the leakage. [...] Leatham then decided to turn around and run before the <b>wind</b> <b>back</b> to Astoria. [...] Normally in proceeding into a strong wind, Harrison would have hoisted a jib sail to steady the vessel, but the one on board at the time was old and could not be relied upon to hold up in winds as strong as Harrison encountered that day. [...] The cause of the leakage was not immediately known, but it was believed that the seams may have opened in the ship’s hull, or some of its keel or rudder bolts worked loose.|$|E
2500|$|Supporters of the fathers' rights {{movement}} assert {{that some women}} make false claims of domestic violence, sexual or child abuse {{in order to gain}} an upper hand in divorce, custody disputes and/or prevent fathers from seeing their children, and they state that lawyers advise women to make such claims. They state that false claims of domestic violence and child abuse are encouraged by the inflammatory [...] "win or lose" [...] nature of child custody hearings, that men are presumed to be guilty rather than innocent by police and by the courts, Lawyers and advocates for abused women assert that family court proceedings are commonly accompanied with allegations of domestic violence because of the prevalence of domestic violence in society rather than as a result of false allegations of domestic violence. They also assert that domestic violence often begins or increases around the time of divorce or separation. Academic critic, Michael Flood, argues that fathers' rights groups have had a damaging impact on the field of domestic violence programming and policy by attempting to discredit female victims of violence, to <b>wind</b> <b>back</b> the legal protections available to victims and the sanctions imposed on perpetrators, and to undermine services for the victims of men's violence. Stephen Baskerville asserts that when child abuse occurs the perpetrator {{is not likely to be}} the father, and that child abuse most often occurs after the father has been separated from his children. Baskerville proposes that domestic violence and child abuse must be adjudicated as criminal assault, observing due process protections, and that government funding for programs addressing these issues must be made contingent on such protections.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} I also mapped out for myself my own share in this night's adventurous work.

As soon as I had seen the smugglers safely {{in the hands of}} Leroux and the gendarmes, I would make my way back to St. Cergues as rapidly as I could, step into my vehicle, drive like the <b>wind</b> <b>back</b> to Gex, and place myself at the disposal of my fair angel and her afflicted mother.|$|E

Then on he bounded, uttering such dreadful roars that the horses were frightened and grew unmanageable, and he easily outstripped them, and soon reached the gates of the palace. Here he hastily changed himself into a bee, and flew straight into the princess's room, where he became a man again. She showed him where the sword hung concealed behind a curtain, and he took it down, saying as he did so: 'Be sure not to forget what you have promised to do.' ...|$|E

Shivering, I remembered the south wall, and went there, since to escape from the wind and bask like some half-frozen serpent or lizard in the heat was the highest good one could look for in such weather. To see anything new in wild life was not to be hoped for.|$|E

She’s certainly jolly, and quite all right as far as looks go, and I believe a certain amount of money adheres to her. What I don’t see is how you will ever manage to propose to her. In all the time I’ve known her I don’t remember her to have stopped talking for three consecutive minutes. You’ll have to race her six times round the grass paddock for a bet, and then blurt your proposal out before she’s got her <b>wind</b> <b>back.</b> The paddock is laid up for hay, but if you’re really in love with her you won’t let a consideration of that sort stop you, especially as it’s not your hay.” ...|$|E
