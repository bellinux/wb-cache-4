40|$|ABSTRACT The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the water distribution from a medium-size sprinkler working in solid set sprinkler systems. Water distribution radial curves from the sprinkler operating under four nozzle diameter combinations (4. 0 x 4. 6; 5. 0 x 4. 6; 6. 2 x 4. 6 and; 7. 1 x 4. 6 mm) and four working pressures (196; 245; 294 and 343 kPa) were evaluated on the sprinkler test bench of the State University of Maringá, in Cidade Gaúcha, Paraná, Brazil. The sixteen water distribution curves were normalized and subjected to clustering analysis (K-Means algorithm), identifying the occurrence of normalized distribution curves with three different geometric shapes. A computer algorithm, in Visual Basic for Applications in Excel spreadsheet, was developed to simulate the water application uniformity (Christiansen's Coefficient - CU) from the sprinklers working with rectangular and triangular layouts in solid set sprinkler systems. For the three geometric shapes of the normalized water distribution curves, digital simulation results of water distribution uniformity for the sprinklers on mainline and lateral line spaced between 10 to 100 % of <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> indicated that sprinkler spacings around 50 % of the <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> provide acceptable CU values...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pitch of the}} pillars and impact {{velocity}} are studied for the impact dynamics of a microliter water droplet on a micropillared hydrophobic surface. The results are presented qualitatively by the high-speed photography and quantitatively by the temporal variation of <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> and droplet height. A characterization of the transient quantitative results is a novel aspect of our work. Three distinct regimes, namely, non-bouncing, complete bouncing and partial bouncing are presented. A critical pitch as well as impact velocity exists for the transition from one regime to another. This is explained with a demonstration of Cassie to Wenzel wetting transition in which the liquid penetrates in the grooves between the pillars at larger pitch or impact velocity. The regimes are demarcated on a map of pitch and impact velocity. A good agreement is reported between the present measurements and published analytical models.

Results obtained for CU and DU showed that imported sprinklers had significantly higher water application uniformities than locally made sprinklers at 250 - 350 kPa pressure range. Sprinkler spacings of 12 m x 18 m and 15 m x 15 m passed the layout tests and can be used in Zimbabwe under moderate wind conditions at 300 kPa, using preferably imported sprinklers for best water application uniformity. Therefore 15 m x 15 m sprinkler spacing which covers alarger area can replace 12 m x 18 m layout in spraylines design without compromising water application uniformity...|$|E

40|$|Maximizing {{irrigation}} efficiency is of enormous importance for irrigators in the Central Great Plains to conserve water and reduce pumping costs. High temperatures, frequently strong winds and low humidity increase the evaporation potential of water applied through sprinkler irrigation. Thus, many newer sprinkler packages {{have been developed}} to minimize water losses by evaporation and drift. These systems have the potential to reduce evaporation losses as found by Schneider and Howell (1995). Schneider and Howell found that evaporation losses could be reduced by 2 - 3 % as compared to above canopy irrigation. Many producers and irrigation companies have promoted placing sprinklers within the canopy to conserve water by reducing the exposure of the irrigation water to wind. However, runoff losses can increase as the application rate exceeds the soil infiltration capacity with a reduced <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> of the spray pattern within the canopy.

40|$|The {{transient}} response of a millimeter-sized sessile droplet under electrical actuation is experimentally investigated. Under dc actuation, the droplet spreading rate increases as the applied voltage is increased {{due to the}} higher electrical forces induced. At sufficiently high dc voltages, competition between the electrical actuation force, droplet inertia, the retarding surface tension force and contact line friction leads to droplet oscillation. The timescale for the droplet to attain its maximum <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> during step actuation is analyzed. Systematic experiments are conducted over a frequency range of 5 – 200 Hz and actuation voltages of 40 – 80 Vrms to determine the dependence of droplet oscillation on these parameters. The response of the droplet to different actuation frequencies and voltages is determined {{in terms of its}} contact angle and contact radius variation. The frequency of the driving force (equal to twice the frequency of the applied electrical signal) determines the mode of oscillation of the droplet which, together with its resonance characteristics, governs whether the droplet contact angle and contact radius vary in phase or out of phase with each other. In addition to the primary frequency response at the electrical forcing frequency, the droplet oscillation exhibits sub-harmonic oscillation at half of the forcing frequency that is attributed to the parametric nature of the electrical force acting on the triple contact line of the droplet...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe drying of a drop {{deposited}} on a solid substrate {{has been the}} subject of several investigations including biomedical and forensic fields. These studies also focus on the complex final drop pattern observed at the end of the evaporation process. Our experimental work aims to investigate the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the spreading behavior and on the pattern formation of a dried drop of whole blood at the end of the evaporation process. A range of RH between 13. 5 % and 78. 0 % is studied. Drops of blood of same volume are gently {{deposited on}} ultraclean microscope glass substrates. A top-view camera allows for the monitoring of the drying regime (deposition, gelation and fracturation). We show that RH influences the contact angle, and the final <b>wetting</b> <b>diameter</b> and consequently, the final deposition pattern at the end of the evaporation process. A good agreement has been observed between our results for whole blood and the experimental work of Chhasatia et al. [Appl. Phys.

40|$|Field {{water balance}} {{measurements}} using monolithic lysimeters {{were used in}} validating the Cupid-DPE model for predicting water loss partitioning during sprinkler irrigation from a moving lateral system fitted with impact sprinklers and spray nozzles. The model combines equations governing water droplet evaporation and droplet ballistics with a comprehensive plant-environment energy balance model. Comparisons indicate good agreement between measured and modeled transpiration, and the measured and modeled soil evaporation during the day of irrigation. Total predicted evapotranspiration during the day of irrigation was greater than measured totals using the monolithic lysimeters. However, part of this difference was because the lysimeters could not measure water use during irrigation. Total measured and predicted evapo-transpiration agreed well for the day following irrigation. Predicted soil evaporation rates matched well for the period immediately following irrigation, and cumulative soil evaporation was nearly identical to the measured total {{through the end of}} the next day. During irrigation, the main water loss was shifted from transpiration to evaporation of the wetted-canopy. For equal application volumes, the duration of this effect was greater using impact sprinklers due to the greater <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> and lower average application rate compared to spray nozzles. Predicted water flux rates during irrigation were up to 50 % greater for canopy evaporation than for transpiration rates predicted immediately prior to the start of irrigation. Canopy evaporation amounted to 69 % and 63 % of the total predicted water use during impact and spray irrigation, respectively. It also was 0. 69 and 0. 28 mm greater, respectively, than the predicted transpiration total during this same time span assuming no irrigation had been applied. About 13 and 5 % of the water applied by overhead sprinkling was evaporated or transpired during impact and spray irrigation, respectively. However, the net increase in predicted water loss during irrigation was only 5. 8 % and 2. 4 % of the irrigated water depth applied for the impact and spray cases, respectively, because transpiration and soil evaporation would have occurred even without irrigation. Although droplet evaporation represented less than 1 % of the total water loss for the day using either type of sprinkler, irrigation water did influence the energy transfer between the plant-environment and water droplets during flight, on the canopy, and the soil...|$|E
40|$|Objective of Research The {{interest}} in crop modelling started since the introduction and popularisation of computer technology, which facilitated the dynamic simulation of complex natural systems. In particular, crop growth and soil water balance models for irrigation scheduling are popular at locations where {{water is a}} limiting factor for crop production. In a Water Research Commission project, the soil water balance model (SWB) for irrigation scheduling under full and deficit irrigation was made available. The SWB model is a relatively simple generic crop growth model based on sound physical and physiological principles, (i. e. mechanistic) using daily climatic inputs for daily time-step calculations of the soil-plant-atmosphere water balance to estimate plant growth water use. The SWB model was primarily developed for predicting real-time soil water deficit of field crops with a one-dimensional canopy light interception and water redistribution procedure. Hedgerow tree crops are planted in widely spaced rows to allow access between trees to carry out necessary management practices (e. g. pest control and harvesting). Distribution of energy is not uniform in widely spaced crops. In addition, localised under tree irrigation is often used for tree crops to reduce system installation costs. This irrigation (micro- or drip) only wets a limited area under the canopy of the trees so that evaporation from the soil surface is also not uniform. One can expect root density to vary with depth {{as well as with}} distance between the rows so water uptake for transpiration will also vary in two dimensions. It is also essential {{to take into account the}} limited volume of soil wetted under micro-irrigation. If this is not done, the soil capacity will be incorrectly estimated with a standard one-dimensional approach, leading to undesirable over-irrigation in the wetted zone, as well as possible crop stress resulting from a too long an irrigation interval. In order to accurately estimate canopy growth, water balance and yield, it is therefore essential to model canopy radiant interception and soil water balance of hedgerow tree crops in two dimensions and on an hourly time step, based on sound physical principles. Lack of suitable user-friendly tools to mechanistically describe the two-dimensional energy and soil water balance of tree crops was identified. Due to the importance of fruit crops, on the export as well as local markets, as well as the encouraging results from the initial SWB model, it was decided to improve the SWB model by incorporating a two-dimensional system for use in hedgerow plantings. This thesis reports on the methodology developed to monitor the energy and soil moisture differences within various hedgerows through 24 hour cycles and the results obtained, as well as the subsequent use of the results to evaluate the 2 -dimensional water balance model. This research was an integral, but independent, part of a larger research thrust, i. e. the development of a two-dimensional fruit tree water balance model that can account for the unique fractional interception of solar radiation associated with hedgerow orchards as opposed to the horizontal planar interception encountered in agronomic crops. The primary objective of this thesis is not the actual programming and mathematical manipulations of the relevant algorithms but to create a reliable data base and then evaluate the model. The primary objective of this thesis was to evaluate the model for deciduous fruit trees using peaches as an example and evaluate the model for evergreen fruit trees using citrus as an example. Model description In the overall research thrust two types of model, both predicting crop water requirements on a daily time step, were developed for hedgerow tree crops and included in SWB: i) A mechanistic two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference, Richards’ equation based soil water balance model; and ii) An FAO-based crop factor model, with a quasi- 2 D cascading soil water balance model. For the sake of clarity and completeness, the principles of the models are presented in the thesis and are briefly described in this subsection. The first model calculates the two-dimensional energy interception for hedgerow fruit trees, based on solar and row orientation, tree size and shape, as well as leaf area density. The two-dimensional soil water redistribution is calculated with a finite difference solution. The two-dimensional energy interception model assumes leaves to be uniformly distributed within an ellipsoid truncated at its base, and radiation penetrating the canopy is attenuated according to Beer’s law. This geometry is very versatile as many different shapes can be generated. In order to determine the spatial distribution of soil irradiance across the tree row, the canopy path length through which the radiation must travel to reach a certain point on the soil surface is calculated. Radiation can penetrate neighbouring rows, so two rows on either side of the simulated row are considered. Beam or direct radiation and diffuse radiation for the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) and NIR (near-infrared radiation) wavebands are calculated separately, as they interact differently with the canopy. The ratio of actual measured to potential radiation is used to estimate the proportion of direct and diffuse radiation in these two spectral bands. The attenuation of beam radiation by the canopy is strongly dependent on zenith angle, and, for crops planted in rows, azimuth angle and row orientation will also be crucial. Elevation and azimuth angles are calculated from latitude, solar declination that depends on day of year, and time of day. Before the length of canopy through which radiation penetrates can be calculated, azimuth angle needs to be adjusted to take row orientation into account. Input data required to run the two-dimensional canopy interception model are: day of year (DOY), latitude, standard meridian, longitude, daily solar radiation, row width and orientation, canopy height and width, bare stem height and distance from the ground to the bottom of the canopy, extinction coefficient, absorptivity and leaf area density. In order to simulate two-dimensional water movement in the soil, a grid of nodes were established. This divides the soil up into a number of elements. The distances between nodes are selected so that model output can easily be compared to field measured values. Each element has its own physical properties, so this scheme allows variation in soil properties in two dimensions. Symmetry planes are assumed to occur mid-way between two rows on either side of the hedgerow and no water flux is allowed across these planes. The model redistributes water in the soil in two-dimensions using a finite difference solution to Richards’ continuity equation for water flow. The aim is to find the matric potentials, which will cause the mass balance error to be negligible. This is done using the Newton-Raphson procedure. Two lower boundary conditions can be chosen in the model: i) gravity drainage for well-drained soils, and ii) zero-flux lower boundary to simulate an impermeable layer. A precipitation or irrigation in mm is converted to a flux in kg m- 1 s- 1 by dividing the time step and multiplying by the horizontal distance over which the water is distributed. The infiltration does not have to be uniform over the surface. Non-uniform infiltration is especially important in very coarse soils where lateral redistribution is likely to be limited, or in the case of micro-irrigation. As with the infiltration flux, evaporation is multiplied by the horizontal distance over which it occurs in order to get an evaporative flux in kg m- 1 s- 1. Potential vapotranspiration (PET) is calculated from weather data using the Penman-Monteith equation and the maximum crop factor after rainfall occurs. PET is then partitioned at the soil surface into potential evaporation and potential transpiration depending on solar orientation, row direction and canopy size, shape and leaf area density. Crop water uptake (transpiration) can either be limited by atmospheric demand or soil-root water supply. Root densities at different soil depths are accounted for in the calculation of root water uptake. The user can specify root depth and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil. Required inputs for the two-dimensional soil water balance model are: starting and planting dates, altitude, rainfall and irrigation water amounts, as well as maximum and minimum daily temperature. Two points on the water retention function (usually field capacity and permanent wilting point), initial volumetric soil water content and bulk density are required for each soil layer. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity can also be entered as input for each soil layer, or calculated by the model using the water retention curve. Row distance, <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> of micro-jets or drippers, fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil as well as distance of the nodes from the tree row are also required as input. The second, simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach, was developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with limited input data. This model includes a semi-empirical approach for partitioning of aboveground energy, a cascading soil water redistribution that separates the wetted and non-wetted portion of the ground, as well as prediction of crop yields. The FAO-based crop factor procedure was combined with the mechanistic SWB model, thereby still allowing evaporation and transpiration to be modelled separately as supply and demand limited processes. The crop factor model does not grow the canopy mechanistically and therefore the effect of water stress on canopy size is not simulated. The simpler crop factor model should, however, still perform satisfactorily if the estimated canopy cover closely resembles that found in the field. The following input parameters are required to run the FAO-type crop factor model: planting date, latitude, altitude, maximum and minimum daily air temperatures, FAO crop factors and duration of crop stages. The input data required to run the two-dimensional cascading model are rainfall and irrigation amounts, volumetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point, as well as initial volumetric soil water content for each soil layer. Row spacing, <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter,</b> distance between micro-irrigators or drippers and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil are also required. Required input data for yield prediction with the FAO model are FAO stress factors for growing stages and potential yield. Field Trial Evaluation of the model was carried out for a wide range of conditions (row orientation, period of the year and canopy density). For this purpose, two field trials were set up. The first trial was established in a peach (Prunus persica cv Transvaalia) orchard on the lysimeter facilities at Hatfield (Pretoria University experimental farm). This provided a site where detailed observations could be easily recorded to evaluate the SWB model for deciduous trees. The second trial was established in a citrus clementine (Citrus reticulate cv. Nules Clementine) orchard at the Syferkuil experimental farm of the University of the North. This was the site where measured data were collected to evaluate the SWB model for evergreen trees. In both field trials, the following field measurements were carried out and used to evaluate the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model: i) Weather measurements (temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and rainfall). ii) Soil texture, bulk density, penetrometer resistance. iii) Volumetric soil water content with neutron water meter and time domain reflectometry (TDR). iv) Soil matrix potential with heat dissipation sensors. v) Root distribution by taking soil core samples and washing out roots to determine root length. vi) Soil irradiance at different distances from the tree row with tube solarimeters. v) Leaf area index and density with a LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyser. vi) Canopy size and row orientation. In addition, load cell lysimeters were used in the peach orchard at Hatfield in order to measure crop water use. An additional field trial was carried out at the Hatfield experimental station on Leuceaena (Leucaena leucocephela) trees in order to test the two-dimensional radiant interception model for different environmental conditions (tree size and shape as well as row orientation). For the same purpose, two other trials were carried out on two commercial orchards at Brits in Empress Mandarin (Citrus reticulate cv. Empress) and Delta Valencia (Citrus sinensis [L. ] cv. Osbeck) orchards. In these field trials, weather data were recorded, soil irradiance across the row was measured with tube solarimeters, as well as leaf area index and density, canopy size and row orientation. Results The simple, quasi two-dimensional, cascading soil water balance model was calibrated using data from the peach trial at the Hatfield experimental station. In the process, FAO basal crop coefficients (Kcb) were determined for first and second leaf peach trees. The daily crop factor (Kc) was calculated using evapotranspiration measurements from the lysimeters and the grass reference evapotranspiration calculated from weather data. The Kcb values for the various growth stages were determined by fitting an appropriate line through the lower values of Kc, which were taken to reflect the condition where the soil surface was dry (negligible evaporation), subsoil drainage was negligible and there was sufficient water not to restrict transpiration. There was good agreement between predicted and measured daily soil water deficit for water stressed and non-stressed treatments. This was expected since the calibration data came from the trial. Field measurements in Hatfield also indicated that in hedgerow plantings the whole area across the row must be borne in mind when assessing soil water content. The practice of using single or restricted locality measurements, as utilised in agronomic crops, can be misleading in orchards. The reason for this is the effect of the irrigation distribution and rain interception by the canopy, the variation in radiation interception by the canopy across the row, the irradiance reaching the soil surface as the season progresses, the presence of a grass sod or bare soil in the inter-row region and the root density across the row. In both field trials at Hatfield and Syferkuil, it was found that there are significant amounts of roots in the inter-row region and thus this portion of the rooting volume must not be disregarded when assessing the water balance. The two-dimensional energy interception and soil evaporation components were evaluated separately. The crucial interactions between the model components were integrated in the validation of the two-dimensional soil water balance model, which uses the energy interception and soil evaporation sub-models to split evaporation and transpiration. The radiant interception model predictions and the tube solarimeter measured soil irradiance generally gave very good agreement at different distances from the tree row and in different orchards. However, some discrepancies between measurements and model predictions occurred. This was attributed to the presence of trunks and branches shading the tube solarimeters at low leaf area densities, irregularities in the shape of the hedgerow, and nonuniform distribution of leaves within the canopy. In one case the canopy shape differed drastically from that used in the model. The output obtained with the two-dimensional soil water balance model was compared to independent field measurements in order to evaluate the full SWB two-dimensional model. Volumetric soil water content data collected with the TDR system in the peach and citrus orchards were compared to SWB simulations. Results of model simulations done during drying cycles showed that the surface layer predictions were generally very good. However, in certain situations discrepancies between measurements and simulations were observed, in particular, for deeper soil layers. This could have been due to spatial variability of soil properties, as well as soil disturbance during the installation of TDR probes. It is clear that TDR probes can be used in irrigation scheduling to determine crop water use over certain periods. Caution should, however, be exercised in the interpretation of absolute values of volumetric soil water content obtained from the probes. Scenario modelling and sensitivity analyses were carried out by varying some input parameters and observing variations in certain output variables. The aim was to show an application of this tool to identify the most suitable management practice in order to maximise water use efficiency. Two case studies were considered for two “virtual” orchards located at different latitudes and in different climates (Kakamas in the Northern Cape and Stellenbosch in the Western Cape). The results of the scenario simulations indicated that, based on the inputs used, the orchards should be planted in a N-S row orientation, a <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> of 0. 5 m should be applied when the canopy width is 2 m, in order to minimize water losses through evaporation. As the canopy width increased to 3 m, so the <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> should be increased to 1. 5 m. If the <b>wetted</b> <b>diameter</b> is too small, transpiration and thus yield will be reduced. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out for both case studies varying the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil, and observing variations in the output results of evaporation and transpiration. The contribution to crop water uptake from the inter-row volume of soil can be high, in particular under high atmospheric evaporative demand, and this needs to be accounted for in irrigation management in order to maximise rainfall use efficiency in areas of higher summer rainfall. Conclusions and recommendations The methodologies developed to measure the temporal and spatial variation in solar radiation and thus the energy distribution within Hedgerow orchards worked well. The methods used to measure the temporal and spatial variation of the soil water balance also worked well. Thus a very good data set was generated that enabled the sound evaluation of the 2 -D SWB model. Thus one can conclude that the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model that was developed in the overall research thrust and included in the Soil Water Balance irrigation scheduling model worked well. The simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach and a cascading soil water balance, that was also developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with a limited set of input data, also gave very satisfactory results. The FAO-based model and the cascading soil water balance were calibrated for first leaf and second leaf peaches at Hatfield. The two-dimensional model was fully evaluated for deciduous orchards using data obtained in field trials on peaches and Leucaena (Hatfield). For model validation in evergreen citrus orchards, data obtained in field trials set up at the Syferkuil experimental station (University of the North) and on two commercial farms in Brits were used. Irregular trunks and branches could cause inaccuracies in predictions of the energy balance. At low leaf area densities, the shade from trunks and branches is not accounted for in the SWB model. The relative importance of non-symmetric canopy shape as opposed to nonuniform leaf distribution did have an effect but indications where that this was not critical. The major difficulties encountered in the evaluation of the soil water balance were due to spatial variability of soil properties and disturbance of the soil when the water status monitoring sensors were installed. Careful installation is therefore recommended when using sensors that give localised measurements like those used in this study (heat dissipation sensors and TDR probes). The successful evaluation of the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model opens the opportunity to develop a useful yield predictor and productivity efficiency measure if one knows the canopy to fruit ratio. This information could also be useful for fruit colour and internal quality research. As demonstrated with data from the peach trial at Hatfield, soil or cover crops between rows can also have a large effect on the efficient use of rainfall, and this could be further investigated. The biggest contribution of this model is likely to be the quantification of the contribution that rainfall can make to crop water use by taking the non-irrigated inter-row soil reservoir into account. It is recommended to accurately estimate the root fraction in the wetted and nonwetted volume of soil by digging a trench across the row, taking core soil samples and determining root densities. The two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference soil water balance model is expected to be more accurate than the cascading soil water balance, due to the sound physical principles on which it is based. The mechanistic detailed approach could give guidance with respect to the magnitude of errors made by using simpler, more empirical approaches. However, the two-dimensional model will also require more input parameters compared to the simpler cascading model. In particular, the most difficult parameters to determine will be the leaf area density for the radiation energy interception part due to the cost of the instrumentation, and the hydraulic conductivity for the soil part due to the specialised knowledge and scientific equipm...|$|E

40|$|A temperature-dependent dynamic {{contact angle}} as a {{function}} of temperature-dependent surface tension and reference equilibrium contact angle is proposed for modeling of moving contact line flows, in particular, for computations of liquid droplet impingement on a hot solid substrate. The fluid flow in the liquid droplet is described by the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, whereas the heat transfer in the liquid droplet and in the solid substrate is described by the energy equation. The arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach together with the finite element method is used to solve the governing equations in a time-dependent domain. Further, the Marangoni effects are incorporated into the model without evaluating the tangential derivatives of the temperature on the free surface. The effects of temperature-dependent contact angle on the flow dynamics of the droplet and on the heat transfer from the solid substrate into the liquid droplet are studied for different Reynolds numbers, Weber numbers, solid phase Peclet numbers, solid phase initial temperatures and reference equilibrium contact angles. Numerical studies show that the influence of the temperature-dependent contact angle is negligible in partially wetting droplets, whereas the effects on the <b>wetting</b> <b>diameter</b> and on the total heat transfer are 10. 79 % and 7. 36 % respectively in the considered highly wetting and non-wetting droplets.

The main contribution {{of this paper is}} the sensitivity study to a large number of parameters, including physical and numerical parameters of the aerosol model itself. The optical parameters are computed from a size-resolved aerosol model embedded in the POLYPHEMUS system. The methodology is first described, showing that several hypothesis can be made for micro-physical aerosol properties. The simulation is made over one year (2001); statistics and monthly time series for the simulation and AERONET data are used to evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce AOT and vertically averaged SSA fields and their variability. The relation with the uncertainties of measurements is discussed. Then a sensitivity study with respect to the mixing state of the particle, the way to take into account water uptake, numerical parameters and physical parameteriza-tions of the model is carried out. The results indicate that the mixing state of particles has an influence on optical parameters, as well as the computation of the <b>wet</b> <b>diameter.</b> But some physical and numerical parameters associated with the aerosol model itself have even more influence under certain conditions, through the uncertainties on the aerosol chemical composition, and their size distribution...|$|R

Three types of surfaces {{are used in the}} study: polished silicon, nano-structured porous silicon and gold coated polished silicon. Seven different surface temperatures including single phase (non-boiling) and two phase (boiling) conditions are studied. Droplet impact velocity, transient spreading diameter and dynamic contact angle are determined using image processing. Five stages are observed during impingement: initial impact, boiling (if the surface temperature is high enough), near constant <b>wetting</b> <b>diameter</b> evaporation, fast receding contact line evaporation and final dry-out. Results of water and a water based single-wall-carbon-nano-tube (SWCNT) nanofluid impinging on a polished silicon surface are compared to determine effects of nano-particles on impinging dynamics. The data show that the nanofluid exhibits larger spreading velocities, larger spreading diameters and an increase in early stage dynamic contact angle. The results of water impinging on both polished silicon and nano-structured silicon disks are compared to determine effects of the nano-structured surface on impingement dynamics. It is found that the nano-structured surface enhances the heat transfer for evaporative cooling at lower surface temperatures which is indicated by a shorter evaporation time. Ultimately, using nanofluid and nano-structured surface can reduce the total evaporation time up to 37...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe fully {{characterize}} the natural evaporation of human {{drops of blood}} from substrates and substrate-dependent behavior. The heat flux adsorbed by the drops for evaporation is measured {{by means of a}} heat flux meter. A side-view measurement enables access to the drop contact angle, <b>wetting</b> <b>diameter,</b> and initial height. A top-view camera allows for the monitoring of the drying regime (deposition, gelation, and fracturation). This directly measured heat flux is related to the evaporative mass flux obtained from the mass of the drop, and the two show good agreement. Both types of measurements indicate that regardless of the substrate type, there is first a linearly decreasing regime of evaporation when the drop is mostly liquid and a second regime characterized by a sharp decrease. We show that the evaporation dynamics are influenced by the substrate's wettability but not by the substrate's thermal diffusivity. The different regimes of evaporation exhibited by glass and metallic substrates are explained in terms of evaporation fluxes at the drop surface. In the case of wetting drops (below 40 deg), the evaporation flux is very important along the drop periphery and decreases across the interface, whereas in the case of nonwetting drops (about 90 deg), the evaporation flux is almost uniform across the droplet's surface. We show that these different evaporation fluxes strongly influence the drying behavior. In the case of metallic substrates, this enables the formation of a uniform ``glassy skin'' around the droplet surface and, in the case of glass substrates, the formation a skin along the drop periphery with an inward gelation front. This behavior is analyzed in terms of the competition between the drying time and the gel formation time. Unstable drop surfaces were observed at high initial contact angles and are very similar to those of polymer drops. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4006033...|$|R

Therefore there is a large demand for an improved understanding of fog formation and thus improved forecasts. Improved fog forecasts require {{a better understanding of the}} numerous complex mechanisms during the fog life cycle. During winter 2012 / 13 a field campaign called ParisFog aiming at fog research took place at SIRTA (Instrumented Site for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Research). SIRTA is located about 20 km southwest of the Paris city center, France, in a semi-urban environment. In situ activation properties of the prevailing fog were investigated by measuring (1) total and interstitial (non-activated) dry particle number size distributions behind two different inlet systems; (2) interstitial hydrated aerosol and fog droplet size distributions at ambient conditions; and (3) cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentration at different supersaturations (SS) with a CCN counter. The aerosol particles were characterized regarding their hygroscopic properties, fog droplet activation behavior and contribution to light scattering for 17 developed fog events. Low particle hygroscopicity with an overall median of the hygroscopicity parameter, κ, of 0. 14 was found, likely caused by substantial influence from local traffic and wood burning emissions. Measurements of the aerosol size distribution at ambient RH revealed that the critical <b>wet</b> <b>diameter,</b> above which the hydrated aerosols activate to fog droplets, is rather large (with a median value of 2. 6 μm) and is highly variable (ranging from 1 to 5 μm) between the different fog events.

Combining all experimental data, the effective peak supersaturation, SS peak, a measure of the peak supersaturation during the fog formation, was determined.

McMurry. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 160 pages + 1 MPEG file. Aerosol {{particles in the}} presence of a vapor will often change in size and composition due to heterogeneous vapor uptake. The physics and thermodynamics of this phenomenon are not well understood for particles less than ~ 10 nm where traditional models using bulk properties begin to break down. Further, existing methods for measuring/quantifying vapor uptake by particles are not effective for examining particles below 5 nm in size, and at relatively high vapor saturation ratios. This dissertation presents two new methods for measuring vapor uptake by aerosol particles in this size range. Each system measures the change in electrical mobility (which can be related to size) of aerosol particles when they are introduced to a vapor of known concentration. The first system consists of a tandem High Resolution Differential Mobility Analyzer - Drift Tube Ion Mobility Analyzer (HRDMA-DTIMS) for measuring uptake by particles ranging from ~ 2 nm to > 12 nm, and the second system is a tandem HRDMA-Mass Spectrometer for measuring uptake by particles ranging from a single molecule to ~ 2 nm. For the HRDMA-DTIMS system a new drift tube ion mobility spectrometer was developed and is described, with the goal of high resolution and fast measurement times. The device is capable of sub second mobility distribution scans and resolving powers similar to DMAs currently used in similar vapor uptake experiments. Measurement of water vapor uptake by hygroscopic salts of lithium iodide and sodium iodide particles compared to theoretical calculations exposes the flaws in existing vapor uptake models. The precision of the growth factor (<b>wet</b> <b>diameter</b> / dry diameter) measured using this system is shown to be ~ 0. 2 % for the presented data. For the HRDMA-MS system we are able to identify electrospray generated ions of a specific composition and then measure their change in electrical mobility as a function of relative humidity. Using this system we measured vapor uptake by alkyl halide salt cluster ions ranging from one to 27 molecules. We also describe how structures determined using density functional theory can be used to estimate the change in electrical mobility due to additions of vapor molecules. In addition to describing new instrumentation and systems, a model for estimating mobility changes based on collision mechanics as well as thermodynamics of individual molecule uptake is presented. This model can be applied to any vapor uptake measurement systems...|$|R
