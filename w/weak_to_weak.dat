The level of significance (P ≤  0.05, p ≤  0.01) of heavy metals correlation for soil samples was determined and the results were given in Table  2. The Pearson correlation (r) values showed that there is strong negative correlation and statistically significant relation between depth of soil sample and soil organic matter within study area. There is also weak to moderate correlation between service year (year of establishment) of garage and heavy metals under investigation.

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the ability of large-volume cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to detect horizontal root fracture and to test the influence of a metallic post. Methods: Through the examination of 40 teeth by large-volume CBCT (20 -cm height and 15 -cm diameter cylinder) at 0. 2 -mm voxel resolution, 2 observers analyzed the samples for the presence and localization of horizontal root fracture. Results: The values of accuracy in the groups that had no metallic post ranged from 33 %- 68 %, whereas for the samples with the metallic post, values showed a wide variation (38 %- 83 %). Intraobserver agreement showed no statistically significant difference between the groups with/without metallic post; both ranged from very <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> <b>weak</b> (kappa, 0. 09 - 0. 369). Conclusions: The low accuracy and low intraobserver and interobserver agreement reflect the difficulty in performing an adequate diagnosis of horizontal root fractures through a large-volume CBCT by using a small voxel reconstruction.

Several reports had speculated into the probable relationships of Vtg with reproductive phenotype of Philippine Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus L.). Hence, it was hypothesized to use the Vtg profile as a nonlethal physiological index of reproductive performance in Philippine Mallard duck. Forty ducks, aged 16 weeks old, were randomly assigned into two treatment groups: 20 ducks fed with 30 ppm zinc-diet (zinc positive) and 20 ducks fed with no added zinc (zinc negative). All ducks were kept individually in cages. The circulating Vtg at sexual maturity (155. 11 ± 10. 83 days old) was determined from the blood sera. The sera were assayed for Vtg in duplicate using 96 -well microplate and the optical density was read at 415 nm. Results show that the circulating Vtg in the blood sera of ducks at sexual maturity was 0. 69 ± 0. 07 µg Zn/dl.

This study aimed to assess the degree {{of awareness}} {{of the people of the}} cities of Gorgan, Gonbad, and Aliabad Katool (Iran) in relation to municipal solid waste management. Materials and methods:  In this descriptive-periodic study in 2012, a questionnaire with a Cronbach's alpha of 0. 78 was used. 550 questionnaires were completed: 200 in different areas of the city of Gorgan, 240 in different areas of the city of Gonbad, and 110 in different areas of the city of Aliabad Katool. Data were analyzed by SPSS software. Results: The awareness of the citizens in the studied cities in the area of waste-related diseases and the waste effect on the environment was satisfactory. The rate of citizens ' awareness in the field of recycling and ways of reduction of household waste and the methods of waste disposal was above the average.

40|$|The soft {{sedimentary}} {{deposits of}} the Waitemata Group which outcrop {{on the eastern}} coastline of the Auckland region are a coastal cliff erosion hazard. The determination of the rate that these cliffs erode for hazard zonation purposes still requires research. A database has been collated {{of a range of}} structural, geological, geomorphic and climate parameters from 16 representative cliff sites in order to statistically assess what parameters influence cliff erosion and why erosion rates vary within the relatively uniform geology. Four different lithological units have been defined: sandstone beds of turbidites; sandstone beds of densites (contain rip-up clasts); sand to gravel beds of debrites; and siltstone beds. Cliff rock has very <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> <b>weak</b> intact rock strength; apertures of 0. 1 to 15 mm; infill types are soft clay and grit, and hard calcite and iron; spacing of discontinuities are smaller in siltstone beds (≥ 5 mm), and up to 5 m in sandstone and debrite beds; bedding and fault planes are continuous, joints are non-continuous; block size is dictated by bed thickness and non-continuous joints. Shore platform widths were used to determine long-term erosion rates which range from 1. 2 to 53. 0 mm y- 1. Platform morphologies are either sloping or horizontal or are a combination of both. Higher platform benches found at some sites are considered {{to be the result of}} a higher period of sea-level or are high-tide benches. Intact and rock mass strength increases northwards. Cliff heights are 8 to 38 m; cliff angles are 51 to 79. Conditions for sporadic planar and wedge failure were determined at some sites; frittered siltstone and low durability sandstone allow smaller-scale, continual erosion. Castor Bay, Army Bay, Waiwera Beach and Leigh Marine Reserve have the lowest rock mass quality. Musick Point, Narrowneck Beach and Waiake Bay have good rock mass quality. A conceptual model for coastal cliff erosion has been developed for Waitemata Group coastal cliffs, based on the dominant processes that act on the cliffs determined from statistical analysis (student t-test, correlation and regression) and field observations. The primary factor for cliff erosion is bed dip, whereby seaward dipping beds have higher erosion rates than landward dipping beds. The secondary factors for cliff erosion include: the intact and rock mass strength of the rock; the rock mass quality; strength of the siltstone beds; strength and structure of the sandstone beds; and orientation of the bedding planes with respect to the cliff face. Shear stresses are enhanced when beds dip seaward and thus shear failure along continuous surfaces is achievable. When beds dip landward the influence of shear stresses along bedding planes, and their contribution to the removal of individual blocks of rock, is severely inhibited resulting in reduced rates of erosion. There is no relationship between cliff height and erosion rates and cliff heights are mainly controlled by the pre-existing landscape. Cliff angle is controlled by the proportion of sandstone and siltstone (whereby lower cliff angles are more siltstone-dominated), rock mass strength and weathering. Erosion rates do vary in Waitemata Group rock of the Auckland region because of the variation in structural and geomorphic conditions of the cliff, most strongly controlled by the dip angle of bedding planes...|$|E
