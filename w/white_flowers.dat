5|$|Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily recognisable and has hollow stems with small <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> that are produced in late summer. Other non-native {{species on the}} island include the Colorado beetle, burnet rose and oak processionary moth.|$|E
5|$|Near Wheddon Cross is Snowdrop Valley, {{which becomes}} filled with {{thousands}} of little <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> called snowdrops during early spring. Within the valley is a sawmill, formerly powered by the River Avill, which runs through the valley.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{species of}} Perovskia are recognized. P.abrotanoides shares {{much of the}} range of P.atriplicifolia, but is {{distinguished}} by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids between these two species may occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in its native range, P.scrophularifolia is less upright; some forms have <b>white</b> <b>flowers.</b> The flowers of P.scabiosifolia are yellow.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} in rich, mixed upland forests. It is easily {{recognised}} by its attractive three-petaled <b>white</b> <b>flowers,</b> opening from late spring to early summer, that rise above a whorl of three, leaf-like bracts. It {{is an example of}} a spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is synchronised with that of the deciduous woodland which it favours.|$|E
5|$|During a 12-day {{trade mission}} in Asia, Daniels visited Indiana {{soldiers}} {{serving on the}} border of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. On the 56th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, he laid a bouquet of <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> {{at the base of a}} plaque listing 900 soldiers from Indiana who died in the war. During the visit he met with Asian auto executives and successfully promoted the expansion of facilities in Indiana.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E

50|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Flower</b> was a 1923 American silent romantic drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Julia Crawford Ivers and starring Betty Compson and Edmund Lowe. Ivers' son, James Van Trees, was the film's cinematographer. Set in Hawaii, the film was shot on location in Honolulu. The <b>White</b> <b>Flower</b> is now considered lost.|$|R
50|$|The Famine is also commemorated in song, {{both from}} the period and from modern times. Irish novelist and songwriter, Brendan Graham has written a number of novels and songs on An Gorta Mor - the Great Irish Famine. His book {{publishing}} deal with Harper Collins originated {{from a number of}} songs he had written about An Gorta Mor, resulting in the publication of his best selling 'documentary novel' of the Famine - The <b>Whitest</b> <b>Flower</b> (HarperCollins, London, Sydney, Toronto, 1998). The Sunday Times, Canberra called The <b>Whitest</b> <b>Flower</b> - 'An important addition to the Irish national story'. The <b>Whitest</b> <b>Flower,</b> with its song 'soundtrack', was a required text for Boston's MIT Women's Studies Course. Along with its sequel The Element of Fire (HarperCollins, 2001), The <b>Whitest</b> <b>Flower</b> was also listed as 'support fiction' for Ireland's Leaving Certificate, History syllabus.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially <b>white</b> <b>flowers,</b> indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the <b>white</b> <b>flowers.</b> Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{floral emblem}} for its {{home state of}} New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.|$|E
5|$|The largest area of {{production}} {{is also the}} Netherland, with 76% of the global cultivated area, followed by France, Chile, Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether. About half of the commercial production is for cut flowers. Many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market. The Netherland produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important crop is the production of Lilium longiflorum, whose <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> are associated with purity and Easter.|$|E
40|$|Enzymic {{antioxidants}} {{were analyzed}} in both blue <b>flowered</b> leaf and <b>white</b> <b>flowered</b> leaf of Clitoria ternatea. The in vitro model {{used in the}} study as alternatives to live animals, was goat liver slices. The liver slices exposed to different treatments were incubated for one hour at 37 ˚C with very mild shaking. The enzymic antioxidant activity was analyzed by using goat liver slices, both blue <b>flowered</b> leaf and <b>white</b> <b>flowered</b> leaf of Clitoria ternatea and H 2 O 2 as oxidant. The results showed that the <b>white</b> <b>flowered</b> leaves had higher content of all the enzymic antioxidants analyzed than the blue flower...|$|R

5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} on a {{sofa with}} her head rested on her hand, while Jones is seated on the floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} shows a fictive Flemish city. As in the diptych in New York, some {{buildings and}} landmarks {{can be identified}} with Jerusalem. It closely resembles {{the background of the}} Rolin panel, which has undergone much deeper attention from scholars, with a number of identifications made with structures in Jerusalem, including the Mosque of Omar, known to van Eyck through second-hand textual and visual descriptions. People and animals populate the city walls, but some are only visible under magnification in the Philadelphia painting. The lake by the city shows a boat whose shadow is reflected in the water. Reflective water surfaces were another typical Eyckian innovation, one he seems to have mastered early, evidenced by the water scenes in the Turin-Milan Hours, and which requires a considerable degree of artistry. Plants consist of tiny foreground flowers, larger mid-ground grasses and background bushes and trees. The small carpet of <b>white</b> <b>flowers</b> in the foreground is reminiscent of those in the Ghent Altarpieces central panel; behind Francis are dwarf palms.|$|E
