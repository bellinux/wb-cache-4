5000|$|Waffle, or {{sometimes}} honeycomb fabric, is fabric, usually cotton or microfibre, woven {{in a way}} which makes it very absorbent. The <b>waffle</b> <b>weave</b> also allows air to flow through the towel so that it dries quickly. Waffle fabrics are made in a range of weights.|$|E
5000|$|Waffle: Waffle fabric {{has good}} water absorbency, is loose {{and has a}} {{distinctive}} [...] "gridlike" [...] appearance. For most part, these bathrobes are designed for their light weight. [...] "Pique" [...] {{is a type of}} <b>waffle</b> <b>weave</b> that can be applied to cotton, velour, silk, and other fabrics.|$|E
50|$|Variations do not appreciably {{alter the}} badge's {{appearance}} or design. Two types of variations include positional changes and stitching changes. These are often caused by manufacturing variations and not classified separately. However, some variations have attained notoriety, {{such as the}} <b>waffle</b> <b>weave</b> variation found among Type C badges and the large people vs. slender people variations among Family Life badges. Such variations were very common up until the 1940s and still occur, though not as often. Collectors find these variations interesting and collect such badges. Examples of positional shifts among the objects comprising the motif of a merit badge include changes in the precise positioning of the tent and the mountains among Camping Type H merit badges.|$|E
40|$|Most {{people might}} not reflect upon {{textiles}} as anything more than the soft material in our clothes. As a crafts practitioner, I gain knowledge of woven materials that go beyond that. The knowledge of weaving and materials is developing the ideas that form the concept of this project. From the tacit knowledge, derived from years of practically working with textile materials, an intellectual understanding of materials and the worlds they construct is growing. In this project, I decipher my own ideas of the woven structure in order to invite others to experience the universe within textiles. I look at the weave as a structure, built up by small particles in forms of threads. If seeing the weave from a distance, each repeated pattern can in turn be perceived as the smallest element. By seeing woven materials {{from more than one}} perspective, I believe that the understanding of the construction itself can develop. As this understanding grows, so does the ability to judge the quality of the material. In this line of thought, the tools used to reflect upon what materials are, how they are made and what they signify, becomes greater. To visualise the knowledge I have of the textile structures I make, I work with a <b>waffle</b> <b>weave</b> structure, together with a dyeing technique called Ikat. I also draw connections between the woven structure and that of a map – as a tool that humans use to understand their surroundings. The use of perspectives and scale is another tool that is used to widen our perception of the world around us. In order to create an experience of the universe within textiles and to invite others into that world, I draw parallels between the miniature scale of the woven material and larger, architectural structures. The final outcome of this project is a textile installation, consisting of three weavings that together form a larger construction. The construction is open for people to enter and experience. Inside the construction a smaller woven piece is presented as a map over the woven world. This weaving initially contains the same information as the large structure, but on a much smaller scale.

40|$|In my work I am {{concerned}} with the general concepts of movement and change and specifically with the profoundness {{of the idea that}} we are touched by fiber from the moment of birth until the moment of death. This accessibility of textiles combined with the vast historical foundation of textiles allows for abundant exploration as an artist. In her book, On Weaving, Anni Albers (1965) defines weaving as 2 ̆ 2 the making of a pliable plane 2 ̆ 2 (19). She further describes six structures used to create this pliable plane. They are interlacing (which we normally think of as weaving), plaiting or braiding, looping, knotting, twisting or twining, and matting or felting (Albers, 1965, p. 19). I embrace this definition of weaving because it describes the physicality of the textile itself, the process of making the textile, and the broad focus of weaving. DESCRIPTION OF WORKSUsing structures found in old dishtowels, a series of works titled 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 explores everyday events {{in the life of a}} dishtowel. Because dishtowels are used in many ways other than drying dishes, torn edges, stained areas, and twisted fibers communicate these possibilities. 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Fragment 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Towel 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness <b>waffle</b> <b>weave</b> structures; 2 ̆ 2 Twill Towel 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Twill Fragment 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness twill structures, all common structures found in dishtowels. Linen fibers painted with inks before interlacing work to create an integration of surface and structure to enhance the meanings of these humble textiles. 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 (Figure 1) illustrates these techniques. The series 2 ̆ 2 Deadhead 2 ̆ 7 s Straight Wardrobe 2 ̆ 2 uses the paper making process. This process mats cotton linter fibers and bonds them together with pressure. The paper doll image is used as a vehicle to explore the ordinary man 2 ̆ 7 s shirt and comment on how quickly a personal image can be changed and how superficial that change can be. The paper doll image works as a visual vehicle to facilitate these quick-change possibilities. The male shirt was chosen because it is less commonly thought of as an image maker. Questions are raised and visual comments on gender issues are made. The surface image is literal in that the color and mixed media are visually on the surface of the handmade paper; although structurally, they are part of the paper making process. The matting/felting process is used; cotton linter, dyes, pigments, and mixed media are used to create these works...|$|E
