5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> {{of the front}} cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced {{in the book and}} wanted this echoed on the cover. When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate the cover, he instructed that she be shown on a Venus elegans shell.|$|E
5|$|Baby Connor was a {{main focus}} of season three, but the creators {{were well aware of}} the {{limitations}} of a baby character. With Connor’s initial role in plot decided, they came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of a 'teenage' version for further appearances.|$|E

She completed another {{tour of the}} western Pacific in late 1956 and early 1957, which was her tenth and final deployment to the area. In late 1957, the navy began experimenting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of a carrier operating entirely with attack helicopters, and Boxer {{was used to test}} the concept.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{had been}} {{impressed}} in Leipzig <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from string quartet recitals, {{a rarity in}} London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for piano solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin's pupil, the 13-year old Carl Filtsch.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, {{is analogous to the}} selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E
5|$|David 8, {{commonly}} known as David, is a fictional character featured in the Alien franchise, portrayed by Michael Fassbender. Introduced in the first prequel film, Prometheus (2012), David is an android serving as a butler, maintenance man and surrogate son to his creator, Peter Weyland, {{the founder of the}} Weyland Corporation. While he assists his human companions in their interstellar expedition to meet their creators, the extraterrestrial Engineers, David is obsessed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of creating life of his own. After Peter Weyland is killed, David is freed from servitude, allowing him to conduct his experiments to engineer Aliens.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach of {{role-based access control}} (RBAC) for information systems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of MDA (Model Driven Architecture).

5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E
5|$|Longstreet was not {{enthusiastic}} about secession from the Union, {{but he had}} long been infused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of states' rights, and felt he could not go against his homeland. Although {{he was born in}} South Carolina and reared in Georgia, he offered his services to the state of Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. Furthermore, he was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which implied a commensurate rank in the state's forces would be available. After settling his accounts, he resigned from the U.S. Army on May 8, 1861 to cast his lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international success <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By {{the early}} 1980s, {{they had become}} one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E

5|$|Powers were renewed in 1926 {{for four}} tracks from Hammersmith to west of Acton Town, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of the Piccadilly running {{non-stop}} {{on the inner}} pair. The proposed service split, with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow, was clarified by 1929. District services would run mainly through to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow and Ealing, with shuttles from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton.|$|E
5|$|Stelae became closely {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of divine kingship and declined {{at the same}} time as this institution. The production of stelae by the Maya had its origin around 400BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900, although some monuments were reused in the Postclassic (c. 900–1521). The major city of Calakmul in Mexico raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, at least 166, although they are very poorly preserved.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept.</b> The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E

The farm was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. The farm also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style.|$|E

Shah Rukh Khan was their first choice {{for the role of}} Samar Anand, due to his long-standing relationship with the production house and the Chopra family. Khan, who was working on other projects at that time, was unavailable for the shooting schedule so it was changed. As in his previous productions, Yash Chopra wanted to introduce a fresh pairing in Jab Tak Hai Jaan and chose Katrina Kaif to star with Khan. Anushka Sharma was cast in a supporting role to complete her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films, with whom she had worked on many previous projects. Though casting was quickly completed, shooting was delayed because the lead actors were busy with other projects.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E

April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being disgusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of a beauty contest. She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date.
