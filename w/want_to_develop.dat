5|$|Nima Nourizadeh had {{previously}} only worked directing music videos and commercials, {{but he came}} to the producers' attention for his directing work on a series of party-themed Adidas commercials. Nourizadeh explained to the producers how he would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the script and how he would want the film to look and feel, and he was eventually brought from London to Los Angeles, for what he believed would be two weeks, but stretched to two years. Phillips believed that Nourizadeh's interpretation of the film was compatible with his vision, influencing the decision to hire Nourizadeh in his feature film debut.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the National Film Development Corporation in 1981. Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> films, however {{the criteria for}} obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which {{in the past two}} decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.|$|E

In fact, the role was written specifically with Morgan in mind. In the original script, the babies were born with wings instead of tails.

In fact, the role was written specifically with Morgan in mind, as Gilligan had seen Morgan acting in a student film he made at Loyola Marymount University and considered him a funny actor.|$|E
500|$|Because Linx {{was only}} to operate {{profitable}} routes, {{it was decided that}} the company not take over the night train service from Oslo to Copenhagen. NSB stated that they wanted all inter-Scandinavian passenger transport to be operated by the new company, and therefore decided to terminate the night train as of September 2. Although the night trains were filled during the summer and parts of the winter, there was a low ridership {{during the rest of the}} year. However, it was a lack of engineers that forced NSB to terminate the night train service as of 20 June. There were protests against the ending of the service, particularly in Norway. Marketing Director Øyvind Rørslett of Linx stated that [...] "we are concentrating on the day trains. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a holistic concept, where new modern trains are a major part. Night trains do not fit into this concept".|$|E

500|$|In Buddhist texts {{further details}} {{are given in}} what way {{and to what extent}} a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual {{attitude}} of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given. If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a [...] (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order. If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions. Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually [...] "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around. Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit. Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose. The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard {{to the size of the}} gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size. It is therefore recommended to give as much as you can afford, no more and no less. Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (...) [...]|$|E

2500|$|Triumph {{set up an}} {{assembly}} facility in Speke, Liverpool in 1959, gradually increasing {{the size of the}} company's most modern factory {{to the point that it}} could produce 100,000 cars per year. However, only a maximum of 30,000 cars was ever produced as the plant was never put into full production use, being used largely as {{an assembly}} plant. During the 1960s and '70s Triumph sold a succession of Michelotti-styled saloons and sports cars, including the advanced Dolomite Sprint, which, in 1973, already had a 16-valve four-cylinder engine. It is alleged that many Triumphs of this era were unreliable, especially the 2.5 PI (petrol injection) with its fuel injection problems. In Australia, the summer heat caused petrol in the electric fuel pump to vapourise, resulting in frequent malfunctions. [...] Although the injection system had proven itself in international competition, it lacked altitude compensation to adjust the fuel mixture at altitudes greater than [...] above sea level. The Lucas system proved unpopular: Lucas did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> it further, and Standard-Triumph dealers were reluctant to attend the associated factory and field-based training courses.|$|E

[...] Stugotz also felt a good use of [...] "Wake and Take" [...] was to interview Mike Ryan. [...] The opening of Wake and Take is known to be masterfully produced; it is a decidedly not-irritating, explosion of audio stimulation that rarely fails to remind the listener of The Ticket's phone-in line number. [...] It is important during [...] "Wake and Take" [...] to give quick, [...] "hot takes" [...] on anything, but any greeting towards the hosts will result in [...] "Suey!" [...] and dropping/hanging up on the call. [...] Dan attempts to fit in (instead of fitting out) during this hour, usually poorly, and has occasionally attempted to get the local hour back to its previous format. These however usually fail, resulting in Dan leaving the studio altogether and Wake and Take resuming.|$|E
