While correct, such statements commonly lead readers of papers (and not infrequently the authors themselves) to conclude that despite an investigation aimed at uncovering evidence there is no evidence for an effect. Authors and readers may then go on to conclude that the lack of evidence indicates that there is no effect. In this respect, Pilling et al. [5] were correct to assert that given that formal analysis of their data “would lack the power to detect anything other than very large treatment effects”, a formal analysis “would be potentially misleading”.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} is {{proposed}} to generate pitch-contours for Mandarin speech synthesis. In this method, an HMM (hidden Markov model) {{is used to}} model the pro-sodic states implicitly stayed, and a syllable’s pitch-contour is treated as an observation generated from a prosodic state. Such an HMM is called a syllable pitch-contour HMM (SPC-HMM). For training the SPC-HMM, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> developed a feasible method to nor-malize a pitch-contour’s height. After normalization, each training syllable’s pitch-contour is vector quantized and represented with a VQ (vector quantization) code. Then, the VQ code and its adjacent syllables’lexical tones are combined to define an observation symbol for training the SPC-HMM. In the synthesis phase, a sentence-wide most probable observation symbol sequence is searched on the SPC-HMM by using a dynamic programming algorithm proposed here. Then, the observation symbol found for a syllable is decoded to obtain its pitch-contour VQ code. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>conducted</b> testing ex-periments to determine {{the size of a}} pitch-contour codebook and the number of states for an SPC-HMM. The results indicate that setting the codebook size to eight and using six states are the better choices. Also, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>conducted</b> perception tests to compare the naturalness levels of synthetic speech files. The results show that the two generation modes, for operating an SPC-HMM, studied here are comparable to each other in natu-ralness level...|$|R
