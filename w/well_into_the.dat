5|$|After the 1650s, Monteverdi's name quickly disappears from {{contemporary}} accounts, his music generally forgotten {{except for the}} Lamento, prototype of a genre that would endure <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 18th century.|$|E

50|$|According to Graham Wallas, Wells's {{delivery}} of his lecture was too rapid, {{but it was}} well received {{and contributed to the}} rapid integration of <b>the</b> 35-year-old <b>Wells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> literary and intellectual elite of London in 1902.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, the Canadian company Gastem, {{which had}} been {{drilling}} gas <b>wells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Utica Shale in Quebec, drilled {{the first of its}} three state-permitted Utica Shale wells in New York. The first well drilled was in Otsego County.|$|R

5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.|$|E

50|$|The Long Lake upgrader uses SAGD {{to extract}} bitumen from the {{underground}} oil sands. The process involves using two separate horizontal <b>wells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reservoir. One <b>well</b> {{is used to}} inject steam, which reduces the viscosity of the bitumen. The previously stable bitumen then drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> second <b>well,</b> which extracts it to the surface.|$|R

50|$|Before using {{electrochemical}} {{techniques and}} etching depression <b>wells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> base semiconductor crystal material, a heated diffused phosphorus gaseous layer is created {{over the entire}} intrinsic semiconductor base crystal, creating a N-type graded base semiconductor material.

The Borad, an evil ruler, accidentally becomes half-Morlox before the episode.|$|R
25|$|Drilling of <b>wells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} aquifer by the Palestinians is restricted. Most of {{its water}} thus flows underground towards {{the slopes of}} <b>the</b> hills and <b>into</b> Israeli territory. According to different estimates, between 80 and 85% of groundwater in the West Bank is used either by Israeli settlers or flows into Israel.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the Cog Railway ascends is {{straightforward}} from base to summit, the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E

5|$|As Gingrich {{primed for}} another {{run in the}} 1978 elections, Flynt decided to retire. Gingrich {{defeated}} Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes. Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district. He faced a close general election race once—in the House elections of 1990—when he won by 978 votes in a race against Democrat David Worley. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, {{as well as most}} of the area's seats in the General Assembly, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1980s.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{influence}} plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group fell back on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 19thcentury.|$|E
50|$|Water wells for {{the city}} of Olympia were first created in the area now {{comprising}} Watershed Park in the late 19th century. Influential Western Washington businessman Henry Clay Heermans bought the entire waterworks in 1909, and sold it to the City of Olympia in 1917. After operating <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, the city planned to log the area and sell the property, leading to a Washington Supreme Court battle that led to the area's preservation, with a city ordinance protecting the area presently.|$|R

50|$|Pore {{pressure}} gradient is a dimensional petrophysical term used by drilling engineers and mud engineers during {{the design of}} drilling programs for drilling (constructing) oil and gas <b>wells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> earth.
