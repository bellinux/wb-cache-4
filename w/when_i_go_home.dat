2500|$|... "That {{might be}} my longest run ever", Martin (a Pittsburgh native) {{said after the}} game about his 78-yard score. [...] "College, Pop Warner, everything. To me, the Steelers are my second-favorite team. I kind of worry about <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> how infamous I'll be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oah, yes, here! But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> I must conciliate popular superstition, {{and make}} ceremonies of purification, and my women will anoint idols." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall need," [...] he said {{suddenly}} to his Inspector, [...] "about ten couple. I'll get 'em <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> You'll be Whip, Baker?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> to my grandmother, she {{was greatly}} {{surprised}} to see me, and I lost no time in explaining my unexpected appearance.|$|R
60|$|Lettie had not arrived <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home.</b> <b>I</b> put the violets in {{a little}} vase on the table. I remembered he had wanted her to see the drawingsâ€”it was perhaps as well he had kept them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very. I thought Maximus {{had chosen}} {{me for my}} good looks and fine style in marching, but, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> the Pater {{told me he had}} served under Maximus in the great Pict War, and had asked him to befriend me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed; {{but one day}} is so short! It will be stupider {{than ever}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to-night," [...] {{answered}} Jill, looking about her with longing eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My cousin!' {{said the}} Captain; 'he {{will be very}} mortified <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> if I tell him your ladyship speaks of his {{acquaintance}} as one that is past.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She won't {{give me the}} letter. I'm to have it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> for good; and I'm to go {{home for}} good at the holidays," [...] whimpered Janey.|$|E
6000|$|Plunkett faced his {{interlocutor}} with {{a severe}} glance. [...] "I always said," [...] he replied slowly, [...] "that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> I'd send on ahead of me a draft for ten thousand dollars. I always said that, didn't I? Eh? And I said I was goin' home--and I've been home, haven't I? Well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, I said, old Ballhatchet {{could tell}} that I crossed the bridge {{at the very time}} they were doing this pretty piece of work, for he was sitting smoking in his porch <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> and, would you believe it? the old rascal would not {{remember}} who passed that evening! It is all his malice and revenge--nothing else!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{truth was}} that I was simply smiling over some very pretty {{thoughts}} {{that had come to}} me about the roses which were climbing over Mary Gillespie's sill. I meant to inscribe them in the little blank book <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home.</b> Georgie's speech brought me back to harsh realities with a jolt. It hurt me, as such speeches always did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let him laugh; {{it will be}} my turn <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> with a fine cat over my shoulder," [...] thought Corny, tearing along, heedless of falls, scratches, {{and bruised}} knees.|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Paul Hubert. I live over there. And I can't tell {{just what}} I {{saw in the}} sunset, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> I'm going to write it all in my {{foolscap}} book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My uncle," [...] she said, [...] "is {{not likely}} to trouble his head about me. He has {{dispensed}} with my services for the future. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> I am going back to my own people." ...|$|E
60|$|DOYLE. I was seventeen. So was she: if she'd been older she'd {{have had}} more sense than to stay with us. We were {{together}} for 18 months before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> up to Dublin to study. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> for Christmas and Easter, she was there: I suppose {{it used to be}} something of an event for her, though of course I never thought of that then.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have. I did {{not think}} of her until I had pervaded the whole of our neighbourhood, and I don't know that I should have done so then but for finding Mother and Pet, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> full of the idea that Tattycoram must have gone to her. Then, of course, I {{recalled}} what she said that day at dinner when you were first with US.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} what {{happened}} to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> to-day?" [...] she said. [...] "I found my maid waiting in the hall--with everything that belongs to me, packed up for my departure. The girl explained that she had been forced to obey my father's positive orders. I knew what that meant--I had to leave the house, and find a place to live in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} kinds of {{caterpillars}} in America," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that wind their silk up into balls. I mean {{to get some of}} the balls <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and see if I can unwind them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must {{search and}} consider,' said Anne; 'I will hunt him out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> {{and if we}} have a print of him, and if he is tolerably good-looking, I will see what I can do with him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was splendid!" [...] she cried. [...] "I wish I {{was a real}} fairy, {{and always}} lived in this lovely place. Everything will seem so ugly and big and coarse <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> I shall never be happy again." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was what}} he wanted, then,--social recognition. I said nothing, but I saw my opportunity: I had the clew, now, to a certain {{attitude}} he had adopted of late toward me, an attitude of reproach; as though, in return for his many favours to me, there were something I had left undone. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>I</b> asked Maude to call on Mrs. Scherer.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, your sermon last Sunday puzzled me. I could not {{comprehend}} (on your showing) how Paul got that wonderful influence over those pagans which he evidently had; and as how to get influence is a very favourite study of mine, I borrowed the book <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> and read for myself; and the matter at last seemed clear enough, on Paul's own showing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She couldn't {{live more}} handy {{to you than}} she does,' said Riderhood, 'and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> <b>home</b> with you (as of course I am a going), I {{recommend}} you to clean her out without loss of time. You can marry her, arter you and me {{have come to a}} settlement. She's nice-looking, and I know you can't be keeping company with no one else, having been so lately disapinted in another quarter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucy Coulson {{looked at}} him thoughtfully. [...] "Perhaps I did use you rather badly, {{and it might be}} {{possible}} for me to do you a trifling kindness now. Shall I talk to the old man <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> again? I see him often." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not sure; {{he gives}} me all I want; I know that much. I'm {{going to talk to}} him about it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Anyhow, I shall set him a good example;" [...] and Tommy was so serious, that Nat did not dare to laugh, but said, respectfully, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} two left, Terence, {{so we will}} smoke them together, and I have got a bottle of dacent spirits. Think of that, me boy; thirty-two days without spirits! They will never believe me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and tell 'em I went without it for thirty-two mortal days." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{housekeeping}} duties, {{though at}} first it caused me great anxiety {{to think that they}} were unperformed, were soon as far off as the oldest of the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer afternoons <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> from school with my portfolio under my arm, and my childish shadow at my side, to my godmother's house. I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it.|$|R
5000|$|... :The Fingallian Dance c.1650:-:On {{a day in}} the Spring,:As <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to bolring:to {{view the}} jolly Daunciers,:They did trip it so high:(Be me shole!)

6000|$|... "A {{very happy}} one. Yes, I owe {{to that kind}} soul and her little story, the turn that Fortune gave her wheel. Nay, rather say, the touch of nature that makes the whole world kin. For <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> that day, <b>I</b> sat down and made a simple tale from the hint she gave, and {{something}} of her own humor and pathos must have got into it, for it was accepted, and more stories solicited, to my great surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too," [...] said Hilda, enjoying a childlike {{pleasure}} {{in her own}} idea. [...] "The theme is better suited for verse than prose; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to America, I will suggest {{it to one of}} our poets. Or seven poets might write the poem together, each lighting a separate branch of the Sacred Candlestick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that is {{the oddest}} thing I ever heard. I know just such an old lady, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> I'll try your plan. It {{seems to me that}} you have a great many queer old ladies on this island," [...] I said to another man, whom they called Peter, and who stood eating pumpkin all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "I am {{travelling}} {{to recover}} my health, and every thing must {{give way to}} that. If I can only get well, I can earn money fast enough, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> to replace what we expend. The only question is, Which way will be the pleasantest and the most comfortable?" ...|$|E
60|$|Poor, dear boy! how {{innocent}} and soft-hearted {{and full of}} splendid dreams he was, and what deliciously romantic times we had floating on the pond, while the frogs sung to his accordion, {{as he tried to}} say unutterable things with his honest blue eyes. It makes me shiver now to think of the mosquitoes and the damp; but it was Pauline and Claude Melnotte then, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> we promised to be true to one another, and write every week during the year he was away at school.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "my life in England was {{different}} from yours. It was spent in monotonous work, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> at night to a shabby room in a street of small dingy houses it was too late, and I was often too dejected, to think of amusements. Twice I spent a glorious ten days among the hills, {{but that was all}} I saw of England unspoiled by tramway lines and smoke, and the holidays cost a good deal of self-denial. Railway fares were a serious obstacle." ...|$|R
6000|$|I appeased her wrath, and in {{a moment}} she transported me from the island where we were to the roof of my house, and she {{disappeared}} a moment afterwards. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> down, and opened the doors, and dug up the three thousand sequins which I had buried. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the place where my shop was, opened it, and received from my fellow-merchants congratulations on my return. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> <b>I</b> saw two black dogs who came to meet me with sorrowful faces. I was much astonished, but the fairy who reappeared said to me, ...|$|R
