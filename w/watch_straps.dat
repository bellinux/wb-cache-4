40|$|A car {{mechanic}} {{sustained a}} deep partial thickness burn {{of the wrist}} when his metal <b>watch</b> <b>strap</b> short circuited the battery of a car upon which he was working. CASE REPORT A twenty-eight year old car mechanic {{was seen in the}} skin clinic of the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre on January 30 th, 1975 with a burn of the left wrist sustained four days previously. He had been handling the engine of a vehicle which had two 12 volt batteries connected in series (i. e. a 24 volt unit) and two supporting iron rods connecting the back of the engine frame to its front. Inadvertently the patient's stainless steel <b>watch</b> <b>strap</b> touched both the positive pole of one battery and the adjacent iron rod causing a short circuit through the <b>watch</b> <b>strap</b> (Fig. 1). The patient experienced pain but was unable to pull away his hand for several seconds until the heat generated caused melting of the <b>watch</b> <b>strap</b> which broke and freed his hand. The patient immediately noticed a linear bracelet-like black burn involving the strap area of the watch but sparing the area under the watch itself. The burn seemed worse {{on the sides of the}} wrist than on the volar aspect where the metal clip was located. Fig. 1.

With increasing depth and rising water pressure the (sleeved) wrist of a diver is exposed to compression effects that have a shrinking effect on the wrist circumference.

40|$|In {{order to}} know how to use a {{tachymeter}} to help with measuring speed and distance traveled, {{it is important to know}} what a tachymeter is. Tachymeter Definition The circular dial seen on many watches is called a tachymeter. It is only installed on analog watches and has a variety of useful functions. The tiny dials and buttons on the sides of the watch operate the measuring scale. The tachymeter is a scale that measures speed. It also has the ability to measure distance travelled and at which speed it was traveled. The scale on this watch design has also been known to be used as a way to measure industrial production lines. To do this, the tachymeter can measure this at units processed per hour. The aim of its design and overall function is to use elapsed time and transfer it into speed. To illustrate, seconds for each unit into units processed each hour. This particular function can also be utilized as a stop watch for races. Watch Designs Watches with this type of scale are often made with stainless steel and come in different colors such as with a rose gold <b>watch</b> <b>strap</b> or even a stainless watch face with nato-style watch bands...|$|R

40|$|Background: Metals are {{well-known}} allergens {{that are}} most commonly encountered as alloys rather than as the pure substance. However, induction of multiple metal allergies by alloys has not been widely reported. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the prevalence of multiple metal allergies in metal-allergic patients. Methods: From August 1996 to September 2008, 97 patients (53 females and 44 males) in whom metal dermatitis was suspected were patch tested with the European standard series and a metal series. Age, sex, location of skin rash, occupation, specific metal allergies, and possible sources of sensitization were analyzed. Results: Positive patch test reactions were seen in 55 % (53 of 97) of patients, of whom 21 (40 %) were allergic to more than one metal. Nearly three-quarters were sensitized to nickel and to at least one other metal, most commonly palladium, cobalt, or gold. Jewelry, eyeglass frames, <b>watch</b> <b>straps,</b> and buttons were common sources of allergies to multiple metals. Conclusions: Metal alloys may induce multiple metal allergies. Patients suspected of having a metal allergy should be patch tested with an extended series of metals. We recommend adding palladium and gold, at least, to the standard series...|$|E
