5|$|Greatly {{concerned}} about the growing partisanship within {{the government and the}} detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together.

While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians {{as one of the greatest}} presidents in American history, usually ranking in the top three with Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Mount <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} objective, {{and is often}} climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center.

Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E

5|$|The weather of Mount <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> {{notoriously}} erratic. This {{is partly}} due to the convergence of several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due to the relative temperature differences between the Northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed from the summit of the mountain on average of 110 days per year.|$|E
