5|$|At present Eurostar is {{concentrating on}} {{developing}} its connections with other services, but direct services to other destinations <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible.</b> However, the routes that any potential services {{are likely to}} take would include infrastructure that Eurostar's rolling stock has not been built to use— German railways mostly have 15 kV AC electrification, while the Netherlands uses 1.5 kV DC (except on HSL Zuid and the Betuweroute).|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{attracted}} the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a bright enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War, having been detected in this way. The navy was interested in predicting when such detection <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible,</b> and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.|$|E

5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, {{there is a good chance}} that a sequel to Brütal Legend <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible.</b> Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear to be in her 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.|$|E
5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E

5|$|The {{airstrip}} at Kaiapit was reconnoitred on 11 September 1943 by No. 4 Squadron RAAF, which {{reported that}} it was apparently in good condition, with the Kunai grass recently cut. Lieutenant Everette E. Frazier, USAAF, selected a level, burned-off area near the Leron River, not far from Kaiapit, and landed in an L-4 Piper Cub. He determined that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to land C-47 Dakota aircraft there. On 16 September, Hutchison approved the site for Dakotas to land.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E

5|$|One further {{proposal}} {{was made to}} rebury Lody in the 1960s. In 1959 the British and German governments agreed to move German war dead who had been buried in various locations around the UK to a new central cemetery at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. The German War Graves Commission (VDK) asked if it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to disinter Lody's body and move it to Cannock Chase. By that time, the plot had been reused for further common graves, buried above Lody's body. The VDK was told {{that it would not}} be possible to disinter the other bodies without the permission of the relatives, which would have been an almost impossible task where common graves were concerned. The {{proposal was}} abandoned and Lody's body remains at Plaistow.|$|E
5|$|The first National Hurricane Center {{forecast}} on Nicole {{noted the}} development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend continued, transitioning into a tropical cyclone <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible.</b> The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60miles (95km) northwest of Bermuda. Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core within the system. Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong upper-level wind shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward {{under the influence of}} a large extratropical storm south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). Subtropical Storm Nicole lost its circulation as it was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm on October 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the Cape Verde islands issued a tropical storm warning coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on Tropical Depression Four, meaning tropical storm conditions were expected in the area within 24hours. The National Hurricane Center stated that heavy rainfall, potentially as high as 10in (250mm) in mountainous areas, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> in the territory, possibly causing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. However, due to a reformation further to the south, tropical storm warnings were discontinued as the depression moved from the area. While passing around 115mi (185km) to the southwest of the southwestern most islands, the depression produced a 35mph (55km/h) wind gust at Fogo and some rainfall, though no damage was reported.|$|E

5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E
5|$|The music, however, was {{not written}} by Fordham, {{but rather by}} several composers, {{including}} Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), Scrubs composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, the writers of hit Broadway musical Avenue Q. Marx and Lopez's involvement came {{at the suggestion of}} Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode. Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of musical genre suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{slightly}} restricted in size {{due to its}} proximity to Cardiff Rugby Club's home in the adjacent smaller stadium within Cardiff Arms Park. The WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the new stadium, and the Millennium Commission would not allow any of its funds {{to be used in}} any way {{for the construction of a}} new stadium for Cardiff RFC. The WRU held talks with Cardiff RFC to see if it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> for the club to either move or secure funding for the Cardiff Arms Park to be re-developed, but these were unsuccessful. The stadium thus had to be completed with a break in its bowl structure in the North Stand, known colloquially as the Cardiff fault or Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, then chairman of the WRU and now a former president.|$|E
