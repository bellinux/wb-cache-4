5000|$|The series {{posits that}} there have been a dozen incarnations of the <b>Warehouse</b> before the present-day 13th in South Dakota. <b>Warehouse</b> 1 was built between 336-323 BC under Alexander the Great as a place to keep {{artifacts}} obtained by war. After Alexander died, the <b>Warehouse</b> was moved to Egypt, establishing the practice of locating the <b>Warehouse</b> in the most powerful empire of the day, under the reasoning that it will be best defended there. Egypt's Ptolemaic rulers appointed a group of people, known as the Regents, to oversee the <b>Warehouse</b> and act as its first [...] "agents" [...] and collectors of artifacts. <b>Warehouse</b> 2 lasted until the Roman conquest of Egypt. Other warehouses: <b>Warehouse</b> 3 in Western Roman Empire (Italy), <b>Warehouse</b> 4 in Hunnic Empire until the death of Attila the Hun, <b>Warehouse</b> 5 in Byzantine Empire, <b>Warehouse</b> 6 in Cambodia under Khmer Empire, <b>Warehouse</b> 7 in the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan, <b>Warehouse</b> 8 in Germany during the Holy Roman Empire (1260-1517), <b>Warehouse</b> 9 in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople until the death of Suleiman the Magnificent, <b>Warehouse</b> 10 in Mughal Empire (India), <b>Warehouse</b> 11 in the Russian Empire under the Romanov Dynasty (the 1812 Napoleonic War with Russia was an attempt to seize control of <b>Warehouse</b> 11), and <b>Warehouse</b> 12 in the United Kingdom from 1830 until 1914. It was during the time of <b>Warehouse</b> 11 that the Regents began to employ agents to gather and protect artifacts.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the economic viability of the electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipt registry introduction, as a step toward electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts. Both forms of <b>warehouse</b> receipt paper and electronic exist in practice, but paper <b>warehouse</b> receipts are more widespread. In this paper, the dematerialization process is analyzed in two steps. The first step is the dematerialization of <b>warehouse</b> receipt registry, with <b>warehouse</b> receipts still in paper form. The second step is the introduction of electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts themselves. Dematerialization of <b>warehouse</b> receipts is more complex than that for financial securities, because of the individual characteristics of each <b>warehouse</b> receipt. As a consequence, electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts are in place for only to a handful of commodities, namely cotton and a few grains. Nevertheless, the movement towards the electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipt, which began several decades ago with financial securities, is now taking hold in the agricultural sector. In this paper is analyzed Serbian electronic registry, since the Serbia is first country in EU with electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts registry donated by FAO. Performed analysis shows the considerable impact of electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts registry establishment on enhancing the security of the system of public <b>warehouses,</b> and on advancing the trade with <b>warehouse</b> receipt...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} management processes that plan, control, and optimize <b>warehouse</b> operations. The inventory in <b>warehouses</b> decouples supply from demand. As such, {{economies of scale}} can be achieved in production, purchasing, and transport. As <b>warehouses</b> {{become more and more}} vital for the success of many companies, they are facing increasing demands with respect to costs, productivity, and customer service. At the same time, <b>warehouse</b> operations have become more complex due to developments such as value added services, e-fulfillment, and up-scaling <b>warehouses.</b> Consequently, planning, controlling, and optimizing <b>warehouse</b> operations, defined as <b>warehouse</b> management in this dissertation, have become a distinguishing factor for supply chain performance. This dissertation explores <b>warehouse</b> management by studying the effects of the characteristics of a <b>warehouse</b> (i. e., context) on the structure (i. e., design) of <b>warehouse</b> management. In addition, the match (i. e., fit) between characteristics and structure is researched as an important driver of <b>warehouse</b> performance. By conducting empirical research using a multiple case study and a survey study, an overall theoretical model on structuring high performance <b>warehouse</b> management has been developed...|$|R

5|$|Norfolk's {{city leaders}} began a long push to revive its urban core. While Granby Street {{underwent}} decline, Norfolk city leaders {{focused on the}} waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and <b>warehousing</b> facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's skyline have been erected. In 1983, the city and The Rouse Company developed the Waterside festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment. Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the Harbor Park baseball stadium, home of the Norfolk Tides Triple-A minor league baseball team. In 1995, the park was named the finest facility in minor league baseball by Baseball America. Norfolk's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim from economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country. Downtown's rising fortunes helped to expand the city's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods.|$|E
