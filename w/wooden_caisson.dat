2500|$|The [...] "other means" [...] {{was some}} kind of {{inclined}} plane in which canal boats could be lowered and raised to accommodate the vertical interval between the two sections of the canal. At that time, systems of this kind had already been installed in the Shropshire Canal in 1788 and 1790, where 5 tonne boats were hauled up inclines dry, on cradles. In 1798 there had been an attempt on the Somerset Coal Canal to use a system in which 20 tonne boats could rise and descend vertically in a float chamber, the boat contained within a timber caisson; this had been unsuccessful. In 1809 a vertical lift had been installed at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, where boats in a <b>wooden</b> <b>caisson</b> were winched up by manpower; it was not successful and was replaced in 1815.|$|E
50|$|The nave has a rich <b>wooden</b> <b>caisson</b> ceiling. Paintings {{include a}} Tinity by Gianserio Strafella, St. Anthony of Padua by Oronzo Tiso and The Adoration of the Shepherd by Giovanni Battista Lama.|$|E
50|$|The bridge's engineer, Apollodorus of Damascus, used wooden arches, each {{spanning}} 38 m, set on twenty masonry pillars made of bricks, mortar, and pozzolana cement. It {{was built}} unusually quickly (between 103 and 105), employing {{the construction of}} a <b>wooden</b> <b>caisson</b> for each pier.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began and}} was {{completed}} during 1894; a <b>wooden</b> <b>caisson</b> was used, {{topped by a}} cylinder of cast iron plates. The house itself was built of brick, painted red in the late 1920s, standing two stories with the lantern on its roof. Unlike the Maryland examples, the roof is flat. Quantities of rip-rap were dumped {{around the base of}} the light to resist pressure from the ice.|$|E
5000|$|Fourteen Foot Bank Light is a {{lighthouse}} in the Delaware Bay near Bowers Beach, Delaware. Built in 1885-1886 {{at the south}} end of Joe Flogger Shoal, it was the first lighthouse to be built using a pneumatic caisson. The <b>wooden</b> <b>caisson</b> structure was excavated to a depth of 23 ft below the seabed, then filled with [...] of concrete. A cast-iron base was meanwhile erected on the caisson as it sank. A house-like structure was built on top of the base, designed by H.A. Ramsay and Son of Baltimore. Engineers for the structure were Anderson and Barr, and the contractor was D.P. Heap.|$|E
50|$|The Tardebigge {{vertical}} lift {{was invented by}} John Woodhouse and installed at his own expense, with excavation and masonry provided by the company. Finished on 24 June 1808, it was housed in a covered shed and used a fixed counterweight of bricks, connected {{by a set of}} eight parallel chains and pulleys. Lifting was performed by two men using a windlass. The 64-ton <b>wooden</b> <b>caisson</b> (lifting chamber) was sealed at each end by guillotine gates, as was the lock chamber. It succeeded in lifting 110 boats in 12 hours but was considered too fragile for permanent use. The remainder of the canal was built with locks, and the lift was replaced by one in 1815. The lift mechanism has gone but the outline of its balancing pit may be seen near the lock keeper's cottage.|$|E
