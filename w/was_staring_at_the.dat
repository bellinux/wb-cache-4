2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that he <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> space between the upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said {{that there is only}} a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E

60|$|The silvery figure {{among the}} green leaves seems to linger as if hypnotised, though his escape is easy behind him; he <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man below.|$|R
60|$|He paused. Father Pedro <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} with an uncompromising rigidity of {{head and}} shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately {{she seemed}} to expect no answer to this query. She <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall with unseeing eyes.|$|E
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strange message which I had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a {{sheet of}} {{foolscap}} on my knee.|$|E
6000|$|A proud man was the Roman, [...] His speech {{a single}} one, [...] But {{his eyes were}} like an eagle's eyes [...] That <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|R
60|$|He assented readily, {{indeed it}} was clear that he wished to be rid of them, for <b>the</b> other men <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> guide and their companion, and muttering amongst themselves.|$|R
60|$|But as {{the great}} moment drew near {{there were no more}} questions; two {{children}} <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock and listening intently for the peal of a bell nearly five hundred miles away.|$|R
60|$|He stopped abruptly, and colored. For Stephen <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> jagged scar, He {{had never}} summoned {{the courage to}} ask Richter how he came by it.|$|E
6000|$|Brain <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dull blue {{gleam of}} the ax head with fierce and fascinated eyes. [...] "I don't {{understand}} you," [...] he said. [...] "There is no--there are no marks on it." ...|$|E
60|$|Out on {{the drive}} Billie <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man in armour who had now, with a masterful wrench which {{informed}} the car right away that he would stand no nonsense, set the engine going again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> French {{diamonds}} in that corner store. I never {{can get you}} by there without a regular tug," [...] cried Laura, when the tale was very briefly told.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Merrick and Patsy <b>were</b> both <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man incredulously.|$|R
60|$|The youth on whom Shoveloff {{tried to}} turn the laugh of his own discomfiture was a splendid fellow, tall and broad-shouldered enough {{for a man of}} twenty-five, though his smooth and {{youthful}} face suggested sixteen. He had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire, regardless {{of what was going on}} around.|$|R
6000|$|... "The manager {{appeared}} {{silently in}} the doorway; I stepped out {{at once and}} he drew the curtain after me. The Russian, eyed curiously by the pilgrims, <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shore. I followed {{the direction of his}} glance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want a {{whole lot}} of things," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "Do you want to do your talking here or in the house?" [...] And he glanced at the cab driver, who <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boys with his mouth open in curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a {{doubt of}} it," [...] said Sir John, who <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> broken picture with {{chattering}} teeth, {{and his eyes}} almost starting out of his head; [...] "but if I were you, I should get him to drive me a little straighter, that's all." ...|$|E

A large group of chickens are eating the feeding along the ground...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture, cogitating what {{insulting}} message I {{could write}} on it, when I heard the woman's voice again. [...] "I {{think she has}} known him since she were a babby," [...] she was saying, [...] "for this here was a present he give her." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} struck at Lincoln's face, and incontinently a negro had him by collar and arm. He {{wrenched}} himself away, his sleeve tore noisily, and he stumbled back, to be tripped {{by the other}} attendant. Then he struck the ground heavily and he <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> distant ceiling of the hall.|$|E
60|$|I bowed, {{and handed}} {{them over to the}} waiter whose duty it was to serve at their table. As I passed down the room, I glanced towards the Hirsch table. They had ceased their conversation. Every one of them <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newcomers. Soon they began to whisper together. Madame beckoned to me.|$|E
5000|$|Flash Bangs {{are more}} often seen on airsoft days. The flash bang has the same {{lighting}} technique as the hand grenade and smoke bomb, but after the fuse has been lit, it sparks a bright white flash to temporarily blind the opposition, or any other players that <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pyrotechnic when it went off.|$|R
60|$|But he <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> moodily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{elevator}} boy and did {{not seem}} to hear.|$|R
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> asylum, Marian and Hartright {{are told}} that Anne is docile but is still given drugs for delusions. They go to her room where a woman dressed in white <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall. As Marian {{approaches}} her, she realizes {{that it is not}} Anne, but her sister Laura! They take Laura away from there, but Laura is at first catatonic.|$|R
60|$|Bertha's {{eyes were}} shining like stars. She tried to smile, but {{burst into tears}} instead and her head went down on her brother's shoulder. By this time {{everybody}} in the room <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> extraordinary tableau, and Ernest, coming through the hall, gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back {{to a sense of}} their surroundings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in {{love with}} your sister; but in love, Charlotte--in love!" [...] the young man pursued.

[...] "In short, I 'm in love, dear lady," [...] said Felix. [...] "Now I want you to help me." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the nave}} {{it was cool}} and dim; he <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blaze of candles on the great altar, and thinking, I am sure, of his {{incomparable}} Countess. I sat down beside him, and after a while, as if to avoid the appearance of eagerness, he asked me how I had enjoyed my visit to Casa Salvi, and what I thought of the padrona.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this time}} Syme had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Doctor almost as {{steadily}} as <b>the</b> Doctor stared <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Professor, but quite without the smile. The nerves of both comrades-in-arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability, when Syme suddenly leant forward and idly tapped {{the edge of}} the table. His message to his ally ran, [...] "I have an intuition." ...|$|R
60|$|Corky <b>was</b> {{standing}} <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture. His {{face was}} set. There was a hunted {{look in his}} eye.|$|R
