5|$|Cedar Fair {{purchased}} the park from Six Flags in 2004 for $145 million. They announced intentions of returning {{the park to}} its roots as a family-oriented amusement park. The efforts to downsize the park eventually led to X-Flight's removal. On November 22, 2006, Geauga Lake park officials announced that X-Flight was being dismantled {{to be sent to}} another unspecified Cedar Fair property. Moving the ride <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time, as the final sections of track and supports wouldn't be removed until March 2007.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2008, the RCMP {{ruled out}} laying {{criminal}} charges {{in relation to}} the accident. It stated that the finding had been reviewed by a Crown prosecutor and that no wrongdoing was found. The families of two of the deceased expressed disapproval of the decision and indicated that they may bring a lawsuit against several of the involved parties, though others have publicly stated that they accepted the decision. The chief coroner of the province stated that a provincial inquest was possible, though it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time to come to any decision on the matter. No decision on whether or not to have an inquest was made for over a month.|$|E
5|$|By May 1940, Castle Bromwich {{had not yet}} {{built its}} first Spitfire, in spite of {{promises}} that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April. On 17 May, Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing {{over control of the}} Castle Bromwich plant to his Ministry. Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced management staff and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave over control of the factory to Vickers-Armstrong. Although it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time to resolve the problems, in June 1940, 10 Mk IIs were built; 23 rolled out in July, 37 in August, and 56 in September. By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945, a total of 12,129 Spitfires (921 Mk IIs, 4,489 Mk Vs, 5,665 Mk IXs, and 1,054 Mk XVIs) had been built. CBAF {{went on to become the}} largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939–45 conflict. As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK, by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month, it built over half of the approximately 20,000 aircraft of this type.|$|E

5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of the satiric edge off.|$|E
25|$|Although parasites are {{generally}} considered to be harmful, the eradication of all parasites would not necessarily be beneficial. Parasites account for at least half of life's diversity; they perform an important ecological role (by weakening prey) that ecosystems <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time to adapt to; and without parasites, organisms may eventually tend to asexual reproduction, diminishing the diversity of sexually dimorphic traits.|$|E
25|$|The sweeter cola {{overwhelmingly}} beat both regular Coke and Pepsi in taste tests, surveys, {{and focus}} groups. Asked {{if they would}} buy and drink the product if it were Coca-Cola, most testers said they would, although it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> getting used to. About 10-12% of testers felt angry and alienated at the thought, and said they might stop drinking Coke altogether. Their presence in focus groups tended to negatively skew results as they exerted indirect peer pressure on other participants.|$|E

25|$|However, HAFRABA {{was never}} able to surmount the {{logistical}} problems of building a highway through many different jurisdictions, or the funding problems of such a large undertaking. Moreover, legislators condemned it as a luxury project that would benefit only the few wealthy enough to own cars; the Nazi Party was against public spending on highways for this reason, as were the Communists and the Reichsbahn, the German national railroad, which feared highways <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of its freight business. Even the association of German car manufacturers did not support highway projects; they were concerned that long-distance driving would overtax their vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Personnel from RAF Andreas {{recovered}} the bodies to that base for identification.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the violence of the previous tour had an effect on the band's direction. The band had also become increasingly interested in music other than punk rock, such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and some of the members (particularly Ginn) used cannabis. (However, various members had been fans of such music long before Black Flag, with Ginn being an avid Grateful Dead fan, and Cadena a fan of Hawkwind.) Newer material (which can be heard on the 1982 Demos bootleg) was slower and less like typical punk music, with classic rock and blues influences seeping in. Cadena left to form his own band DC3. He <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of the new songs he had written for Black Flag with him and record them for DC3's debut album.|$|E
25|$|Understanding that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time {{to develop}} new Aston Martin products, they created an {{engineering}} service subsidiary to develop automotive products for other companies. It was decided to use, a trade name of Salmons & Son their in-house coachbuilder, Tickford which Aston Martin had bought in 1955. Tickford's name had been long associated with expensive high quality carriages and cars and their folding roofs. New products included a Tickford Austin Metro, a Tickford Ford Capri and even Tickford train interiors, particularly on the Jaguar XJS. Pace continued sponsoring racing events, and now sponsored all Aston Martin Owners Club events, taking a Tickford-engined Nimrod Group C car owned by AMOC President Viscount Downe, which came third in the Manufacturers Championship in both 1982 and 1983. It also finished seventh in the 1982 24 Hours of Le Mans race. However, sales of production cars were now {{at an all-time low}} of 30 cars produced in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Researchers today doubt Las Casas' {{figures for}} the pre-contact levels of the Taíno population, {{considering}} them an exaggeration. For example, Anderson Córdova estimates a maximum of 500,000 people inhabiting the island. The Taíno population estimates vary a great deal, from {{a few hundred thousand}} up to 8,000,000. They had no resistance to Old World diseases, notably smallpox. The encomienda system brought many Taíno to work in the fields and mines in exchange for Spanish protection, education, and a seasonal salary. Under the pretense of searching for gold and other materials, many Spaniards took advantage of the regions now under control of the anaborios and Spanish encomenderos to exploit the native population by seizing their land and wealth. It <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time before the Taíno revolted against their oppressors — both Indian and Spanish alike — and many military campaigns before Emperor Charles V eradicated the encomienda system as a form of slavery.|$|E

500|$|In 1919, {{the matter}} went to {{consideration}} in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their need on the Teschen coal, useful {{in order to}} influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles were to get {{most of the people}} and the strategic rail line. Watt writes: [...] "Czech envoy Edvard Beneš proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Beneš was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Beneš knew what he was doing.

500|$|From the {{beginning}} of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleeps development, the staff decided its story would have three plot lines centered around three different characters, with Aqua's being the last one written. The original ending of Aqua's storyline showed her trapped {{in the realm of}} darkness, but that part was moved to the game's [...] "Last Episode" [...] playthrough {{in order to keep the}} game from being too negative in tone. In terms of gameplay, Aqua was designed to be a character gamers <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> getting used to, and recommended them use her as the last one in order to understand the game's story better, pointing out the intention that Aqua would be the last character to leave the Land of Departure in her scenario. The staff developed her movements to reflect her personality as a serious and dignified young woman. In the making of Kingdom Hearts 2.8, co-director Tai Yasue expressed the staff wanted to explore Aqua's torment in this title as she became trapped in the realm of darkness to the point they showed how the character wanted to escape from it as she became isolated.|$|E
500|$|As media {{scrutiny}} on Patton increased, his bluntness stirred controversy. These {{began in}} North Africa when some reporters {{worried that he}} was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies. His public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke. Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at Knutsford England and said, in part, [...] "since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better we know each other, the better job we will do." [...] The next day news accounts misquoted Patton by leaving off the Russians. On a visit home after the war he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them [...] "the real heroes" [...] of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers {{who had been killed}} in action. His final media blowup occurred in September 1945, when goaded by reporters about denazification, he said [...] "enazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi Democrats or Republicans and that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time." [...] This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army.|$|E
