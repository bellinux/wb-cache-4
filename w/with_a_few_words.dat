Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote {{that while the}} series had two goals to perform {{by the end of}} the episode—to turn Nellie into a relatable character and break Andy and Jessica up—he felt that both plots failed in execution. He wrote that because the audience knew nothing about Jessica and that he had [...] "already given up on" [...] Nellie as a character, the episode ultimately became an unfunny' experience". He ultimately gave the episode a C. Cindy White of IGN compared the writer's attempt to humanize Nellie to the previous seasons, specifically [...] "The Dundies" [...] when the writers humanized Michael and wrote that she hoped the writers would continue to do this with Nellie. She also went on to praise the interaction between Jim and Pam, saying [...] "Their ability ... to communicate volumes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> or merely a glance demonstrates why their chemistry has been so difficult to replicate with other couples." [...] Despite her mainly positive review, she criticized the Andy and Erin subplot because she neither cared about Jessica or Andy and Erin's relationship and called the whole subplot [...] "a waste of time". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10, calling it [...] "Good". Writing for New York, Lucy Teitler unfavorably compared the Andy-Erin plotline to Jim and Pam's from the early seasons of the series, writing that the romance was not able to [...] "take off, because Erin has no real agency" [...] and that the scene where Andy returned to the bachelorette party felt too superficial to reach its potential of becoming a [...] "classic" [...] Office scene.|$|E
