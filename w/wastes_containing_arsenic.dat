40|$|Arsenic is {{ubiquitous}} {{whether it}} is naturally occurring or produced by humans. It is found at sites on the National Priority List and at sites operated by DOE, where {{it is the second}} most commonly found contaminant. More <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>arsenic</b> will be produced due to the lowering of the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for arsenic in drinking water which will result in more treatment facilities for arsenic removal that will generate residuals. Furthermore, arsenic can be released from such wastes under the reduced conditions that are found in landfills. Pyrite (FeS 2) is believed to be a compound that has a high affinity for arsenic and is stable under anoxic conditions. The first task of this research was to develop a method for making pyrite crystals of defined size with minimal reaction time and at high yield. Effects on the synthesis of pyrite particles of pH, the ratio of Fe/S, temperature and reaction time were investigated in batch reactor systems. Pyrite was synthesized within 24 hours at pH values ranging from pH 3. 6 through pH 5. 6, and at a ratio of Fe/S of 0. 5. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to size and characterize the pyrite particles. Experimental and analytical procedures developed for this work, included a hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry method for measuring arsenic species (As(III), As(V)). The synthesized pyrite was applied to remove arsenic and its maximum capacity for arsenic removal was measured in batch adsorption experiments to be 3. 23 ?mol/g for As(III) and 113 ?mol/g for As(V). Information obtained on the characteristics of chemical species before and after the reaction with arsenic showed that iron and sulfur were oxidized. Last, how strongly arsenic was bound to pyrite was investigated and it was determined that release of arsenic from As(III) -pyrite is not affected by pH, but release from As(V) -pyrite is affected by pH with minimum release in the range pH 5 to pH 8...|$|E
40|$|Different {{analytical}} methods {{were applied to}} analyse the leachates obtained from leach tests on S/S industrial <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>arsenic</b> and the treated percolate water from a landfill. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) {{was used to determine}} total As and other elements, hydride generation-ICP-MS for the determination of As(III) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) for As(III) and As(V). Interferences and matrix effects were studied in detail and corrected for. For the leachates, no corrections were required, for treated percolate water with lower As concentrations, in the case of ICP-MS important corrections were necessary. Results for different types of leach tests (extraction, static and semi-dynamic) and for treated percolate waters are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. The {{calcium arsenate}} <b>waste,</b> <b>containing</b> amounts of <b>arsenic</b> (7. 62 wt%), was treated using solidification/stabilization {{technology}} (S/S) with geopolymer. In order {{to optimize the}} procedure for S/S, 9 different S/S samples, differing in amount of the geopolymer materials were prepared. On these samples, extraction tests were performed, showing that the arsenic concentration in the leachate was less than the China countermeasure standard (5 mg/l) after 28 days of curing when a geopolymer (GP) dosages more than 30 wt%. Furthermore, the samples showed substantially decreasing leachability with curing times. But there was no appreciable change in leachability under various time and pH conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work {{was dedicated to}} the problem arising from the coexistence of arsenic and organic substances principally in the US (the Superfund Sites) and Bangladesh. Dissolved organic ions are strong competitors to arsenates, and because of their large size and slow kinetics, arsenic removal becomes problematic. Macroporous ion exchange media can remove both arsenic and organic pollutants efficiently while preserving exchange capacity and effluent quality. The novelty of this work {{is characterized by the}} determination of interdependence of important factors influencing the sorption of arsenates and organic substances by macroporous ion exchange media. Exchange capacities of these resins in both chloride and hydroxyl forms in acidic media as well as the chloride-form operating in weakly basic medium were investigated. The investigations were focused on factors such as the effects of pH, influent concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and filtration velocity. Interaction of these effects was also investigated. Reducing the pH from 10. 4 to 7. 0 increased the arsenate-exchange capacity from 28 meq/kg to 63 meq/kg (a 35 meq/kg increase). Optimum conditions for regeneration of macroporous media have been determined such as a NaCl consumption of 300 kg/tonne, a concentration of NaCl solution of 10 %, a ratio of NaCl concentration to that of NaOH in regenerant of 10, a regeneration rate of 4 m/h, and a temperature of 40 { 493 } C. Waste handling processes have been developed to treat and reuse spent regeneration solutions as well as to detoxify the solid <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>arsenic</b> and organic matter. A reagent based technology for the treatment of spent regeneration solutions by Ca(OH) 2 and MgCl 2 (or MgSO 4) has been devised. Based on the results, appropriate decontamination schemes have been developed for groundwater contaminated with arsenic and organic impurities. The benefit of these schemes is guidance for the organization of the treatment process depending upon the levels of mineralization and concentration of DOM as well as the conditions for the implementation of the process (for an existing or new treatment unit to be designed...|$|R
40|$|Dimethylarsinic Acid (DMA) or (CH 3) 2 AsO 2 H is an {{important}} organoarsenical compound detected in arsenic speciation studies of environmental samples and synthesized during pyrolysis of oil shale. DMA was used historically as a herbicide on large agricultural fields and can be detected in the leachates of landfills rich in <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>arsenic</b> such as glass, alloys, and semiconductors, as well as biologically pre-treated municipal solid waste. Under certain soil conditions DMA can become bio-available and {{has the potential to}} be recycled to more toxic inorganic forms of arsenic. Bioavailability of DMA is largely controlled by the extent of its interactions with reactive components in soil. Little is known about these interactions, particularly with iron oxides that have high affinity to arsenic compounds and are ubiquitous components of soil. In this thesis, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to obtain energies, optimal geometries and vibrational frequencies for hydrated DMA-iron oxide clusters. Calculations were performed using Gaussian 09, running on Sharcnet, with the B 3 LYP and BMK functionals and the 6 - 31 G(d) and 6 - 311 +G(d,p) basis sets. Solvation is simulated by adding explicit water molecules, as well as using the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM) and the universal solvation model (SMD). Various ligand exchange reactions are constructed to investigate the thermodynamics of inner- and outer-sphere complex formation. The Gibbs free energies of adsorption (Gads) for these reactions are calculated and results indicate that both inner- and outer-sphere complex formation is thermodynamically favourable with bidentate complexes being most favourable. Similarly, the Gibbs free energies of desorption (Gdes) are calculated for various desorption reactions of DMA due to interactions with phosphate ions and it is determined that desorption favourability of DMA increases in the order of bidentate 3 ̆c monodentate 3 ̆c outer-sphere. These theoretical studies are used to explain experimental infrared spectral peaks and provide geometrical parameters useful for modeling x-ray absorption data using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) showing DMA-Fe inter-atomic distances to be within 3. 3 - 3. 4 Å for the bidentate complexes, within 3. 4 - 4. 9 Å for monodentate complexes and 4. 8 - 6. 8 Å for outer-sphere complexes...|$|R

40|$|Brine {{disposal}} is {{a serious}} challenge of arsenic (V) removal from drinking water using ion-exchange (IX). Although arsenic removal with ferric chloride (FeCl 3) from drinking waters is well documented, the application of FeCl 3 to remove arsenic (V) from brines has not been thoroughly investigated. In contrast to drinking water, IX brines contain high ionic strength, high alkalinity, and high arsenic concentrations; these factors are known to influence arsenic removal by FeCl 3. Surface complexation modeling and experimental coagulation tests were performed to investigate the influence of ionic strength, pH, Fe/As molar ratios, and alkalinity on the removal of arsenic from IX brines. The model prediction was in good agreement with the experimental data. Optimum pH range {{was found to be}} between 4. 5 and 6. 5. The arsenic removal efficiency slightly improved with higher ionic strength. The Fe/As ratios needed to treat brines were significantly lower than those used to treat drinking waters. For arsenic (V) concentrations typical in IX brines, Fe/As molar ratios varying from 1. 3 to 1. 7 were needed. Sludge solid concentrations varying from 2 to 18 mg L− 1 were found. The results of this research have direct application to the treatment of residual <b>wastes</b> brines <b>containing</b> <b>arsenic...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most {{land in the}} Trout Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21stcentury, and <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> mercury and <b>arsenic</b> was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|R
