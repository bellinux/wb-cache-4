Jay Cox after the success of his previous screenplay, Sweet Home Alabama, gave him the financial resources and critical credit to write a more personal love story. Cox based both characters– Christian and Aaron– on himself. He was raised as a Mormon and served a mission before coming out as gay, and had wondered <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> halves of himself would have said to each other if they had ever met.|$|E
500|$|Aimée and Manon cannot {{remain on}} the farm, and Papet offers to buy them out. As mother and {{daughter}} are packing their belongings, Papet and Ugolin {{make their way to}} where they blocked the spring, to pull out the plug. Manon follows them, and when she sees <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> are doing, [...] understands and gives out a shriek. The men hear it, but quickly dismiss the sound as that of a buzzard making a kill. As Papet performs a mock baptism of his nephew in the cold water of the spring, the film ends with the caption [...] "end of part one".|$|E

500|$|In January 1987, Stella Nickell's adult daughter, Cynthia Hamilton, {{approached}} {{police with}} information: Nickell {{had spoken to}} her daughter repeatedly about wanting her husband dead. He was a bore, Nickell said, who after having gotten sober, preferred {{to stay home and}} watch television rather than go out to bars. Nickell, Hamilton claimed, had even told her that she had tried to poison Bruce previously with foxglove. When that failed, she had begun library research into other methods and hit upon cyanide. [...] Cynthia also claimed that Nickell had spoken to her about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> of them could do with the insurance money if Bruce Nickell were dead.|$|E
500|$|After a {{short time}} living with Ehnni's family, the couple {{relocated}} to Algiers. Eberhardt became disappointed with Ehnni, whose only ambition after leaving the army appeared to be finding an unskilled job {{that would allow him}} to live relatively comfortably. She increased her own efforts as a writer, and several of her short stories were printed in the local press. She accepted a job offer from Al-Akhbar (...) newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand in March 1902. Ebrhardt became a regular contributor to the newspaper; Trimardeur began appearing as a serial in August 1903. Barrucand and Eberhardt formed a friendship, though Barrucand was frequently frustrated with his new employee's work ethic. Eberhardt's articles arrived irregularly, as she would only write when she felt like doing so. Her job paid poorly, but had many benefits. Through Barrucand's contacts, Eberhardt was able to access the famous zawiya of Lalla Zaynab. Eberhardt spoke highly of her time with Zaynab, though never disclosed <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> discussed; their meeting, however, caused concern among the French authorities.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the period}} from 1893 to 1914, the Stanley Cup was a [...] "challenge trophy"; the {{champion}}s held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently defeated the reigning Cup champion in a special game or series. The playoff format for each challenge varied depending on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> competing clubs agreed to.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a {{separate}} dissent {{in the same}} lines as Scalia's.

He reasoned that the jury clearly understood <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> possibilities were, and thus no due process violation had occurred.|$|E
2500|$|In summary, {{although}} both Confucianism and Legalism {{were developed in}} a period of turmoil and both were aimed at the re-unification of the country, the two theories went opposite directions with one advocating for and one against the use of formal laws to achieve social order. [...] <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> theories have in common is their concession of the ultimate authority to the ruler, who remained above and beyond the li or law. [...] It is true that neither theory is ideal in achieving a social order. [...] Nevertheless, both theories have {{had a significant impact on}} the cultural and legal development in China, and their influence remains visible today.|$|E
2500|$|Unsurprisingly, the {{recorded}} RTs {{for the primary}} response trials, failed stop trials, and [...] "failed-to-decide" [...] trials all showed similar RTs: 600ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some [...] "successful decide" [...] trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as [...] "successful decide". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were {{the results of a}} conscious [...] "I will not veto", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal.

2500|$|After he {{had already}} {{explored}} all {{that had previously been}} discovered, Bishop began to grow bored with the cave. He knew there was more out there, but there was a limit to how far the more experienced guides would go. The farthest anyone had been in the cave was to the bottomless pit: a massive hole of darkness. None would dare venture near the pit for fear of being lost forever in its depths. Bishop was brave and his curiosity was greater than his fear. Along with a guest who was equally as curious and daring as Bishop, the two men journeyed to the pit. With the help of an old ladder found nearby, they laid it across the gaping mouth of the pit and slowly ventured across the ladder. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men discovered opened up a whole new part of the cave. A short way further from the pit Bishop discovered a river. This was the first body of water that had ever been encountered in the cave. [...] As he explored the river he found eyeless fish: something that no one had ever heard about at this time. This brought scientists to the cave to study the new creature. Some of the most popular areas of the cave were both discovered and named by Bishop after crossing the bottomless pit.|$|E
2500|$|The god {{indicated}} that they were getting closer when they arrived at a place called Nexticpan, which is where the San Antonio Abad Hospital is now, and later to a place called Mixiuhcan, now the colonia of Magdalena Mixiuhcan. They wandered another 36years knowing that they were extremely close. Then they sent two priests named Axolóhua and Cuauhcoatl to look for the sign promised by their god. The two found an islet near the western shore of Lake Texcoco surrounded by green water. In the middle of the islet was a nopal and perched upon it was an eagle with its wings spread and its face looking toward the sun. When the eagle left, Axolóhua submerged himself into the waters around the island and Cuaucoatl went back to report what he saw. The people were confused because <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> priests had seen was only part of the sign they were told to expect. Twenty-four hours later Axolóhua returned stating that while underwater, he saw the god Tlaloc who told him that they did indeed find the place and that they were welcome. They moved to the islet and began to construct their city. Later versions of the story have a snake in the eagle's mouth. The Mexica called their city Tenochtitlan meaning [...] "place of the nopal," [...] referring to the myth of its discovery. Gongora gives the day 18July1327, but at least three other codices (Azcatitlan, Mexicanus and Mendoza) placed the time of its founding in the year 1325, and los Anales de Tlatelolco adds the day-sign [...] "1 Zipaktli," [...] correlated to the beginning of summer solstice on 20 June.|$|E
