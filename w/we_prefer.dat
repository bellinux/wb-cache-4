If we seek the blending of science and religion and the integration of secular knowledge with sacred wisdom, then {{it is not in}} the subject matter of these fields but rather within the personality of the individual that we hope to achieve the synthesis.|$|E

In this categorical system, many people whose features place them {{close to a}} subtype boundary change pattern without {{a major change in}} pathophysiology. Moreover, the heterogeneity and variable natural history of IBS significantly limit clinical trials of motility-active drugs and drug therapy in practice.|$|E

Acoustics for the version is provided by Sanjoy Das (Bapi) and Keba Jeremiah. Rajiv Vijayakar reviewing for Bollywood Hungama stated, [...] "Of the two versions of 'Meherbaan' <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> the solo Shekhar Rajviani reprise over the Ash King-Shilpa Rao-Shekhar Ravjiani one, though <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> the reprise version by alone".|$|R

25|$|The {{reaction}} to the encyclical's continued prohibitions of artificial birth control was very mixed. In Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland, the encyclical was welcomed. In Latin America, much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical. As World Bank President Robert McNamara declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources, doctors in La Paz, Bolivia called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation. In Colombia, Cardinal archbishop Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared, if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> not to receive one cent. The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences, but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies. The Jesuit Journal Sic dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions.|$|E

[...] The assassination campaign was reportedly terminated in 2013 following diplomatic pressure from the United States, which was attempting to negotiate restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities.|$|E

500|$|The premiere, {{originally}} planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th {{because of the}} illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as [...] "a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes..." [...] The audience's appreciation was not reflected {{in the majority of}} the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that [...] "this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a [...] "claque" [...] of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{critics of}} Keats enjoyed the poem, {{and it was}} heavily quoted in their reviews. An {{anonymous}} review of Keats's poetry that ran in the August and October 1820 Scots Magazine stated: [...] "Amongst the minor poems <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> the 'Ode to the Nightingale.' Indeed, we are inclined to prefer it beyond every other poem in the book; but let the reader judge. The third and seventh stanzas have a charm for us which we should {{find it difficult to}} explain. We have read this ode over and over again, and every time with increased delight." [...] At the same time, Leigh Hunt wrote a review of Keats's poem for the 2 August and 9 August 1820 The Indicator: [...] "As a specimen of the Poems, which are all lyrical, we must indulge ourselves in quoting entire the 'Ode to a Nightingale'. There is that mixture in it of real melancholy and imaginative relief, which poetry alone presents us in her 'charmed cup,' and which some over-rational critics have undertaken to find wrong because it is not true. It does not follow that what is not true to them, is not true to others. If the relief is real, the mixture is good and sufficing." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E

30|$|For animal studies, {{there are}} no well-accepted {{extrapolation}} methods. Since scaling most likely would decrease {{the values of the}} TIACs and, consequently, the absorbed doses, <b>we</b> <b>preferred,</b> for this study, to provide a conservative dose assessment without performing inter-species scaling.|$|R

2500|$|Karl Popper {{argues that}} a {{preference}} for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its falsifiability criterion: <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> simpler theories to more complex ones [...] "because their empirical content is greater; {{and because they are}} better testable" [...] (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.|$|E

And granted, the 454s will squirt through traffic with just a feather touch on the gas pedal. But, to us at least, the small block engine contributes to a fine sense of balance in the Corvette that is rare in any GT car, so rare {{that it would be a}} shame to exchange it for a few lb.-ft. of torque.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Martin's {{argument}} {{that the history of}} the rule favored the elements test also met with Blackmun's agreement. In addition to the examples of use prior to its adoption that Martin had mentioned, Blackmun found that the Court itself had used it back in 1896. Lastly he agreed that it could not produce certain, uniform results, pointing to the case before the Court as an example. [...] "The three judges of the original appellate panel split in their application of the inherent relationship test to the offenses of mail fraud and odometer tampering," [...] Blackmun wrote. [...] "In the context of rules of criminal procedure, where certainty and predictability are desired, <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> the clearer standard for applying Rule 31(c)." ...|$|E

During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013, Google explained that [...] "Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert", although a Google spokesperson told CNN {{in an interview that}} [...] "It’s kind of like an internal team thing, and <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> {{to be a little bit}} — how should I say — a bit inscrutable in the matter, I’ll say".|$|E
2500|$|Some British writers, however, {{applauded the}} inquiry. G. K. Chesterton contrasted the American {{objective}} of maximum openness {{with what he}} called Britain's [...] "national evil", which he described as being to [...] "hush everything up; it is to damp everything down; it is to leave the great affair unfinished, to leave every enormous question unanswered." [...] He argued that [...] "it does not much matter whether Senator Smith knows the facts; what matters is whether he is really trying to find them out." [...] The Review of Reviews, whose founder William Stead was among {{the victims of the}} disaster, declared: [...] "We prefer the ignorance of Senator Smith to the knowledge of Mr. Ismay. Experts have told us the Titanic was unsinkable– <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> ignorance to such knowledge!" ...|$|E

In a later press release, Akinola clarified [...] "We want to state that our intention in amending the 2002 Constitution of the Church of Nigeria was to make clear that we are committed to the historic faith once delivered to the Saints, practice and the traditional formularies of the Church. ... We treasure our place within the worldwide family of the Anglican Communion but we are distressed by the unilateral actions of those provinces that are clearly determined to redefine what our common faith was once.

2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we {{have found a way}} to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes no difference in the experimental predictions. On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E
