25|$|Aristotle holds a teleological worldview: he {{sees the}} {{universe}} as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists {{for the sake of}} actuality. Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form, and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing. Now, each thing has certain potentialities {{as a result of its}} form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither. Hence, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the snake ought to slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.|$|E

On the other hand, there was clear proof of perjury and obstruction of justice which could be prosecuted in a relatively straightforward trial.|$|E

25|$|When {{a cluster}} of microparticles are trapped within a {{monochromatic}} laser beam, {{the organization of the}} microparticles within the optical trapping is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding forces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.|$|E
25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The {{lone pair of electrons}} moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth {{as long as they are}} close enough to the substrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{true power}} of STR {{analysis}} {{is in its}} statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are independently assorted (having {{a certain number of}} repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the product rule for probabilities can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches. Moreover, since there are about 12 million monozygotic twins on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how {{likely it is that}} we would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the suitcase is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E
25|$|The middle era {{history of}} Bharuch {{district}} {{can be divided}} in three main parts, out of which, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Sultanate era (1297–1572), Mughal era (1572–1736). Broach was a center of a prosperous merchant community, {{and was one of}} the chief ports of Gujarat from ancient times to the first half of the 16th century; the Portuguese had little contact with the port, until 1547 when Jorge de Menezes sacked Bharuch 1547, from which the city fell into insignificance. In the 17th century the Dutch and British made it a center of their cotton purchases in Gujarat, and commercial warehouses were established in 1616 and 1618 by the British and Dutch (Valanda) respectively. After that, in 1675 & 1686, it was sacked by the Maratha's. During this time period, Bharuch was handed over to Kutubuluddin. Mughal king Aurangzeb demolished the fortification and the fort in 1660 by attacking. Later on, he had built it again in 1686. In 1772, the Britishers again attacked on Bharuch with the help of 'Diwan Lallubhai' and they got succeed to take the power from 'Nawab Mojubb Khan'. Maratha era (1783–1802) were the eras of struggle. Bharuch was ruled by Delhi Sultanate for 94 years, Gujarat’s independent Sultanate for 181 years, Mughal Sultanate for 164 years, independent emirs for 36 years and Maratha rule for 19 years.|$|E
