25|$|This rather {{straightforward}} {{account of}} the Ring's origins, however, has been disputed {{by a number of}} authorities, who accuse Wagner of deliberately distorting the facts so as to bring them into harmony with his own private version of history. The actual sequence of events, it seems, was not nearly as clear-cut as he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> believe. It was in October 1846 – some sixteen months before the February Revolution – that he first drew up a plan for a five-act drama based on the life of Friedrich Barbarossa. He may even have considered writing an opera on Siegfried as early as 1843, when he read Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie (German Mythology), or possibly in 1844, when he borrowed several works on the Nibelungs from the Royal Library in Dresden. As for Die Wibelungen, it would appear that he only started work on this essay in December 1848 at the earliest, finishing it sometime before 22 February 1849, when he read it to his friend Eduard Devrient.|$|E

But Fodor complains that Pinker, Plotkin {{and other members of}} what he sarcastically calls [...] "the New Synthesis" [...] have taken modularity and similar ideas way too far.

500|$|The {{state of}} Utah signed a joint intent with the Navajo Nation and San Juan County in 1986 to {{construct}} a new highway to connect Bluff with Montezuma Creek. Businesses in Monument Valley asked the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to request extensions of US163 and US 666 using this new road. The proposal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>US</b> 163 run from Cedar City to US 160 near Cortez, Colorado along the routes of State Route 14, U.S. Route 89, Arizona State Route 98, U.S. Route 160, the current US163, the new road from Bluff to Montezuma Creek, and Colorado State Highway 41. The proposal for US666 would extend to Richfield via upgrades to State Route 95 and State Route 24. [...] UDOT submitted the proposal for [...] US666 to AASHTO, which was rejected. AASHTO cited that the route was not direct, and SR-24 was not built to U.S. Highway standards. UDOT did not pursue the extension of US163, even though the Utah state legislature had already approved the new road from Bluff to Montezuma creek as route 163.|$|E

[...] Rather, Gould pinpoints a powerful pair of metaphors—time's arrow and time's cycle—by which humankind has always tried to grasp the concept of time. Time's arrow captures the uniqueness and distinctive character of sequential events, whereas time's cycle provides these events with another kind of meaning by evoking lawfulness and predictability.|$|E

[...] Dershowitz disagrees with those who believe that the media is uncritical of Israel and cites the frequent New York Times editorials and even an editorial in The Jewish Daily Forward against some of Israel's more right of center policies as proof.

2500|$|When first discovered, {{particle}} diffraction was {{a source}} of great puzzlement. Are [...] "particles" [...] really [...] "waves?" [...] In the early experiments, the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a photographic plate, which could not detect individual particles. As a result, the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible, or complementary, in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them. That idea, however, was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological limitation. Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual electrons, and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of many small spots (Tonomura et al., 1989). Evidently, quantum particles are indeed particles, but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> to expect.|$|E
