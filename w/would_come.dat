6000|$|And he sang! It was soft, at first, and dreamy, {{telling of}} old Germany, {{the mother of}} nations, of the rich, warm plains, and the grey cities, and the fame of dead heroes. But then verse after verse rang like a trumpet-call. It was of the Germany of now, the Germany which had been taken unawares and overthrown, but which was up again, and {{snapping}} the bonds upon her giant limbs. What was life that one should covet it? What was glorious death that one should shun it? The mother, the great mother, was calling. Her sigh was in the night wind.

60|$|Such was the {{condition}} of Rome during {{the second year of}} the Triumvirate, in which Cæsar was Consul and prepared the way for the powers which he afterward exercised. Cicero <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> to his call; and therefore, as we are told, Clodius was let loose upon him. As he <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> to Cæsar's call, it was necessary that he should be suppressed, and Clodius, notwithstanding all constitutional difficulties--nay, impossibilities--was made Tribune of the people. Things had now so far advanced with a Cæsar that a Cicero who <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> to his call must be disposed of after some fashion.|$|R
