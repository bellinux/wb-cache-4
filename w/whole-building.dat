A deep energy retrofit typically results in savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value.|$|E
50|$|CABS is {{only one}} {{designation}} for a facade concept that can been described by a range of different terms. Several variations on the term ‘adaptive’ can be used, including: active, advanced, dynamic, intelligent, interactive, kinetic, responsive, smart and switchable. In addition, the concepts of responsive architecture, kinetic architecture, intelligent building are closely related. The main difference with CABS is that the adaptation {{takes place at the}} building shell level, whereas the other concepts consider a <b>whole-building</b> approach.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{underfloor}} heating systems use either electrical resistance elements ("electric systems") or fluid flowing in pipes ("hydronic systems") {{to heat the}} floor. Either type can be installed as the primary, <b>whole-building</b> heating system or as localized floor heating for thermal comfort. Electrical resistance can only be used for heating; when space cooling is also required, hydronic systems must be used. Other applications for which either electric or hydronic systems are suited include snow/ice melting for walks, driveways and landing pads, turf conditioning of football and soccer fields and frost prevention in freezers and skating rinks. A range of {{underfloor heating}} systems and designs are available to suit different types of flooring.|$|E

Deep energy retrofits {{can be applied}} to both residential and non-residential (“commercial”) buildings. A deep energy retrofit typically results in energy savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value. The Empire State Building has undergone a deep energy retrofit process that was completed in 2013. The project team, consisting of representatives from Johnson Controls, Rocky Mountain Institute, Clinton Climate Initiative, and Jones Lang LaSalle will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38% and $4.4 million. For example, the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into superwindows which block heat but pass light. Air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved $17 million of the project's capital cost immediately, partly funding other retrofitting. Receiving a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating in September 2011, the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States.The Indianapolis City-County Building recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process, which has achieved an annual energy reduction of 46% and $750,000 annual energy saving.|$|E

High-resolution <b>whole-building</b> numerical modelling can be used for detailed analysis of the potential consequences of climate change on buildings and to evaluate remedial measures. This discussion is certainly not intended to be complete. Rather it is intended to provide some views on climate change and built environment from a computational building physics perspective.

This paper shows the coupling of a hygrothermal <b>whole-building</b> simulation software with a three-dimensional dynamic thermal bridge simulation. The basics of the hygrothermal <b>whole-building</b> model and the thermal bridge model are explained.

40|$|Building America {{teams are}} researching {{opportunities}} to improve energy efficiency {{for some of}} the more challenging end-uses, such as lighting (both fixed and occupant-provided), appliances (clothes washer, dishwasher, clothes dryer, refrigerator, and range), and miscellaneous electric loads, which are all heavily dependent on occupant behavior and product choices. These end-uses have grown to be a much more significant fraction of total household energy use (as much as 50 % for very efficient homes) as energy efficient homes have become more commonplace through programs such as ENERGY STAR and Building America. As modern appliances become more sophisticated the residential energy analyst is faced with a daunting task in trying to calculate the energy savings of high efficiency appliances. Unfortunately, most <b>whole-building</b> simulation tools do not allow the input of detailed appliance specifications. Using DOE test procedures the method outlined in this paper presents a reasonable way to generate inputs for <b>whole-building</b> energy-simulation tools. The information necessary to generate these inputs is available on Energy-Guide labels, the ENERGY-STAR website, California Energy Commission's Appliance website and manufacturer's literature.

40|$|Commercial {{building}} retrocommissioning {{activity has}} increased in recent years. LBNL recently conducted a study of 8 participants in Sacramento Municipal Utility District's (SMUD) retrocommissioning program. We evaluated the persistence of energy savings and measure implementation, {{in an effort to}} identify and understand factors that affect the longevity of retrocommissioning benefits. The LBNL analysis looked at <b>whole-building</b> energy and the retrocommissioning measure implementation status, incorporating elements from previous work by Texas A&M University and Portland Energy Conservation Inc. When possible, adjustments due to newly discovered major end uses, occupancy patterns and 2001 energy crisis responses were included in the <b>whole-building</b> energy analysis. The measure implementation analysis categorized each recommended measure and tracked the measures to their current operational status. Results showed a 59 % implementation rate of recommended measures. The <b>whole-building</b> energy analysis showed an aggregate electricity savings of approximately 10. 5 % in the second post-retrocommissioning year, diminishing to approximately 8 % in the fourth year. Results also showed the 2001 energy crisis {{played a significant role in}} the post-retrocommissioning energy use at the candidate sites. When natural gas consumption was included in the analysis, savings were reduced slightly, showing the importance in considering interactive effects between cooling and heating systems. The cost effectiveness of retrocommissioning was very attractive at the sites studied. However, funding for retrocommissioning activities is still very constrained...|$|E
40|$|In hot {{and humid}} climates, where summers are both warm and humid, the latent cooling can be a {{significant}} portion of the total cooling load (as much as 40 %). Typically the monitored data only includes <b>whole-building</b> heating and cooling energy use and total electric consumption. A method to disaggregate the latent cooling energy use from the measured <b>whole-building</b> heating and cooling energy use would be of particular interest. This paper presents such a method and discusses its benefits. It is shown that the overall heat transfer coefficient including the conduction, infiltration, and ventilation effects of a building, can be evaluated. Subsequently this enables the disaggregation of the total cooling energy use into sensible and latent cooling fractions. The benefits of such a method include: (i) better understanding of the sensible and latent fractions in the total cooling energy use of a building, and (ii) better regression models for energy analysis. In addition to the <b>whole-building</b> cooling and heating energy use and the ambient conditions, the required system parameters include: (i) cold deck supply temperature, (ii) hot deck supply temperature, (iii) mixed air temperature or ventilation rate, (iv) internal gains, and (v) total mass flow rate of the dual duct constant volume system. If continuous measurements of the system parameters are not available, then one-time measurements may be used to disaggregate the latent cooling energy use...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel modeling methodology that integrates the near building environmental conditions (or microclimate), <b>whole-building</b> design, and occupant behavior.

This study bridges the gap between human factors and architecture to include physical, cognitive, and organizational systems into building information modeling using future typical meteorological year climate data, canyon air temperature microclimate model, and a <b>whole-building</b> energy simulation to investigate the impact of future microclimate conditions on a “typical” single-occupant office. Additionally, to capture the effects of building occupant decision-making and adaptive behaviors, an agent-based model is proposed.

40|$|Implementation {{of energy}} service {{projects}} {{continue to increase}} as building owners are faced with higher utility bills, rigorous environmental regulations, and shrinking capital allocation for such projects. Different techniques and guidelines are available to select and quantify energy service projects. These methods range from various Technical reference manuals (TRMs) developed by state agencies in conjunction with energy consultants to standard protocols developed by energy professional organizations. All of these methods require gathering or estimating representative input variables, with various approaches to data collection that vary from stipulation to measurement-based values. The methods to quantify the savings range widely from engineering algorithms to as-built calibrated <b>whole-building</b> energy simulation models. In this study, a comparison is made between the engineering algorithms supported by many TRMs and a more accurate as-built calibrated <b>whole-building</b> energy simulation model. The methods to performing the comparison included identifying industry methods through literature reviews, expert interviews, a desk audit of a typical utility assessment report, and constructing an as-built calibrated <b>whole-building</b> energy simulation model of a well-instrumented, large office building near the Texas A&M University campus. Lighting and lighting control energy conservation measures (ECMs) were selected to demonstrate the methodology. As {{part of the process}} of constructing the simulation model, a data collection protocol was also created. The data collection protocol included gathering building and site specific information including sub-hourly measured energy consumption data and measured climatic data for the baseline year. The study results showed that the industry methods of quantifying the total energy savings for lighting and lighting control ECMs were consistently under-reporting the savings as compared to the calibrated as-built <b>whole-building</b> energy simulation model. In particular, the breakdown of savings was inconsistent between the various industry methods that are currently in use. The differences were perceived to be location specific and weather driven and also included agreements with the local utility companies to quantify the demand savings. Finally, the study results also indicated that the current industry methods could be significantly improved by measuring the occupancy schedule and indoor temperature...|$|E

40|$|<b>Whole-building</b> energy {{models are}} used in {{practice}} to pre-dict energy and comfort for an entire building given its architec-tural and built state, external stimuli from weather, and internal behavior of both the equipment and occupants of the building.

Unfortunately, the dynamics of the building are masked in assumptions included in the numerical routines that are often intertwined within the thermal physics. Because of this, control-oriented analysis is limited to performing exhaustive time-based simulations. In this paper, we describe a method to analytically extract the dynamics from a <b>whole-building</b> energy simulator for the purpose of control and dynamical systems analysis. In this way, the function of the energy simulator is only a user inter-face and a means to organize information inherent in the dynam-ics (capacitances, interaction between elements of the building, etc.).
