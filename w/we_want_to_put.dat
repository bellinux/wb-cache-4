It's almost like Garbage-meets-pop-meets-Muse. It's a little different. I don't know how it's going to end up. Who knows?" [...] she said. [...] "It always ends up being something completely different." [...] On October 6, 2010, Clarkson hosted an impromptu session on the social networking site Twitter to update fans regarding {{the status of the}} album. Clarkson tweeted [...] "We've almost completed the album. We're gonna have way too many songs to pick from," [...] later adding that she hoped to release it in early 2011. Claude Kelly, who had previously worked with Clarkson on All I Ever Wanted, remarked [...] "Well, I wrote [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You" [...] for the last album, so we're trying to take it up a level", adding [...] "She's toured the world with that album. She's experienced stuff, so whatever she's going through right now — fun, good, the bad, the ugly — <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on that record." [...] During {{an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Clarkson remarked that unlike her previous records, such as My December (2007) and her previous single, [...] "Already Gone" [...] (2009), the recorded songs for Stronger didn't manage to spark a single conflict with her label RCA Records upon the album's release; she remarked [...] "Usually on most albums, I'll fight and be like 'No, this has to be a single.' There's no real fighting on this. The label and I, we all love them." [...] Clarkson remarked that Stronger was her best album to record. [...] "Everything was really fluid, and everyone agreed on it and that's a first." ...|$|E

"We {{must try}} to {{consider}} ourselves rather {{in the light of}} a telephone exchange--for the exchange of ideas, Miss Datchet," [...] he said; and taking pleasure in his image, he continued it.

5000|$|Adrian {{explains}} that [...] "our concept {{from the beginning}} of Neon Dreams was to bring live instrumentation back to it and make it about the band even though it is club music. We'd go to a show and it was all about the visual effects.

6000|$|This is {{also why}} general {{education}} should be suppressed as soon as possible. We have fallen {{into a state of}} fixed, deadly will. Everything we do and say to our children in school tends simply to fix in them the same deadly will, under the pretence of pure love. Our idealism is the clue to our fixed will. Love, beauty, benevolence, progress, these are the words we use. But the principle we evoke is a principle of barren, sanctified compulsion of all life. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all life under compulsion. [...] "How to outwit the nerves," [...] for example.--And therefore, to save the children as far as possible, elementary {{education should be}} stopped at once.|$|E

I think we took all the good that we liked from the past records and added the new touch that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on it, which was a heavier and darker theme." ...|$|R

5000|$|David Gilmour: [...] Clare Torry didn't {{really look}} the part. She was Alan Parsons' idea. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a girl on there, {{screaming}} orgasmically. Alan {{had worked with}} her previously, so we gave her try. And she was fantastic. We had to encourage her a little bit. We gave her some dynamic hints: [...] "Maybe you'd like to do this piece quietly, and this piece louder." [...] She did maybe half a dozen takes, and then afterwards we compiled the final performance {{out of all the}} bits. It wasn't done in one single take.|$|R

"I {{never could}} quite make out why <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a fort down {{so close to}} them, seeing as there warn't a {{settlement}} to protect within {{a hundred and fifty}} miles; but I suppose the wiseacres at Washington had some sort of an idea that the redskins would be afraid to make excursions to the settlements with this fort in their rear, just as if they couldn't make a sweep of five hundred miles if they took it into their heads, and come back into their country on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Korbel sold Kenwood Vineyards to New York-based Banfi Vintners, {{the makers}} of Riunite.

Said Heck, “Kenwood produces more than 550,000 cases of wine a year. It takes a lot of work and effort.

We want industry... <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the idle to work. Capital will find all the guarantee it needs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chabon was {{ambivalent}} about his new-found fame. He turned down offers {{to appear in}} a Gap ad and to be featured as one of Peoples [...] "50 Most Beautiful People."

5000|$|In {{comparing}} the record to the band's previous release, Accelerate, Mills {{noted that the}} band, [...] "wanted this new one to be more expansive. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> more variety into it and not limit ourselves to any one type of song. There are some really slow, beautiful songs; there are some nice, mid-tempo ones; {{and then there are}} three or four rockers." [...] He has spoken about the album's theme, saying: [...] "It's more of a personal record than a political one. Current events do come into our mind when we write, but the themes here are more universal." ...|$|R

50|$|In conclusion, if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all the {{disciplines}} {{as a necessary}} knowledge for the orator, Antonius disagrees, and prefers simply {{to say that the}} oratory needs not to be nude and without ornate; on the contrary, it needs to be flavoured and moved by a graceful and changing variety.A good orator needs to have listened a lot, watched a lot, reflecting a lot, thinking and reading, without claiming to possess notions, but just taking honourable inspiration by others' creations.Antonius finally acknowledges that an orator must be smart in discussing a court action and never appear as an inexperienced soldier nor a foreign person in an unknown territory.|$|E
