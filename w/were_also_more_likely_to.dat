5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E

25|$|According to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed {{criminal}} offenses as uncommon, {{but there}} are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes. Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> find peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding the effects of linguistic profiling relates to housing. A study at the University of Pennsylvania found that discrepancies existed not only between white speakers of Standard American English and black speakers of African American Vernacular English, but in addition in between females and males and speakers of Black Accented English and African American Vernacular English when applying for housing. African Americans as a whole <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be told {{about the problems of}} creditworthiness when applying for a lease. An explanation offered by {{the research}}er suggests the linkage between low socio-economic backgrounds and African American Vernacular English, while Black Accented English was associated with higher middle class status. Speech closer to the standard form yielded greater acceptance.|$|E
25|$|Murtagh (2003) {{investigated}} {{retention and}} attrition of L2-Irish in Ireland with second level school students. At Time 1, {{she found that}} most participants were motivated instrumentally, yet the immersion students {{were most likely to}} be motivated integratively and they had the most positive attitudes towards learning Irish. Immersion school students <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have opportunities to use Irish outside the classroom/school environment. Self-reports correlated with ability. She concludes that the educational setting (immersion schools, for example) {{and the use of the}} language outside the classroom were the best predictors for L2-Irish acquisition. Eighteen months later, Murtagh finds that the majority of groups 1 and 2 believe their Irish ability has attrited, the immersion group less so. The results from the tests, however, do not show any overall attrition. Time as a factor did not exert any overall significant change on the sample's proficiency in Irish (Murtagh, 2003:159).|$|E

25|$|Research {{indicated}} that BNP voters also held opinions that were {{distinct from the}} average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population. In the 2002–06 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration {{to be the most}} important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed. By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population. BNP voters <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> identify law and order, the EU, and Islamic extremism as the most important issues facing the UK than other voters, and less likely than average to rate the economy, NHS, pensions, and housing market as the most important.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{in sexual}} {{infidelity}} {{as a function}} of gender have been commonly reported. It is more common for men compared to women to engage in extradyadic relationships. The National Health and Social Life Survey found that 4% of married men, 16% of cohabiting men, and 37% of dating men engaged in acts of sexual infidelity compared to 1% of married women, 8% of cohabiting women, and 17% of women in dating relationships. These differences have been generally thought due to evolutionary pressures that motivate men towards sexual opportunity and women towards commitment to one partner. In addition, recent research finds that differences in gender may possibly be explained by other mechanisms including power and sensations seeking. For example, one study found that some women in more financially independent and higher positions of power, <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be more unfaithful to their partners. In another study, when the tendency to sensation seek (i.e., engage in risky behaviours) was controlled for, there were no gender differences in the likelihood to being unfaithful. These findings suggest there may be various factors that might influence the likelihood of some individuals to engage in extradyadic relationships, and that such factors may account for observed gender differences beyond actual gender and evolutionary pressures associated with each.|$|E
25|$|Problem {{benzodiazepine}} use can {{be associated}} with various deviant behaviors, including drug-related crime. In a survey of police detainees carried out by the Australian Government, both legal and illegal users of benzodiazepines were found to be more likely to have lived on the streets, less likely to have been in full-time work and more likely to have used heroin or methamphetamines in the past 30 days from the date of taking part in the survey. Benzodiazepine users <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be receiving illegal incomes and {{more likely to have been}} arrested or imprisoned in the previous year. Benzodiazepines were sometimes reported to be used alone, but most often formed part of a poly drug-using problem. Female users were more likely than men to be using heroin, whereas male users were more likely to report amphetamine use. Benzodiazepine users were more likely than non-users to claim government financial benefits and benzodiazepine users who were also poly-drug users were the most likely to be claiming government financial benefits. Those who reported using benzodiazepines alone were found to be in the mid-range when compared to other drug using patterns in terms of property crimes and criminal breaches. Of the detainees reporting benzodiazepine use, one in five reported injection use, mostly of illicit temazepam, with some who reported injecting prescribed benzodiazepines. The injection was a concern in this survey due to increased health risks. The main problems highlighted in this survey were concerns of dependence, the potential for overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with opiates and the health problems associated with injection of benzodiazepines.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{inspired}} {{a couple of}} academic case studies. [...] The first was a George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services case study {{about the effects of}} television writers consulting medical professionals on the storyline of a television episode. [...] Participants in a survey conducted by the University of Southern California and Purdue University felt that a black market for organs existed and that a person's place on the organ priority list can be influenced by money or fame. [...] They, as a result of [...] "Harvest", also were more likely to become organ donors or to consider doing so. [...] The second case study was about TV's influence on the discussion of organ donations. [...] Participants in a Hollywood Health & Society online survey <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> believe in the existence of black-market organ trafficking and were more likely to donate organs after watching [...] "Harvest".

500|$|Bell et al. {{found that}} {{homosexual}} {{men were more}} likely than heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers. Male respondents who were unusually close to their mothers were more likely to describe themselves as having been feminine children, but only a minority of boys with this kind of background became homosexual. Bell et al. concluded that male homosexuality is not the [...] "result of an unusually strong maternal identification", and that mothers have only a small influence on their sons′ psychosexual development. Homosexual men were less likely to give positive descriptions of their fathers, but more likely to have negative feelings toward their fathers, to dislike, hate, or fail to feel close to them, or to consider them hostile or detached. They <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> feel more similar to their mothers than to their fathers, or to prefer to be like their mothers. Bell et al. concluded that, [...] "Unfavorable relationships with fathers" [...] have a weak connection to [...] "gender nonconformity and early homosexual experiences".|$|E
500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, {{and it seemed to}} have no {{role in the development of}} sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, and to say that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a role in the development of female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, fantasy {{football}} team managers pour {{money into the}} industry themselves. Many fantasy leagues require an entry fee, which are used to fund prizes for the league winners. These fees and their resulting payoffs are typically small, and represent more of a transfer of wealth between players than contributions to the overall economy. However, fantasy {{football team}} managers <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to spend on other industries. When compared to non-fantasy sports fans, team managers are significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to purchase alcohol, airline tickets, and sports magazines. They <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to purchase fast food and soft drinks.|$|R
500|$|Few male {{respondents}} {{had engaged in}} childhood sex play, {{and it did not}} seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were less likely to report having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. Three variables (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less likely to feel attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more likely to feel sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual men were more likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had [...] "modest total effects". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began to feel that way during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual men were more likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation.|$|E

There are many studies that show proof of an intergenerational transmission of divorce, but this doesn't mean that having divorced parents will absolutely lead a child to divorce.

2500|$|According to a Baylor University study [...] "people with no {{religious}} affiliation {{were not statistically}} {{more likely to be}} in intermarriages than evangelical or mainline Protestants or people from other religions" [...] with one exception, Catholics. Catholics were twice as likely to be in an interracial marriage than the general population. It is speculated that {{the reason for this is}} twofold: the increasing diversity of the Catholic population (which has seen a huge influx of immigrants, Catholicism has sizable to significant number of adherents from many nationalities worldwide) and the fact that Catholics typically base their choice of parish on geography rather than on its ethnic or racial makeup which creates more opportunities for interracial mixing. [...] Jews <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> date interracially than Protestants.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a nationally}} {{representative}} online survey of 7,841 French adults {{carried out by}} IFOP in early 2011, 6.6% of respondents identified as homosexual (3.6%) or bisexual (3%), and 90.8% as heterosexual. Compared to the heterosexual population, the homosexual population was {{much more likely to}} be male, single, and younger than 65, as well as to be living alone, to be economically active and work in [...] "superior intellectual professions" [...] but have a smaller household income, and to be residing in big cities, especially in the region of Paris. The bisexual population had fewer statistically significant deviations from the heterosexual population, resembling the heterosexuals on some measures, homosexuals on others, or being at a midpoint on still some others. However, they were more likely to be aged 18–24 than the other two groups. Like homosexuals, they <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be single.|$|E
2500|$|The job {{characteristic}} studies primarily focus on perceived {{job characteristic}}s, which are measured subjectively. [...] Nevertheless, {{it has also}} been shown that objective measures of job characteristics, such as how challenging a job is (i.e., job complexity) can also influence the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] Specifically, job complexity partially mediates the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction, such that a high CSE individual with a complex job {{will be more likely to}} be satisfied with their job. Similar to job characteristics, there is more than one explanation for this relationship. [...] It could be that people high in core self-evaluation are attracted to more complex jobs because they see an opportunity for greater intrinsic rewards. [...] However, it could also be the case that those with high core self-evaluations simply perceive higher complexity in their jobs. [...] Judge et al. (2000) measured job complexity using job titles and confirmed both of these explanations; finding that individuals with high core self-evaluations not only perceived higher job complexity, but <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> hold complex jobs, which led to higher job satisfaction.|$|E
