2500|$|Leslie J. Hoppe, {{writing in}} 1987, submits that Dever's {{definition}} of temporal scope of Levantine archaeology excludes the Early Arab period (640-1099), the Crusader period (1099–1291), the Mamluk period (1250–1517) and the Ottoman period (1517-1918). However, Dever's {{definition of the}} temporal scope of the field in What Did the Biblical Writers Know, and <b>When</b> <b>Did</b> <b>They</b> Know It? (2001), indicates that Hoppe's critique is no longer valid. There, Dever writes that the time-frame of Levantine archaeology, [...] "extends far beyond the 'biblical period,' embracing everything from the Lower Paleolithic to the Ottoman period." ...|$|E

40|$|Resources are {{distributed}} unequally. Differences in wealth, prestige, education, freedom, or power are common, {{within and between}} families, organizations, social classes, countries, etc. Historians, social philosophers, sociologists, and psychologists have often been concerned how people deal with being disadvantaged: <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> consider their lot unjust and possibly suffer from it? <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> tend to act against perceived injustice? <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> put their lot into perspective and justify it? Theories of social conflict of revolution, and of envy have analyzed inequalities {{from the viewpoint of}} the disadvantaged. By contrast, relatively {{little is known about the}} perspective of the privileged. <b>Do</b> <b>they</b> enjoy their privileges; <b>do</b> <b>they</b> fear losing their advantages; <b>do</b> <b>they</b> deny or justify their favorable lot? Certainly, various doctrines of justice offer ample arguments that can be used by the advantaged to justify their privileges. But what happens if someone fails to justify his favorable lot without having to renounce his preferred principles of justice or the facts? In such cases, a person should experience conflict and feel uneasy about his advantages. We have begun research on this phenomenon of uneasiness caused by one 2 ̆ 7 s own privileges as well as on coping with it. Our first study, from which the data presented in this chapter stem, was focused on existential guilt. We conceive existential guilt as an intra- and interindividually varying disposition to react with feelings of guilt to perceived differences between one 2 ̆ 7 s own favorable lot or position (i. e., own privileges) and the unfavorable lot of others...|$|R
60|$|But {{if any one}} shall say, {{that the}} souls of good men in heaven cannot help us who are here on earth, I answer, <b>When</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> ascend into heaven, to find out that? If they had ever been there, friends, be sure {{they would have had}} better news to bring home than this--that those whom we have honoured and loved on earth have lost the power which they used to have, of comforting us who are {{struggling}} here below. That notion springs altogether out of a superstitious fancy that heaven is a great many millions of miles away from this earth-- which fancy, wherever men get it from, they certainly do not get it from the Bible. Moreover it seems to me, that if the saints in heaven cannot help men, then they cannot be happy in heaven. Cannot be happy? Ay, must be miserable. For what greater misery for really good men, than to see things going wrong, and {{not to be able to}} mend them; to see poor creatures suffering, and not to be able to comfort them? No, my friends, we will believe--what every one who loves a beloved friend comes sooner or later to believe--that those whom we have honoured and loved, though taken from our eyes, are near to our spirits; that they still fight for us, under the banner of their Master Christ, and still work for us, by virtue of his life of love, which they live in him and by him for ever.|$|E

60|$|Sect. 28. He that is {{nourished by}} the acorns {{he picked up}} under an oak, or the apples he {{gathered}} from {{the trees in the}} wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself. No body can deny but the nourishment is his. I ask then, <b>when</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> begin to be his? when he digested? or when he eat? or when he boiled? or when he brought them home? or when he picked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else could. That labour put a distinction between them and common: that added something to them more than nature, the common mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right. And will any one say, he had no right to those acorns or apples, he thus appropriated, because he had not the consent of all mankind to make them his? Was it a robbery thus to assume to himself what belonged to all in common? If such a consent as that was necessary, man had starved, notwithstanding the plenty God had given him. We see in commons, which remain so by compact, that it is the taking any part of what is common, and removing it out of the state nature leaves it in, which begins the property; without which the common is of no use. And the taking of this or that part, does not depend on the express consent of all the commoners. Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with others, become my property, without the assignation or consent of any body. The labour that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were in, hath fixed my property in them.|$|E

60|$|How {{fatal to}} the parvenu, {{throughout}} history, {{has been this}} respect for shoebuckles. Where, for instance, would the Empire of Napoleon have been, if Ney and Lannes had never sported {{such a thing as}} a coat-of-arms, and had only written their simple names on their shields, after the fashion of Desaix's scutcheon yonder?--the bold Republican who led the crowning charge at Marengo, and sent the best blood of the Holy Roman Empire to the right-about, before the wretched misbegotten imperial heraldry was born, that was to prove so disastrous to the father of it. It has always been so. They won't amalgamate. A country must be governed by the one principle or the other. But give, in a republic, an aristocracy ever so little chance, and it works and plots and sneaks and bullies and sneers itself into place, and you find democracy out of doors. Is it good that the aristocracy should so triumph?--that is a question that you may settle according to your own notions and taste; and permit me to say, I do not care twopence how you settle it. Large books have been written upon the subject in a variety of languages, and coming to a variety of conclusions. Great statesmen are there in our country, from Lord Londonderry down to Mr. Vincent, each in his degree maintaining his different opinion. But here, in the matter of Napoleon, is a simple fact: he founded a great, glorious, strong, potent republic, able to cope with the best aristocracies in the world, and perhaps to beat them all; he converts his republic into a monarchy, and surrounds his monarchy with what he calls aristocratic institutions; and you know what becomes of him. The people estranged, the aristocracy faithless (<b>when</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> ever pardon one who was not of themselves?)--the imperial fabric tumbles to the ground. If it teaches nothing else, my dear, it teaches one a great point of policy--namely, to stick by one's party.|$|E
60|$|The wonder was not unnaturally {{expressed}} that Kaspar had not smelled out the villain, especially {{as he was}} probably the educational albino, who taught him to write in the dark. On hearing of this, later, Kaspar told Lord Stanhope that he had smelled the man: however, {{he did not mention}} this at the time. To make a long story short, on October 17, 1829, Kaspar did not come to midday eating, but was found weltering in his gore, in the cellar of Daumer's house. Being offered refreshment in a cup, he bit out a piece of the porcelain and swallowed it. He had 'an inconsiderable wound' on the forehead; to that extent the assassin had effected his purpose. Feuerbach thinks that the murderer had made a shot at Kaspar's throat with a razor, that Kaspar ducked cleverly, and got it on the brow, and that the assassin believed his crime to be consummated, and fled, after uttering words in which Kaspar recognised the voice of his tutor, the possible albino. No albino or other suspicious character was observed. Herr Daumer, before this cruel outrage, had remarked, in Kaspar, 'a highly regrettable tendency to dissimulation and untruthfulness,' and, just before the attack, had told the pupil that he was a humbug. Lord Stanhope quoted a paper of Daumer's in the Universal Gazette of February 6, 1834 (Allgemeine Zeitung), in which he says that 'lying and deceit were become to Kaspar a second nature.' <b>When</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> begin to become a second nature? In any case Daumer clove to the romantic theory of Kaspar's origin. Kaspar left Daumer's house and stayed with various good people, being accompanied by a policeman in his walks. He was sent to school, and Feuerbach bitterly complains that he was compelled to study the Latin grammar, 'and finally even Cæsar's Commentaries!' Like other boys, Kaspar protested that he 'did not see the use of Latin,' and indeed many of our modern authors too obviously share Kaspar's indifference to the dead languages. He laughed, in 1831, says Feuerbach, at the popish superstition 'of his early attendants' (we only hear of one, and about his theological predilections we learn nothing), and he also laughed at ghosts. In his new homes Kaspar lied terribly, was angry when detected, and wounded himself--he said accidentally--with a pistol, after being reproached for shirking the Commentaries of Julius Cæsar, and for mendacity. He was very vain, very agreeable as long as no one found fault with him, very lazy, and very sentimental.|$|E
