5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Suetonius, {{a number}} of omens had foretold Domitian's death. Several days prior to the assassination, Minerva had {{appeared}} to the emperor in a dream. [...] She announced {{that she had been}} disarmed by Jupiter and could no longer give Domitian her protection. [...] According to an auspice he had received, the Emperor believed that his death would be at midday. [...] As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon. Apparently put at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees.

Graner left him, feet dangling above the floor, for almost five hours. Hilas also detailed events he had witnessed of Graner and some of his fellow soldiers sodomizing and otherwise abusing other detainees. These events were also detailed by other prisoners including some of the victims themselves. According to Hilas, Graner also [...] "repeatedly threw the detainees' meals into the toilets and said, 'Eat it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sven Anders Hedin, {{a medical}} doctor at the royal court, and married {{to one of the}} Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two {{statements}} which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom. [...] To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor {{on his way to the}} Queen's bed chamber. Gustav III asked Hedin <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: [...] "In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!" [...] in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned.|$|E
