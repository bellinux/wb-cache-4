5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors are ADEC {{pregnancy}} category D, {{and should}} be avoided in women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to become pregnant. In the U.S., ACE inhibitors must be labeled with a boxed warning concerning the risk of birth defects when taken during {{the second and third}} trimester. Their use in the first trimester is also associated with a risk of major congenital malformations, particularly affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous systems.|$|E
25|$|Analysts {{say that}} Lazcano's death does not signify {{the end of}} Los Zetas. As seen in other {{instances}} when top cartel leaders are taken out, fragmenting within the organizations occur, causing short-term violence. Los Zetas have a line of succession when leaders are arrested or killed, {{but the problem is}} that most of these replacements are younger, less-experienced members <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to resort to violence to maintain their reputation.|$|E

25|$|DDAVP is most {{efficient}} {{in children with}} nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal urine production greater than 130% of expected bladder capacity for age) and normal bladder reservoir function (maximum voided volume greater than 70% of expected bladder capacity for age). Other children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> candidates for desmopressin treatment are those in whom alarm therapy has failed or those considered unlikely to comply with alarm therapy. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Armenians in Azerbaijan live in territory controlled by the break-away region Nagorno-Karabakh. Non-official sources estimate that the number Armenians living on Azerbaijani territory outside Nagorno-Karabakh is around 2,000 to 3,000, and almost exclusively comprises persons married to Azeris or of mixed Armenian-Azeri descent. The number of Armenians <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> not married to Azeris and are not of mixed Armenian-Azeri descent are estimated at 645 (36 men and 609 women) {{and more than half}} (378 or 59 per cent of Armenians in Azerbaijan outside Nagorno-Karabakh) live in Baku and the rest in rural areas. They are likely to be the elderly and sick, and probably have no other family members. Armenians in Azerbaijan are at a great risk as long as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains unsettled.|$|E
25|$|The ICD-11 and DSM-5 {{are being}} {{developed}} {{at the start of}} the 21st century. Any radical new developments in classification are said to be more likely to be introduced by the APA than by the WHO, mainly because the former only has to persuade its own board of trustees whereas the latter has to persuade the representatives of over 200 different countries at a formal revision conference. In addition, while the DSM is a bestselling publication that makes huge profits for APA, the WHO incurs major expense in determining international consensus for revisions to the ICD. Although there is an ongoing attempt to reduce trivial or accidental differences between the DSM and ICD, it is thought that the APA and the <b>WHO</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to continue to produce new versions of their manuals and, in some respects, to compete with one another.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Ali Al-Ahmed, {{director}} of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes {{as a violation of}} the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: [...] "For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organisations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination.... While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion." [...] In July 2010, The Independent reported: [...] "Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012.... Should Saudi Arabia... send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games".|$|E
500|$|The Act is {{relatively}} short, divided into 5 sections, the fifth covering {{the extent of}} the Act and its commencement date. Section 1 covers the test to determine if something is obscene; an article is taken to be obscene if the entire article [...] "is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely,</b> having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it". The test is based on [...] "persons"; DPP v Whyte [...] AC 849 established that it was not sufficient for an individual to be depraved or corrupted, it must be that a significant number of people likely to read it would become corrupt. [...] "article" [...] is defined within Section 1 as anything containing material that is read or looked at, any sound recordings and any film or other picture record. A publisher, as used in the Act, is also defined in Section 1; [...] "publisher" [...] is taken to mean anyone who [...] "distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire", or [...] "in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record, shows, plays or projects it". The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 amended this section to include the transmission of the article electronically.|$|E
