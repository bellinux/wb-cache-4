40|$|AREVIEW of the {{literature}} (cf. Funk and Forward, 1949) reveals that soiled hatching eggs may be washed by several methods and with several washing agents with no detrimental effects on hatchability. However, no direct evidence is available to prove. or disprove the old notion (Lippincott and Card, 1939) that <b>washed</b> <b>eggs</b> tend to hatch poorly because the cuticle or bloom is removed, thereby causing increased evaporation-loss during incubation. Furthermore, {{even though it has}} been proved by several workers that <b>washed</b> <b>eggs</b> hatch equally as well as unwashed eggs, Marshall and Cruick-shank (1938) have provided the theoretical basis to suppose that <b>washed</b> <b>eggs</b> might hatch better than unwashed eggs. They reason that the removal of part of the cuticle by washing reduces the effective evaporating surface around the pores of the egg shell, thereby reducing evapora-tion loss. This should result in higher hatchability, as it has been shown (God-frey and Jaap, 1949) that eggs with a low evaporation weight-loss during incu-bation hatch better than do those eggs with a high evaporation weight-loss. This study was initiated to determine the effect of several methods of washing eggs on the cuticle of the egg shell as measured by 14 -day incubation weight...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the use}} of ultrasonic vibration as an aid to the dilute acid method of cleaning eggs. It is expected that ultrasonics could increase the efficiency of cleaning by reducing the length of time the eggs are exposed to the acid solution. To determine whether ultrasonics could be beneficial, penetration of the cleaning solution into the egg, shell thickness, shell cleanliness, interior quality, and microbial, organoleptic, and functional properties were measured. Shell penetration was less, as a result of ultrasonic vibration, when the egg and acetic acid solution were the same temperature (22 C) at time of washing than when the eggs were 22 C and the solution was either 12 or 32 C. When egg and cleaning solution were 22 C, no cleaning solution penetrated the shell after 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 sec of exposure but penetration increased after 160 and 320 sec of exposure. No differences (P>. 05) in shell thickness resulted from cleaning in 1, 2, or 3 % acetic acid with ultrasonic vibration for 30, 60, 120, and 240 sec, and the shell thickness of eggs so treated did not differ (P>. 05) from that of commercially <b>washed</b> <b>eggs.</b> All three solutions produced clean eggs at each exposure time, and their cleanliness was comparable to that of commercially <b>washed</b> <b>eggs.</b> No differences (P>. 05) in Haugh units were caused by length of exposure to the cleaning solution and by exposure to ultrasonics.

40|$|ABSTRACT Research was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of using a dilute acetic acid solution to clean eggs on quality, shell thickness, shell strength, microbiological population of the shell, organoleptic and functional properties. Egg shell thickness was decreased when the eggs were immersed in acetic acid. This resulted in a more rapid decline in interior quality and undoubtedly weakened the shell. The strength of the shell was equal to commercially <b>washed</b> <b>eggs</b> when up to 4 % acetic acid was used to wash the eggs. Oiling and/or refrigeration (7 °C.) were used to maintain AA quality for 21 days. The egg shell thickness did not decrease proportionally with increased percent acetic acid which indicated a rate limited reaction. If the acid solution was agitated, a more rapid removal of shell occurred. When the eggs were exposed to the acid for periods up to 4 minutes, no difference in amount of shell removed was found. Organoleptic evaluation of albumen from treated eggs indicated no differences could be detected when compared to fresh albumen. Microbial evaluation of the shell showed a {{decrease in the number of}} organisms on the shell attributable to the acid treatment.

40|$|Egg washing is {{currently}} not permitted within the European Union, with few exceptions. This is mainly {{because there are}} concerns that cuticle damage could occur during or after the washing process, {{as a result of}} a suboptimal operation. In this study, the cuticle coverage levels of 400 washed or unwashed eggs, derived from either a brown or a white egg laying flock at the end of lay, were compared. The eggs from older hens inherently have poorer cuticle coverage and as a result arguably constitute a greater risk to consumer safety if they are then washed. Thus, the effects of the washing procedure used in this study on cuticle quality were tested under the worst-case scenario. A standard Swedish egg washing process was used. The cuticle coverage of the eggs was assessed by a colorimeter by quantifying the color difference before and after staining with Tartrazine and Green S. The cuticle of an additional 30 eggs from each of the four groups was then visually assessed by scanning electron microscopy. The staining characteristics of the cuticle varied greatly within each group of eggs and showed that the washing process did not lead to cuticle damage. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that there was no irreversible damage to the cuticle of the <b>washed</b> <b>eggs</b> and that it was not possible to correctly assign the treatment (washed or not) based on a visual assessment.

Using a four-arm olfactometer connected to four odor sources - S. dentiventris eggs; hexane washed eggs; tobacco leaves; and tobacco leaves with eggs - the arrestment of female parasitoids with previous oviposition experience and without was individually verified. The time of permanence in each odor field was registered {{for a period of}} 15 minutes. Host discrimination, regarding age and previous parasitism, was tested using arenas, where females were exposed for 30 minutes, individually, to egg groups with different treatments. To evaluate age discrimination, three groups of eggs, previously washed with hexane, were employed in the following conditions: one day-old eggs; one-day brushed with 12 -days-old egg extract; 12 -days-old eggs with extract of one day-old eggs; and control (<b>washed</b> <b>eggs,</b> one day-old). The same procedure was done using five and eight days-old eggs jointly with control. Age-dependent egg discrimination was verified exposing four egg groups in the following treatments: parasitized, parasitized and washed with hexane, not parasitized, and not parasitized with extract of parasitized eggs. Olfactometer tests showed that inexperienced females remained more time next to tobacco leaves when compared to experienced ones. Experienced females responded to odors that emanated from eggs. Egg extracts did not promote age discrimination; however, non parasitized eggs, with extract of parasitized eggs were partially avoided. The results obtained indicate that G. gallardoi females might modify their responses upon contact with host.

40|$|A {{low level}} of {{bacterial}} contamination on an eggshell is important from both food safety and storage perspectives. A high number of bacteria present on the eggshell surface increases the chances of eggshell penetration and contamination of internal contents. Overall, food quality and sanitary processing conditions can be judged by Enterobacteriaceae populations. In chapter 2, {{no significant differences were}} detected in the Enterobacteriaceae counts of the eggshell surface or in the eggshell pores, of visibly clean eggs collected from Australian layer flocks at various stages of lay. Out of all eggs tested, 4. 51 % (14 / 310) eggshell samples were reported Salmonella positive. The rate at which Salmonella infected flocks produce Salmonella contaminated eggs is unclear. In chapter 3, the possible transmission of Salmonella from the environment to the egg was investigated with the help of longitudinal studies on commercial egg farms. Results indicated that the odds of an eggshell being positive for Salmonella were 91. 76, 61. 5 and 18. 2 times higher when faecal, egg belt and dust samples, respectively, tested positive for Salmonella. On other hand, a one log increase in the load of Salmonella detected in faecal, egg belt and in the floor dust samples, respectively, resulted in 35 %, 43 % and 45 % increase (p< 0. 001) in the odds of an eggshell testing positive for Salmonella. In chapter 4, the shedding of Salmonella in a single age commercial egg layer flock was also investigated at the onset of lay (18 weeks) followed by two longitudinal samplings at 24 and 30 weeks. At the age of 18 weeks, when the first sampling was performed, the prevalence of Salmonella in faeces was 82. 14 %. However, in later samplings, at the age of 24 and 30 weeks, the prevalence of Salmonella in faeces was significantly reduced (p< 0. 001) to 38. 88 % and 12. 95 % respectively. The prevalence of Salmonella in faeces collected from the low tier cages was significantly higher (p= 0. 009) as compared samples from the high tier cages. There are various methods to decontaminate the eggshell surface; egg washing is one of them. Egg washing can reduce the level of bacteria on the eggshell surface and horizontal transmission across the eggshell. However, egg washing can damage the cuticle which is the outmost layer on the eggshell surface. The effect of egg washing on Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) penetration was investigated using agar and whole egg penetration techniques. The results in chapter 5 indicated that eggshell penetration was higher in <b>washed</b> <b>eggs</b> as compared to unwashed eggs. Hence, appropriate attention is essential to make sure eggs are kept at appropriate storage and drying conditions after washing. Statistical analysis also indicated that eggshell penetration by S. Typhimurium was related to the incidence of various eggshell ultrastructural features such as cap quality, alignment, erosion, confluence, Type B bodies and cuticle cover. All the S. Typhimurium strains used in this study were able to survive on the eggshell surface and in egg internal contents 21 days after infection. Other egg industry associated Salmonella serovars such as S. Singapore, S. Adelaide, S. Worthington and S. Livingstone had the capacity to penetrate the eggshell. However, these serovars had little or no capacity to survive in the egg internal contents 21 days after inoculation (Chapter 6). Eggshell quality and safety are important for the consumer’s impression of the product. A good quality eggshell protects the egg internal contents from bacterial penetration. A cracked or damaged egg encourages bacteria to move across the eggshell. Mycoplasma synoviae (M. synoviae) {{have been found to be}} associated with poor egg shell quality. The association between egg shell quality parameters and the seroprevalence of M. synoviae in eggs collected from Australian commercial layer flocks was investigated in chapter 7. Seroprevalence of M. synoviae was found to be high at 69 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 41. 3 – 89. 0). Statistical analysis showed an association between serological status for M. synoviae and the incidence of egg quality parameters such as translucency, shell breaking strength, % shell reflectivity and shell deformation. Thus, M. Synoviae infection could compromise eggshell quality and as a consequence the eggs from M. Synoviae positive flocks may be at risk of becoming contaminated by potentially pathogenic bacteria. Thesis (Ph. D.)
