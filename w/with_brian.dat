5|$|As with The Quatermass Experiment, {{the film}} {{rights to the}} serial were {{purchased}} by Hammer Film Productions — in this case after they had only read the scripts, before the serial was even made. Titled Quatermass 2, the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by Val Guest, <b>with</b> <b>Brian</b> Donlevy starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the screenplay himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title Enemy from Space.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague <b>with</b> <b>Brian</b> Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and abuse of the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Belfast in November 1963, the group disbanded, so Morrison connected with Geordie Sproule again {{and played with}} him in the Manhattan Showband along with guitarist Herbie Armstrong.

5|$|Before Peter is {{preparing}} to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible.

5|$|Dunst {{made her}} screenwriting and directorial debut with the short film Bastard, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010 {{and was later}} {{featured}} at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.

Doyle died on 5 May 2006, and on 28 May the Jim Doyle Tribute Concert {{was played}} at the Basement in Sydney. Musicians {{included}} Renée Geyer, Billy Field, bandmate Loughnan, and Barry Leef, with proceeds benefiting Doyle's family.

5|$|In 1999, {{the band}} self-released an EP titled First Impressions {{which was the}} product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios <b>with</b> <b>Brian</b> Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them out of their cars. Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released Identity Crisis on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for Children and Families. More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued Identity Crisis, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Shearer {{appeared}} <b>with</b> <b>Brian</b> Hayes in four {{episodes of}} the BBC Radio 4 sitcom Not Today, Thank You, playing Nostrils, {{a man so}} ugly he cannot stand {{to be in his}} own presence.

On June 19, 2008, it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category. The date of the ceremony where his star will be put in place has yet to be announced.|$|E
5|$|In between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn {{formed a}} country cover band named Coffee Creek, along <b>with</b> <b>Brian</b> Henneman (later {{a member of}} The Bottle Rockets). Henneman {{impressed}} Uncle Tupelo, and {{he was invited to}} be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band. While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for their 1998 season, the Yankees replaced general manager Bob Watson <b>with</b> <b>Brian</b> Cashman. The club made many player acquisitions, gaining {{the services of}} third baseman Scott Brosius, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, and starting pitcher Orlando Hernández. The Yankees won 28 of their first 37 games—a stretch that concluded with a perfect game pitched by Wells—and by August were 76–27. The 1998 Yankees are considered by some writers {{to be among the}} greatest teams in baseball history, having compiled a then-AL record of 114 regular-season wins against 48 losses. After playoff series wins over the Texas Rangers and Indians, New York defeated the San Diego Padres in four consecutive World Series games for their 24th Series title.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of 2013, in order to rest his body and improve his chances of playing in the 2015 Rugby World Cup McCaw {{enforced}} the sabbatical clause in his NZRFU contract. As a result, he only played the latter rounds of Super Rugby, and missed the 2013 French Test Series. He later returned to captain the All Blacks as they successfully defended the Rugby Championship. During this campaign, McCaw equalled (<b>with</b> <b>Brian</b> O'Driscoll of Ireland and John Smit of South Africa) the record as captaining the most test matches (83). McCaw subsequently overtook this record when playing in Japan on 2 November 2013. Following the All Blacks victory over the Springboks in Ellis Park, McCaw has played and won at every major Rugby Test stadium.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of going}} to his physical, Peter goes out <b>with</b> <b>Brian,</b> Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe to eat steaks. When Lois finds out, she takes him to the doctor herself. The doctor pronounces him healthy, but fat. Peter takes this badly, even smashing a picture of Lois' family. Trying to salvage it, Lois discovers another child in the picture: a boy. She {{telephones}} her father Carter, who tells her she doesn't have a brother and quickly terminates the call, but she persists: she breaks into her parents' house. She finally learns that her brother Patrick has been shut away in a mental hospital for decades, ever since he suffered a nervous breakdown as a young child, upon walking in on his mother {{having an affair with}} Jackie Gleason.|$|E
