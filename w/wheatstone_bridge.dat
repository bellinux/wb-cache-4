[...] There are several ways that bridge topology is rendered in circuit diagrams. [...] The first rendering in figure 1.8 is the traditional depiction of a bridge circuit. [...] The second rendering clearly shows the equivalence between the bridge topology and a topology derived by series and parallel combinations.

[...] Wheatstone, on the other hand, was an academic with no interest in commercial ventures. [...] He intended to publish his results and allow others to freely make use of them. [...] This difference in outlook eventually led to a bitter dispute {{between the two men}} over claims to priority for the invention.

2500|$|One of E-meter's primary {{components}} is a <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{an electrical}} circuit configuration invented in 1833 {{that enables the}} detection of very small differences between two electrical impedances (in this case, resistance). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject's body {{and the other is}} a rheostat controlled by the operator. A small voltage from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subjects hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject's body changes during the counseling, the resulting changes in the small electric current are displayed in needle movements on a large analog panel meter. The dial face is without numbers because the absolute resistance in ohms is relatively unimportant, while the operator watches primarily for characteristic needle motions.

2500|$|Volney Mathison (chiropractor, radio engineer, psychologist, and hypnotist) {{built an}} EDA meter {{based on a}} <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge,</b> a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that {{projected}} {{an image of the}} needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an electropsychometer or E-meter, and it {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Mathison Electropsychometer". In Mathison's words, the E-meter [...] "has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts". Mathison recorded in his book, Electropsychometry, that the idea of the E-meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:p.64In 1950 ... I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared to me that the psychogalvanometer showed most promise.L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And I went out and looked at the existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didn’t do anything very much, police detectors didn’t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but it’s a current floating inside another current [...]. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, [...] [...] After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents ( [...] , [...] ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.|$|E
