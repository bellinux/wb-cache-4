5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children. It demonstrated that little <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> to address the fears and concerns of victims of traumatic events. As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> appropriately.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2014, Somali {{security}} forces and AMISOM troops launched another operation to remove Al-Shabaab from the remaining areas in southern Somalia under its control. According to Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, the government subsequently launched stabilization efforts in the newly liberated areas, which included Rab Dhuure, Hudur, Wajid and Burdhubo. However, there were continuing concerns that not enough <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> to revitalise and secure the newly liberated areas. By 26 March, the allied forces had liberated ten towns within the month, including Qoryoley and El Buur. UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay described the military advance as the most significant and geographically extensive offensive since AU troops began operations in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Effect {{systems are}} formal systems {{designed}} {{to represent the}} effects executing a function or method can have.

5|$|Strikebreakers {{made another}} attempt to move the streetcars into their carhouses {{to protect them from}} being vandalized. When rioters in the mob {{realized}} what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done,</b> they attacked the policemen protecting the strikebreakers, and the police clubbed the rioters to drive them back. The rioters fled, and the police resumed their attempt to move the cars only to have the rioters renew the attack. Strikebreakers opened fire on the crowd; four rioters were killed. Numerous injuries were reported, including among the policemen. The rioters eventually overpowered the police and strikebreakers and forced them to abandon their efforts.|$|E
5|$|While that {{construction}} <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done,</b> MDOT truncated US10 at Bay City in 1986; this {{removed the}} concurrency between US10 and US23 that existed since 1926. A {{few years later}} in 1992, the freeway concept for the northeastern LP was revived again when MDOT initiated plans to study and build a new US23 freeway from Standish northerly to Tawas City, Oscoda or Alpena. This proposal was brought up due to {{a high level of}} tourist traffic along the current routing since the mid-1960s. The FHWA mandated additional environmental studies for the project in 2000, and MDOT withdrew the proposals two years later.|$|E
5|$|HMS Fife (a Royal Navy County Class Destroyer) {{was on its}} {{way back}} to the United Kingdom when the {{hurricane}} struck, and was turned back to provide emergency aid to the island. Sailing through mountainous seas The Fife docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only outside help for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship's helicopter (called Humphrey) took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> and how to get assistance. This was the first time a Royal Navy ship had provided a public broadcast news service.|$|E

5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done.</b> But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E

Bacon did make a major contribution to the development of science in medieval Europe by writing to the Pope to encourage the study of natural science in university courses and compiling several volumes recording the state of scientific knowledge in many fields at the time. He described the possible construction of a telescope, but there is no strong evidence of his having made one.|$|E

After much environmental review and remediation to remove toxic substances, she was carefully sunk in May 2006, settling in an upright position at a depth accessible to recreational divers.

Courtney was soon involved in conspiracies to overthrow the UDA leadership. These however came to nothing as the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries saw the existing leadership swept aside. For his part, Courtney would go on {{to become part of the}} new leadership that emerged in the 1990s around Johnny Adair.|$|E

Coal mining <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in the watershed of Shamokin Creek by the early 1800s. In the early 1900s, coal mining, foundries, iron works, nail production, agriculture, silk mills, and woolen mills were the main industries in the watershed.
