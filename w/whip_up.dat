5|$|Stalin {{reacted to}} the growing {{strength}} of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad. He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books. According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the line was {{finished}} there were public calls from {{inside and outside the}} company for Helm to resign, mostly because of his support for a proposed Memphis branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from Bowling Green to Guthrie, Kentucky. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at Clarksville, Tennessee and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E

25|$|Hearst's use {{of yellow}} journalism {{techniques}} in his New York Journal to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> {{popular support for}} U.S. military adventurism in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1898 was also criticized in Upton Sinclair's 1919 book, The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism. According to Sinclair, Hearst's newspapers distorted world events and deliberately tried to discredit Socialists. Another critic, Ferdinand Lundberg, extended the criticism in Imperial Hearst (1936), charging that Hearst papers accepted payments from abroad to slant the news. After the war, a further critic, George Seldes, repeated the charges in Facts and Fascism (1947).|$|E
500|$|Tripp's {{second edition}} in 1987 {{discussed}} the first edition's reception. [...] He wrote that no sentence in it stirred such a [...] "hateful reaction" [...] as Tripp's comment that, [...] "When {{two men are}} excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that is fed from both sides often does <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> levels of eroticism that are very rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp accused his critic Hendin of using that sentence to wrongly portray him as maintaining that homosexuality is an inherently superior form of sexual expression. The sociologist Jonathan Dollimore described Tripp's account of psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality as an over-simplification bordering on parody.|$|E
500|$|As I Lay Dying entered Big Fish {{recording}} studio in Encinitas, California, US in January 2005 {{to record their}} third studio album. Shadows Are Security was released in June {{of the same year}} and debuted at No.1 on the Independent Albums chart. It was also the band's first release to enter the Billboard 200—at No.35—and sold about 275,000 copies. Wade Kergan of Allmusic called it [...] "one of the strongest releases of 2005," [...] and commented that new guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa make the band [...] "stronger." [...] Rod Smith of Decibel Magazine commented: [...] "Tim Lambesis's finely honed roar in bittersweet instrumental matrices augmented by occasional clean vocals by bass guitarist Clint Norris. Guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> a melodic cyclone on 'The Darkest Nights'." [...] By this time, guitarist Evan White had quit the band for personal reasons after his mother died. All the singing was done by Dave Arthur of Kings to You, because it sounded more powerful in the studio in comparison to Clint Norris's singing.|$|E

500|$|Roy {{was created}} by the author Frank S. Pepper, who had created the similar strip, Danny of the Dazzlers, but he only wrote four {{instalments}} of Roy of the Rovers, because of his commitments to another of his characters, Captain Condor. His role was taken by the strip's first artist Joe Colquhoun, who used the pen-name [...] "Stewart Colwyn". He was replaced after four-and-a-half years by Derek Birnage, the editor of Tiger, who had commissioned the strip. In 1960, in an attempt to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> publicity, it was announced that the footballer Bobby Charlton had taken over as writer, although in reality it was still written by Birnage (who claimed that he did consult with Charlton occasionally for story ideas). The longest-serving writer of the strip was Tom Tully, who began in 1969 on an intermittent basis and then continuously from 1974 {{until the end of the}} weekly comic in 1993. Ian Rimmer became the main writer for the strip during the Match of the Day years, until the magazine's closure in May 2001.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} was overwhelmingly positive, and Housewives {{was considered}} the breakout hit of the season. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the pilot a score of four stars out of four, calling it [...] "efreshingly original, bracingly adult and thoroughly delightful", and going {{on to say that}} [...] " [...] Housewives is a brightly colored, darkly comic take on suburban life, sort of Knots Landing meets The Golden Girls by way of Twin Peaks." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle thought that Desperate Housewives was [...] "a brilliantly conceived and relentlessly entertaining new drama". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commented that the series had [...] "marvelous tonal elasticity". Peter Schorn of IGN felt that season one was [...] "blessed with an attractive cast (sing the praises of older women!), sharp writing and a funky vibe of its own" [...] and that [...] "Desperate Housewives was able {{to take some of the}} oldest formulas in the book and infuse them with their own subversive twists to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> a frothy confection of sly wit and dark motives." [...] Schorn gave the season a score of 9 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, {{candidates}} for the Referendum Party stood in 547 constituencies, the most that any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. None of these candidates were in Northern Ireland. This was because Goldsmith had made an agreement with Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist Party {{that he would not}} field any candidates against them if their one MEP joined his Europe of Nations grouping in the European Parliament, something that ensured that the grouping remained large enough to retain its Parliamentary funding. It also avoided putting up candidates in constituencies where the leading candidate (65 of them Conservatives, 26 Labour and 2 Liberal Democrats) was considered sympathetic to the Referendum Party's call for a referendum. Goldsmith appeared to acknowledge that it was unlikely to win any of the contested seats, stating that the party's success would be [...] "judged solely by its total number of votes". The party officially launched its electoral campaign on 9 April 1997 at Newlyn in Cornwall, where Goldsmith sought to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> Eurosceptic sentiment among fishermen who were angry with the restrictions imposed by EU fishing quotas.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels {{was one of the most}} enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: [...] "ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing." [...] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing [...] "war panic" [...] in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.|$|E
500|$|Early puberty {{and early}} {{masturbation}} are seen by Tripp as {{important factors in}} the development of male homosexuality, albeit not direct causes. He maintains that homosexual men tend to start masturbating earlier than heterosexual men, continue to masturbate more extensively {{for the rest of their}} lives, and also tend to have a larger than average penis size. Tripp sees early sexual experiences with persons of the same sex as having only a limited role {{in the development of}} male homosexuality. While he observes that homosexual men vary in their sexual attitudes, Tripp writes that, [...] "when two men are excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that is fed from both sides often does <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> levels of eroticism that are rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp considers promiscuity [...] "relatively prevalent" [...] among homosexual men as a group, though he noted that not all homosexual men are promiscuous. Tripp maintains that heterosexual men would be as promiscuous as homosexual men if they had the same level of opportunity. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality, writing that Kinsey and his associates found no evidence of their effectiveness. Tripp writes that a [...] "New York psychiatrist who for a number of years has headed a large psychoanalytic research program on homosexuality" [...] admitted to Pomeroy that he knew of only one patient he had helped to become heterosexual but was on such poor terms with him that he did not feel free to contact him so that he could verify his claim to have changed his sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|Neil Pigot, who {{did some}} {{work with the}} group, {{describes}} their style as [...] "a sort of extension of the Python tradition, but very much in an Australian context." [...] He says that DAAS were [...] "crucially important" [...] {{in the development of}} Australian comedy, directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as The D-Generation, Fast Forward and Wogs Out of Work. At the time DAAS emerged, Pigot says, comedy in Australia was dominated by joke-tellers and impersonators. [...] By contrast, DAAS were belligerent and confrontational, frequently attacking topical issues, invading people's personal space and involving the audience in their act. Mark Trevorrow, who frequently collaborated with the group, described their work as [...] "true genius." [...] "Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I've witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst," [...] he said. [...] "They'd <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> an audience and appeal to people's darker side. [...] It was very Dada, what they were doing. [...] And what happens with that is you're just as often likely to have people who want to kill you as applaud you." [...] In addition, ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group {{played an important role in}} raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas, particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular. British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988, [...] "they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched." [...] Murray described the All Stars as [...] "an insanely hot act from Oz who sang, cursed, sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s." ...|$|E
