40|$|Abandoned {{mines and}} mining-related {{activities}} typically cause environmetal {{problems related to}} erosion and pollutant transport. Traditional methods of smelter reclamation plan design are hampered {{by the lack of}} data integration and by time-consuming analysis. The proposed spatial decision-support system will minimize these problems as data integration and analysis are offered within one computerized environment. A geographical information system (GIS), remotely sensed data, erosion modeling, and multicriteria decisionmaking (MCDM) methods have been integrated to support reclamation procedures better. Integration of the digital data sources and analysis will produce more realistic, up-to-date models of damaged lands. This methodology is applicable to any number of damaged sites, including mine <b>sites,</b> smelter <b>sites,</b> <b>widespread</b> hazardous-waste <b>sites,</b> and areas negatively impacted by intense agriculture or forestry. The system has been tested at the Anaconda smelter site, an Environmental Protection Agency superfund site near Butte, Montana.

40|$|Orphanin FQ (OFQ, Nociceptin) is a {{recently}} discovered 17 -amino acid neuropeptide that is structurally {{related to the}} opioid peptides but does not bind opioid receptors. OFQ has been proposed {{to act as an}} anti-opioid peptide, but its <b>widespread</b> <b>sites</b> of action in the brain suggest that it may have more general functions. Here we show that OFQ {{plays an important role in}} higher brain functions because it can act as an anxiolytic to attenuate the behavioral inhibition of animals acutely exposed to stressful/anxiogenic environmental conditions. OFQ anxiolytic-like effects were consistent across several behavioral paradigms generating different types of anxiety states in animals (light-dark preference, elevated plus-maze, exploratory behavior of an unfamiliar environment, pharmacological anxiogenesis, operant conflict) and were observed at low nonsedating doses (0. 1 – 3 nmol, intracerebroventricular). Like conventional anxiolytics, OFQ interfered with regular sensorimotor function at high doses (> 3 nmol). Our results show that an important role of OFQ is to act as an endogenous regulator of acute anxiety responses. OFQ, probably in concert with other major neuropeptides, exerts a modulatory role on the central integration of stressful stimuli and, thereby, may modulate anxiety states generated by acute stress...|$|E
40|$|The asterinid {{sea star}} Parvulastra exigua (Lamarck) {{is a common}} member of {{temperate}} intertidal marine communities from geographically <b>widespread</b> <b>sites</b> around the southern hemisphere. Individuals from Australian populations lay benthic egg masses (through orally directed gonopores) from which nonplanktonic offspring hatch and metamorphose without a dispersing planktonic larval phase. Scattered reports in the taxonomic literature refer to a similar form in southern Africa with aborally directed gonopores (and possibly broadcast spawning of planktonic eggs and larvae); such differences {{would be consistent with}} cryptic species variation. Surveys of morphology and mtDNA sequences have revealed cryptic species diversity in other asterinid genera. Here we summarize the taxonomic history of Lamarck’s "Astérie exiguë" and survey morphological variation (the location of the gonopores) for evidence that some P. exigua populations include cryptic species with a different mode of reproduction. We found strong evidence for multiple species in the form of two phenotypes and modes of reproduction (oral and aboral gonopore locations) in populations from southern Africa and islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Both modes of reproduction have broad geographic ranges. These results are consistent with previously published genetic data that indicate multiple species in African and island (but not Australian) populations...|$|E

Consequently, relationships between host diversity, host abundance, and parasite infection are important aspects of disease ecology and conservation research. Here, {{we report on the}} prevalence patterns of avian Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infections and host relative abundance influence based on sampling 728 wild-caught birds representing 124 species at seven geographically <b>widespread</b> <b>sites</b> in southern China. The overall prevalence of two haemoprotozoan parasites, Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, was 29. 5 %, with 22. 0 % attributable to Haemoproteus and 7. 8 % to Plasmodium. Haemoproteus prevalence differed significantly among different avian host families, with the highest prevalence in Nectariniidae, Pycnonotidae and Muscicapidae, whereas Plasmodium prevalence varied significantly among host species. Seventy-nine mitochondrial lineages including 25 from Plasmodium and 54 from Haemoproteus were identified, 80 % of which were described here for the first time. The phylogenetic relationships among these parasites indicated stronger host-species specificity for Haemoproteus than Plasmodium. Well-supported host-family (Timaliidae) specific clades were found in both Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. The Haemoproteus tree shows regional subclades, whereas the Plasmodium clades are "scattered" among different geographical regions. Interestingly, there were statistically significant variations in the prevalence of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus among the geographical regions. Furthermore, the prevalence of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus were not significantly correlated with host relative abundance. Further efforts will focus on exploring the relationships between parasite prevalence and sex, age, and immune defense of the host...|$|E

40|$|CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) is a {{transcription}} factor involved in creating {{and maintaining the}} adipocyte phenotype. We have shown previously that insulin stimulates dephosphorylation of C/EBPα in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Studies to identify the insulin-sensitive sites of phosphorylation reveal that a C/EBPα peptide (amino acids H 215 to K 250) is phosphorylated on T 222, T 226, and S 230 in vivo. The context of these phosphoamino acids implicates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK 3), whose activity {{is known to be}} repressed in response to insulin, as a potential kinase for phosphorylation of T 222 and T 226. Accordingly, GSK 3 phosphorylates the predicted region of C/EBPα on threonine in vitro, and GSK 3 uses C/EBPα as a substrate in vivo. In addition, the effect of pharmacological agents on GSK 3 activity correlates with regulation of C/EBPα phosphorylation. Treatment of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes with the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase inhibitor wortmannin results in phosphorylation of C/EBPα, whereas treatment with the GSK 3 inhibitor lithium results in dephosphorylation of C/EBPα. Collectively, these data indicate that insulin stimulates dephosphorylation of C/EBPα on T 222 and T 226 through inactivation of GSK 3. Since dephosphorylation of C/EBPα in response to lithium is blocked by okadaic acid, strong candidates for the T 222 and T 226 phosphatase are protein phosphatases 1 and 2 a. Treatment of adipocytes with insulin alters the protease accessibility of <b>widespread</b> <b>sites</b> within the N terminus of C/EBPα, consistent with phosphorylation causing profound conformational changes. Finally, phosphorylation of C/EBPα and other substrates by GSK 3 may be required for adipogenesis, since treatment of differentiating preadipocytes with lithium inhibits their conversion to adipocytes...|$|E
40|$|Mauritia flexuosa L. f. {{is one of}} {{the more}} widely {{distributed}} neotropical palms and is intensively used by humans. This palm can grow in tropical rainforests or can develop a particular type of virtually monospecific communities restricted to warm and wet lowlands of the Orinoco and Amazon basins. It has been proposed that, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Mauritia swamp communities were restricted to the core of the Amazon basin from where they expanded favoured by the Holocene warmer and wetter climates. It has also been suggested that some of these palm communities might have been the result of human dispersal during the last millennia. Here, we evaluate both hypotheses using the case study of the Venezuelan Gran Sabana (GS) region, where the M. flexuosa swamp communities (locally called morichales) are common and well developed. The morichales did not reach the GS until the last 2000 years, as manifested by sudden increases of Mauritia pollen parallelled by similar trends in charcoal particles as proxies for fire. During the last two millennia, the situation was very similar to the present, characterised by extensive burning practices affecting savannas and savanna–forest ecotones but rarely morichales (selective burning). This strongly suggests that human activities could have been responsible for the penetration of the morichales to the GS. A meta-analysis of the available records of Mauritia pollen across northern South America shows that this palm has been present in the region since at least the last four glacial cycles. During the LGM, Mauritia was likely restricted to few but <b>widespread</b> <b>sites</b> of favourable microclimatic conditions (microrefugia) from where the palm expanded during the Holocene. During the last 2000 years, Mauritia underwent a remarkable expansion in northern South America, which includes the GS.

40|$|Low {{level and}} {{variable}} transgene expression plague efforts {{to produce and}} characterize transgenic lines in many species. When transformation efficiency is high, productive transgenic lines can be generated with reasonable effort. However, most efforts to date in mosquitoes have resulted in suboptimal levels of transformation. This, coupled with the large space and intensive labor requirements of mosquito colony maintenance makes the optimization of transformation in mosquitoes a research priority. This study proposes two strategies for improving transgene expression and transformation efficiency. The first is to explore exogenous promoter/enhancer combinations to direct expression of either the transgene itself, or the transposase required for insertion of the transgene into the genome. An extension of this strategy is to investigate {{the use of a}} powerful viral transactivating protein and its cognate enhancer to further increase expression of these targets. The second strategy involves the identification of an endogenous boundary element for use in insulating transgenes and their associated regulatory elements. This would mitigate the inappropriate expression or silencing of many transgenes inserted into ??????unfavorable?????? genomic environments as a consequence of an inability to specifically target the integration of transposons currently used in mosquito transgenesis. The IE 1 transactivating protein and its cognate enhancer from a baculovirus were shown to significantly increase expression of a reporter gene from three different promoters in cultured mosquito cells. Other heterologous enhancer/promoter combinations resulted in minimal increases or insignificant changes in expression. Orthologues of the vertebrate insulator-binding factor, CTCF, were cloned and characterized in two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. The expression profile of mosquito CTCF is consistent with its role as a putative insulatorbinding protein. Preliminary binding site studies reveal a C/G-rich binding site consistent with that known in vertebrates and indicate that CTCF may bind <b>widespread</b> <b>sites</b> within mosquito genomes...|$|E
