No professional artist of our standing would condescend to receive such an amount. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had been taken for a ride." ...|$|E
500|$|The Jackson family {{gathered}} around a radio to hear the song broadcast for the first time. Michael Jackson — who was 9 {{years old at the}} time — said of the experience, [...] " [...] all laughed and hugged one another. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had arrived." [...] The single [...] "Big Boy" [...] did not appear on any of Billboards music charts but sold in excess of 10,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E

500|$|For Diệm and his family, {{the failed}} coup {{was a turning}} point in {{relations}} with the US support, which had generally been unconditional and strong since 1955. He felt the US had let him down and that some Americans had been encouraging his overthrow and undermining his rule. He had previously though the Americans had full support for him, but afterwards, he told his confidants that he felt like Syngman Rhee, the President of the anti-communist South Korea who had been strongly backed by Washington until being deposed in a coup earlier in 1960, a regime change Diệm saw as US-backed. Diệm's opponents felt the same way about the similarities to Korea. Lieu later told Kahin [...] "We had no worry about getting continued American assistance if we were successful; <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could count on it, just like Park did when he overthrew Rhee." [...] Kahin also wrote that several senior officers including a senior figure in the coup, whom he did not name, were [...] "explicit in charging American encouragement of the rebels".|$|E
500|$|The band {{feared that}} {{following}} the overt rock of the War album and tour, {{they were in}} danger of becoming another [...] "shrill", [...] "sloganeering arena-rock band". The group were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to the Who and Led Zeppelin, but according to Bono: [...] "something just didn't feel right. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had more dimension than just the next big anything, we had something unique to offer." [...] Thus, they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, The Unforgettable Fire. Clayton said, [...] "We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty." [...] The Edge admired the ambient and [...] "weird works" [...] of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record. Island Records founder Chris Blackwell initially tried to discourage them from their choice of producers, believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would [...] "bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense".|$|E
500|$|Following the divestment, Walsh joined Grand Met's US-headquartered food {{division}} as CFO. In 1989, Grand Met {{used the}} proceeds from the Intercontinental sale to initiate a hostile takeover of Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant and Häagen-Dazs brands, for $5.7 billion. The Grand Met offer was held by analysts to be a generous one for a struggling company that was under-performing in its industry. Walsh subsequently admitted to overvaluing the Green Giant vegetables division. Grand Met was attempting to diversify, and was attracted to Pillsbury's brands, which they believed held under-exploited potential for international growth. Writing in Businessweek, Mark Maremont accused Pillsbury of being [...] "lax" [...] in exploiting Häagen-Dazs' potential overseas. Walsh said: We thought Pillsbury had powerful brands, but it had kind of lost its way. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could leverage its brands and its technologies. They had under-resourced their R and done {{a number of things}} to make the number, make the number. Cost reduction is a way of life, {{but you have to be}} responsible about it. You have to protect the seed today because that will be the tree that bears fruit in the future. I don't think Pillsbury had done that.|$|E

500|$|In April 2014, it was {{announced}} that Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films and Crystal Lake Entertainment were planning to produce an hour-long Friday the 13th television series. The series is intended to focus on a group of characters at Crystal Lake, who {{have to deal with the}} return of Jason Voorhees, as well as discover new information about him and his family. On August 2015, it {{was announced}} that the series was being developed by The CW. Steve Mitchell and Craig Van Sickle were hired to write the pilot, while Sean S. Cunningham, Randall Emmett, George Furla and Mark Canton would be the executive producers. On August 2016, the network announced that decided to not move forward with the series. The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, “We had better pilots. The bottom line is <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had stronger things to go with, and we didn’t go forward with it. It was well-written, it was darker than we wanted it to be, and we didn’t believe it had sustainability... We didn’t believe that it was a sustainable script, a sustainable series. It was a very good pilot, but not a sustainable series." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1880, an Australian side captained by Billy Murdoch toured England. The {{tourists}} {{had difficulty}} finding good opponents; most county sides turned them down, although Yorkshire played two unofficial matches against them. There {{was a lot}} of bad will, exacerbated by the Australians' arrival in England at short notice, to some extent unexpectedly. [...] This was heightened by an English perception that the Australians came frequently to maximise their profits; at the time, professionalism was frowned upon. [...] In his autobiography Lord Harris wrote, [...] "They asked no-one's goodwill in the matter, and it was felt this was a discourteous way of bursting in on our arrangements; and the result was they played scarcely any counties and were not generally recognised ... <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had to make a protest against too frequent visits". Harris initially shunned the team and tried to avoid correspondence and meetings with them. An attempt to arrange a game against an English XI for the Cricketers' Fund was turned down, and public advertisements in the newspapers were shunned. W.G. Grace was sympathetic to the Australians and felt that they were not to blame for the riot. He attempted to arrange a game for them at Lord's, but was rebuffed by the Marylebone Cricket Club, who gave the excuse that the ground was not available.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E

2500|$|Lea also {{revealed}} in a 1976 fan club interview: [...] "We {{just got a}} terrific buzz when {{we were working on}} the album. We were more relaxed than we've ever been, more willing and able to be more experimental in the studios, and we took it easy and relaxed. Certainly <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had a good product in the making, so it seemed right to put everything we had into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the live}} video, Ament said, [...] "Initially, {{it was a}} problem in terms of talking the record company into taking it seriously...That people didn't think we could pull it off made us want to do it even more. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could do a better version of it. Sonically, it's an {{inferior}} version of the song. But it's live." [...] The video was nominated for Best Alternative Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Palin as Jack Lint. Robert De Niro {{read the}} script and {{expressed}} interest in the role, but Gilliam had already promised the part to Palin, a friend and regular collaborator. Palin described the character as [...] "someone who was everything that Jonathan Pryce's character wasn't: he's stable, he had a family, he was settled, comfortable, hard-working, charming, sociable – and utterly and totally unscrupulous. That was the way <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could bring out the evil in Jack Lint." ...|$|E

2500|$|In between tours, Holder and Lea {{got down}} to what Holder called some [...] "serious writing". In mid-1975, the band booked {{themselves}} into New York's Record Plant and recorded the album Nobody's Fools. Speaking in a 1976 fan club interview, Holder said of recording an album in America: [...] "The album is why {{we went to the}} States, not for tax reasons, folks! We wanted to get fresh ideas, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> were getting a bit stale living in England." [...] For the album, songwriters Holder and Lea drew much inspiration from living in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 May 2007, Iran and the IAEA vehemently denied {{reports that}} Iran had blocked IAEA {{inspectors}} when they sought {{access to the}} Iran's enrichment facility. On 11 March 2007, Reuters quoted International Atomic Energy Agency spokesman Marc Vidricaire, [...] "We have not been denied access at any time, including {{in the past few}} weeks. Normally we do not comment on such reports but this time <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had to clarify the matter... If we had a problem like that we would have to report to the [...] board...

2500|$|He {{was known}} for his essays, most {{particularly}} The Power of the Powerless, in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to [...] "live within a lie" [...] under the communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: [...] "...we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> ought to do, and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bedouins {{had long}} {{standing}} ties with nearby Jewish communities. [...] Bedouins of Tuba-Zangariyye helped defend these {{communities in the}} 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Formal co-operation between Jews and Bedouin began in 1946, when tribal leader Sheik [...] Hussein Mohammed Ali Abu Yussef of the al-Heib tribe sent more than 60 of his men to fight alongside Zionist forces, forming the Pal-Heib unit of the Haganah. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Pal-Heib unit defended Jewish communities in the Upper Galilee against Syria. [...] Sheik Abu Yussef was quoted in 1948 as saying, [...] "Is it not written in the Koran that the ties of neighbors are as dear as those of relations? Our friendship with the Jews goes back many years. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could trust them and they learned from us too".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, {{the series}} chose {{to revisit the}} Luke and Laura rape storyline of the 1970s by having the {{incident}} revealed to Lucky. The controversial story of Luke raping Laura had quickly been renounced to a seduction at the time, after facing pressure from fans of the newly popular couple. In 1998, Pat Fili-Krushel, then President of Daytime Programming for ABC Daytime, explained to The New York Times: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> should investigate is how, as the famous saying goes, {{the sins of the}} father are visited on the children."
