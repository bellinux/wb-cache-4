40|$|Abridged) We {{consider}} {{dynamics and}} turbulent interaction of <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> {{within the framework}} of inertialess electron MHD (EMHD). We argue there is no energy principle in EMHD: any stationary closed configuration is neutrally stable. We consider the turbulent cascade of <b>whistler</b> <b>modes.</b> We show that (i) harmonic whistlers are exact non-linear solutions; (ii) co-linear whistlers do not interact (including counter-propagating); (iii) waves with the same value of the wave vector, k_ 1 =k_ 2, do not interact; (iv) <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> have a dispersion that allows a three-wave decay, including into a zero frequency mode; (v) the three-wave interaction effectively couples modes with highly different wave numbers and propagation angles. In addition, linear interaction of a whistler with a single zero-mode can lead to spatially divergent structures via parametric instability. All these properties are drastically different from MHD, so that the qualitative properties of the Alfven turbulence cannot be transferred to the EMHD turbulence. We derive the Hamiltonian formulation of EMHD, and using Bogolyubov transformation reduce it to the canonical form; we calculate the matrix elements for the three-wave interaction of whistlers. We solve numerically the kinetic equation and show that, generally, the EMHD cascade develops within a broad range of angles, while transiently it may show anisotropic, nearly two dimensional structures. Development of a cascade depends on the forcing (non-universal) and often fails to reach a steady state. Analytical estimates predict the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations for the quasi-isotropic cascade ∝ k^- 2. The cascade remains weak (not critically-balanced). The cascade is UV-local, while the infrared locality is weakly (logarithmically) violated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical model for electrostatic lower hybrid waves excited by electromagnetic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves propagating in {{regions of the}} magnetosphere and the topside ionosphere, where small-scale magnetic-field-aligned plasma density irregularities are thought to exist. In this model, the electrostatic waves are excited by linear mode coupling as the incident electromagnetic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves scatter from the magnetic-field-aligned plasma density irregularities. Results indicate that high-amplitude short-wavelength (5 to 100 m) quasi-electrostatic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves can be excited when electromagnetic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves scatter from small-scale planar magnetic-field-aligned plasma density irregularities in the topside ionosphere and magnetosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{dispersion}} equation for a <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> propagation {{in a warm}} plasma, {{subjected to}} parallel static electric and magnetic fields, is derived by using a linearized coupled Vlasov-Maxwell equation. From the derived dispersion equation, the amplitude constant a and phase constant [beta] of the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> are {{expressed in terms of}} static electric field E 0, static magnetic field B 0, the electron number density N 0, the electron temperature and the wave angular frequency [omega]. The effect of a weak static electric field on the propagation of a <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> is investigated in detail; the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> may be amplified or attenuated according to whether E 0 and B 0 are in the same direction or in the opposite direction. The spatial rate of change of the wave amplitude and phase velocity of the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> increase with |E 0 | in general. For a low-frequency wave propagation, a is directly proportional to E 0, [omega], and N 0, and inversely proportional to B 03. A <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> propagation in the magnetosphere is also considered.

40|$|Understanding the {{thermodynamic}} {{state of}} the hot intracluster medium (ICM) in a galaxy cluster requires {{a knowledge of the}} plasma transport processes, especially thermal conduction. The basic physics of thermal conduction in plasmas with ICM-like conditions has yet to be elucidated, however. We use particle-in-cell simulations and analytic models to explore the dynamics of an ICM-like plasma (with small gyroradius, large mean-free-path, and strongly sub-dominant magnetic pressure) driven by the diffusive heat flux associated with thermal conduction. Lin- ear theory reveals that whistler waves are driven unstable electron heat flux, even when the heat flux is weak. The resonant interaction of electrons with these waves then plays a critical role in scattering electrons and suppressing the heat flux. In a 1 D model where only <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> that are parallel to the magnetic field are captured, the only resonant electrons are moving in the opposite direction to the heat flux and the electron heat flux suppression is small. In 2 D or more, oblique <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> also resonate with electrons moving {{in the direction of the}} heat flux. The overlap of resonances leads to effective symmetrization of the electron distribution function and a strong suppression of heat flux. The results suggest that thermal conduction in the ICM might be strongly suppressed, possibly to negligible levels. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures. To be published in ApJ Letter...|$|R

It is noted that the wave phase speeds before wave reflection can occur at high latitudes and that wave growth is limited to a disk-like region centered around the magnetic equator. The frequency extent of the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> noise spectrum may be estimated by the range of frequencies maximally unstable to equatorial linear growth.

40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} propagation of electromagnetic waves through a hypersonically induced plasma, it has been demonstrated that the classical radiofrequency communications blackout that is experienced during atmospheric reentry can be mitigated through the appropriate control of an external magnetic field of nominal magnitude. The model {{is based on the}} kinetic equation treatment of Vlasov and involves an analytical solution for the electric and magnetic fields within the plasma allowing for a description of the attendant transmission, reflection and absorption coefficients. The ability to transmit through the magnetized plasma is due to the magnetic windows that are created within the plasma via the well-known <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> of propagation. The case of 2 GHz transmission through a re-entry plasma is considered.

40|$|The {{influence}} of inertia on the spontaneous amplification of large-scale perturbations by electron magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) turbulence is studied in a 2 1 / 2 -dimensional(2 1 / 2 -D) model. It is shown that electron inertia {{results in the}} modification of ct-like effects, which are due to the helicity of the turbulence. Under some conditions no instability of the mean field due to helicity of turbulence will occur. Electron inertia can also change the sign of turbulent viscosity in the equation of the third component of the mean held, making it negative. The possibility is discussed of the generation of 3 -D whistlers by 2 -D EMHD turbulence due to either helicity or to anisotropy of the turbulence. Unlike the case of 2 -D large-scale perturbations, turbulent resistivity is anisotropic and leads to the destabilization of <b>whistler</b> <b>modes,</b> independently of {{the sign of the}} resistivity coefficient.

30|$|The {{slope diagram}} for the {{nonlinear}} magnetic fluctuation does not exhibit a clear {{organization in the}} beta-tilde domain, {{at least in the}} data set we used. Agreement with the quasi-static balance is poor except for the low-beta values. Various reasons are possible to explain the different result from the expected curve from the quasi-static balance. For example, not waves but shocklets are being formed in the foreshock and the correlation sense remains positive irrespective of the value of beta, or the notion of the quasi-static balance needs to be extended to include kinetic or other effects such as temperature gradients or Landau damping. Magnetosonic-type low-frequency waves in the foreshock region are typically observed or recognized as 30 -s waves, 1 -Hz waves, shocklets, and SLAMS (short large-amplitude magnetic structures) (Greenstadt et al. 1995). It is considered that the initially transverse 30 -s waves with upstream propagation in the plasma frame become compressive under a refraction process. The compressive fluctuation results into steepening and low frequency steepened magnetosonic <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> can be formed (the so-called shocklets).|$|R

The enhancement is transient and enhances the acceleration of the electrons in the sheath. A set of modified MHD equations, including those for ion inertia, quasineutrality, and electron drift, is employed to model TSS current closure. <b>Whistler</b> <b>modes</b> are found to exist and can be excited as the TSS passes through the ionosphere.

40|$|Whistler {{waves are}} present in solar wind plasma. These waves possess {{characteristic}} turbulent fluctuations that are characterized typically by the frequency and length scales that are respectively bigger than ion gyro frequency and smaller than ion gyro radius. The electron inertial length is an intrinsic length scale in whistler wave turbulence that distinguishably divides the high frequency solar wind turbulent spectra into scales smaller and bigger than the electron inertial length. We present nonlinear three dimensional, time dependent, fluid simulations of whistler wave turbulence to investigate their role in solar wind plasma. Our simulations find that the dispersive <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> evolve entirely differently in the two regimes. While the dispersive whistler wave effects are stronger in the large scale regime, they do not influence the spectral cascades which are describable by a Kolmogorov-like $k^{- 7 / 3 }$ spectrum. By contrast, the small scale turbulent fluctuations exhibit a Navier-Stokes like evolution where characteristic turbulent eddies exhibit a typical $k^{- 5 / 3 }$ hydrodynamic turbulent spectrum. By virtue of equipartition between the wave velocity and magnetic fields, we quantify the role of whistler waves in the solar wind plasma fluctuations.
