She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>mean,</b> but {{he wanted to be a}} good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [...] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do'." [...] She has written multiple songs about him. Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53. After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>mean</b> to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

Contextually, {{the purpose of the}} song has been identified as [...] "Dramatizing [...] partnership." [...] Leading up to the musical sequence, the Beast first [...] "surprises Belle by showing her his library and then they learn to eat together." [...] Author Robin O. Winter observed that [...] "During the scene they begin to see beneath their outer appearances and start to appreciate each other's inner qualities," [...] while one critic identified this as one of the scenes in [...] "which Belle and the Beast hesitantly slowly open up to one another." [...] Writing for Wesleyan University, Rachel Anne Silverman observed that [...] "Something There" [...] depicts [...] "The first time Belle and the Beast's attraction is introduced," [...] describing the couple's relationship as [...] "a passion that has developed over time." [...] Initially, Belle is alarmed [...] "as she realizes her growing love for the Beast," [...] briefly hiding behind a tree as she sings. According to the Hal Leonard Corporation and Music Theatre International, the castle's staff of enchanted objects also discover [...] "something different between Belle and the Beast." [...] "Something There" [...] concludes with Belle and the Beast retreating to a fireplace and reading. In the original film, [...] "Something There" [...] immediately precedes the film's title song. However, for its special edition re-release, the song is immediately followed by the newly reinstated [...] "Human Again".Identifying the song as [...] "where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in," [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek felt that [...] "Something There" [...] is [...] "the track with the heaviest workload." [...] The author observed that [...] "In two minutes and 19 seconds, [...] gets across just how the position and feelings of the characters have changed." [...] For instance, [...] "At the beginning of 'Something There,' Belle admits that she thought the Beast <b>was</b> <b>mean,</b> coarse, and unrefined. By the end, she’s feeling pretty smitten," [...] according to Oh My Disney. The song also depicts the film's passing of time, while providing audiences with an opportunity [...] "to appreciate Beast and first see the potential for Belle and him." [...] On the song's role in the special edition version of the film, co-director Kirk Wise explained, [...] "There's a ... little suite of music now that starts with 'Something There' ... which segues into 'Human Again' which gives the object perspective on what they hope for when [...] fall in love and that transitions into 'Beauty and the Beast' the ballad, which is the culmination of their relationship." [...] Dubbing the song [...] "soliloquies of Belle and the Beast," [...] TV Guide drew comparisons between [...] "Something There" [...] and songs from the musical South Pacific.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Brando {{appeared}} in The Young Lions, dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing. The film {{is based on}} the novel by Irwin Shaw, and Brando's portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time. He later wrote, [...] "The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about Nazism; he <b>was</b> <b>mean,</b> nasty, vicious, a cliché of evil... I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently 'bad' people in the world, but they can easily be misled." [...] Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS correspondent David Schoenbrun and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating [...] "Nobody creates a character but an actor. I play the role; now he exists. He is my creation." [...] The Young Lions also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival Montgomery Clift (although they shared no scenes together). Brando closed out the decade by appearing in The Fugitive Kind (1960) opposite Anna Magnani. The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but was hardly the success A Streetcar Named Desire had been, with the Los Angeles Times labeling Williams's personae [...] "psychologically sick or just plain ugly" [...] and The New Yorker calling it a [...] "cornpone melodrama".|$|E

2500|$|Williams began 2007 {{with renewed}} confidence, stating her {{intention}} {{to return to}} the top of the rankings, a comment 1987 Wimbledon men's singles champion and commentator Pat Cash branded [...] "deluded." [...] Williams lost in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Hobart, Australia, a warm-up for the Australian Open. Williams was unseeded at the Australian Open because of her world No. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as [...] "out of shape." [...] Williams experienced a huge amount of pressure on herself prior to the tournament, coming from her fans and the press as well as Serena herself about her weight, focus and needing a good showing. Shortly before her first match, a representative from Nike paid Williams a visit in the players' lounge, informing her that if she didn't perform to her accustomed level, the company might drop her. Williams claimed that Nike's ultimatum meant that she would have to reach the quarterfinals at least. The distraction from Nike did not distract Williams, as she lost just three games to Mara Santangelo and defeated Anne Kremer in straight sets. By this point, a blister had developed on Williamses' foot and she had contracted a cold. In the third round, Williams found herself two points away from going home against Nadia Petrova, but fought back to win in three sets, which was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. Williams then made it all the way to the final, defeating Janković, Pe'er and Vaidišová. Williams described them as [...] "good players. Strong players. Players who certainly didn't expect an overweight, out-of-shape, has been champion like me to give them a game.". Williams also found herself two points from going out against Peer before turning it around. By the time Williams had reached the final, the cold and blister had both left. Previewing the finals, Tracy Austin stated that, although Serena had a great tournament, she believed that the ride was over and that Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Serena thought it <b>was</b> <b>mean</b> and unnecessary and used it as motivation along with other criticism. In the final, Williams lost just three games against Maria Sharapova winning her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open 24 months prior. Williams became the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title whilst not being seeded, and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased half-sister Yetunde. Her performance in the final was described in the press as [...] "one of the best performances of her career" [...] and [...] "arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis." [...] In her post match interview, Williams took a swipe at her critics, stating that she had proved them wrong.|$|E
