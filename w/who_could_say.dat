500|$|Wagner {{had left}} neither a will, nor {{instruction}} on {{the management of}} the Bayreuth Festival after his death. He had written of the future: [...] "I ... cannot think of a single person <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> what I believe needs to be said ... there is practically no one on whose judgement I could rely". The festival's uncertain outlook was aggravated by Cosima's total withdrawal from all contact except that of her daughters and her friend and adviser Adolf von Groß. Without Cosima's participation the 1883 festival, as planned by Wagner—12 performances of Parsifal—went ahead, with Emil Scaria (who sang the role of Gurnemanz in the opera) doubling as artistic director. The cast was largely that of 1882, and Levi remained as conductor.|$|E
500|$|The {{aluminum}} apex, at {{the time}} a rare metal as valuable as silver, was cast by William Frishmuth of Philadelphia. At the time of casting, it was the largest piece of aluminum in the world. Before the installation it was put on public display at Tiffany's in New York City and stepped over by visitors <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> they had [...] "stepped {{over the top of the}} Washington Monument". It was [...] tall before [...] was removed from its tip by lightning strikes during 1885–1934, when it was protected from further damage by tall lightning rods surrounding it. Its base is [...] square. The angle between opposite sides at its tip is 34°48'. It weighed [...] before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides. Spectral analysis in 1934 showed that it was composed of 97.87% aluminum with the rest impurities. It has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone, which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone, and the downward protruding lip around that area prevents water from entering the joint. It has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded [...] diameter copper rod which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system.|$|E

[...] The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: [...] "Call of Cthulhu is fully deserved of the title as the most popular roleplaying system ever - it's a game that doesn't age, is eminently playable, and which hangs together perfectly. The system, even though it's over ten year's old, it {{still one of the}} very best you'll find in any roleplaying game. Also, there's not a referee in the land <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> they've read every Lovecraft inspired book or story going, so there's a pretty-well endless supply of scenario ideas. It's simply marvellous." ...|$|E

He recalls that during the recording sessions, Fintan Fitzgerald, {{in charge of the}} band's wardrobe, found a 1970s pair of wraparound blaxploitation sunglasses. Bono would put them on and make everyone laugh whenever they faced a problem or disagreement. He recalls, [...] "I became very interested in these single-line aphorisms. I had been writing them, so I got this character <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> them all, from 'A liar won't believe anybody else' to 'A friend is someone who lets you down,' and that's where 'The Fly' was coming from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spencer Sunshine {{writes that}} [...] "here were {{many things that}} drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social {{behavior}} of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust {{of the effect of}} both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman'—that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>say,</b> 'Yes' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history".|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} popular Persian poet of the 19th and early 20th centuries was Omar Khayyam (1048–1123), whose Rubaiyat was freely {{translated}} by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859.

6000|$|WORKS OF DICKENS. In {{the early}} stories of Dickens is {{a promise of}} all the rest. His first work was called Sketches by Boz, and [...] "Boz" [...] was invented by some little girl (was it in The Vicar of Wakefield?) <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> [...] "Moses"; also it was a pet name for a small brother of Dickens. There was, therefore, {{something}} childlike in this first title, and childhood was to enter very largely into the novelist's work. He could hardly finish a story without bringing a child into it; not an ordinary child, to make us smile, but a wistful or pathetic child whose sorrows, since we cannot help them, are apt to make our hearts ache.|$|R
60|$|The man fell back, daunted by his quietness, and by {{the majesty}} of his {{appearance}} in his full scarlet robes. These alarms, the continual shouting in the streets, and the growing terror lest on {{the arrival of the}} Court all the prominent magistrates should be arrested and sent to the Bastille, infinitely aggravated President Darpent's disorder. We no longer saw his son every day, for he was wholly absorbed in watching by the sick-bed, and besides there was no further need, as he averred, of his watching over us. However, Sir Francis went daily to inquire at the house, and almost always saw Clement, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> by this time speak English enough to make himself quite intelligible, but <b>who</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say</b> that, in spite of constantly being let blood, the poor old man grew weaker and weaker; and on the very day the treaty was signed he was to receive the last rites of the Church.|$|R

5000|$|Although Manton {{is little}} known now, {{in his day}} he was held in as much esteem as men like John Owen. He was {{best known for his}} skilled expository preaching, and was a {{favourite}} of John Charles Ryle, who championed his republication in the mid-19th century, and Charles Spurgeon. Of Manton, Ryle said he was [...] "a man <b>who</b> <b>could</b> neither <b>say,</b> nor do, nor write anything without being observed." [...] Spurgeon said his works contained “a mighty mountain of sound theology” and his sermons were “second to none” to his contemporaries. He went on to say, “Manton is not brilliant, but he is always clever; he is not oratorical, but he is powerful; he is not striking, but he is deep.” His finest work is probably his Exposition of James.|$|R

There was also Chawky the white faced Golliwog who would complain: [...] "Who wants a white-faced Golliwog?" [...] and Candy Floss, a [...] "Mamma Doll" [...] <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> [...] "mamma" [...] as well as Bouncy, a ball who had lost his bounce. There was also a thin Teddy Bear {{as well as a}} China Doll and a Jack in the Box. An occasional visitor to Straytown was The Toy Inspector who would check on the toys living there.|$|R
6000|$|The dollies were, he had found, {{the most}} {{delightful}} of all playthings for babies and little girls, and often those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> [...] "dolly" [...] {{would call for}} a [...] "doll" [...] in their sweet baby talk. So Claus resolved to make many dolls, of all sizes, and to dress them in bright-colored clothing. The older boys--and {{even some of the}} girls--loved the images of animals, so he still made cats and elephants and horses. And many of the little fellows had musical natures, and longed for drums and cymbals and whistles and horns. So he made a number of toy drums, with tiny sticks to beat them with; and he made whistles from the willow trees, and horns from the bog-reeds, and cymbals from bits of beaten metal.|$|R
6000|$|We {{had turned}} a neater trick on Seth Jepson than would have been {{possible}} had we gone back to our homes when the matter was first suggested, for now he might indeed give our names to the king's officers; but they would fail to find us in Boston town, and <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> when we had left? ...|$|E

6000|$|Fifteen {{years may}} seem but a short space {{of time to}} a man verging on ninety; in the mournful story of the {{extermination}} of rare and beautiful British birds for the cabinet it is in reality a long period. Fifteen years ago the honey buzzard was a breeding species in England, and had doubtless been so for thousands of years. When {{the price of a}} [...] "British-killed" [...] specimen rose to £25, and of a [...] "British-taken" [...] egg to two or three or four pounds, the bird quickly ceased to exist.
