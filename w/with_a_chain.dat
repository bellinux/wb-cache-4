5|$|Plans {{were made}} to seal off the river <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> or a boom {{stretching}} between the blockhouse and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished {{at a cost of}} £305. Further work was carried out on the defences, possibly including raising earthworks and establishing watch-houses. Fears of an invasion persisted for many years afterwards and in 1598 Charles Howard, the Lord High Admiral, expressed his concerns about the effectiveness of the Gravesend Blockhouse in protecting the Thames.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{pay-per-view}} began, Shane Douglas defeated Buddy Rose {{in a dark}} match. Hercules attacked Shawn Michaels {{prior to}} the first televised bout, hitting him in the knee <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain.</b> Although his partner was unable to compete, Jannetty controlled {{the beginning of the}} match, using hip tosses to throw Roma and Hercules. Power and Glory then attacked Jannetty while their manager, Slick, distracted the referee. Although Jannetty was able to mount a brief comeback, Roma and Hercules wore him down and got the victory after performing a PowerPlex—a superplex from Hercules followed by a diving splash from Roma.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the event was a Hell in a Cell bout between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Triple H choked Batista <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> and {{hit him in the}} back with a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire. Batista regained the {{momentum}} by grabbing Triple H's sledgehammer and hitting him with it. Batista performed a spinebuster onto the steel steps on Triple H, which was followed with a Batista Bomb for the win to retain the title. After the Hell in a Cell match, Triple H was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E

5|$|The fortalice, {{or small}} fort, {{took the form}} of an {{enclosure}} castle, with a curtain wall protected by mural towers and a gate tower. It was constructed on land in the manor of Stoke Fleming, belonging to the Carew family, lent by them due to the threat of French attack, and was built around a pre-existing chapel to Saint Petroc on the site. It held catapults to attack enemy ships, and may also have been armed with early cannon and equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> to block the entrance to the harbour. It did not see active service, but may have deterred the original plans of the French and Breton attack force in 1404, which, under the command of Tanneguy du Chastel, landed at Slapton Sands instead, where they were then dispersed by the local militia. The Carew family subsequently built a family house in an inside corner of the fortalice.|$|E
5|$|Another {{featured}} bout on the undercard pitted Kurt Angle against John Cena. On the September 18 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Angle lost an Iron Man match to Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship. The match marked {{the third time}} that Angle defended the title against Lesnar with the first being WrestleMania XIX where Lesnar won the title and the second being SummerSlam which Angle retained. The next week on SmackDown, Angle tried to call Lesnar out to the ring, demanding a rematch, but instead Cena came to the ring and attacked Angle. On the October 2 episode of SmackDown, two of the primary rivalries on SmackDown intertwined in a tag team match, where Lesnar and Cena faced the team of Angle and the Undertaker, which Cena and Lesnar won after Cena struck Angle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain.</b> The next week on SmackDown, a rap battle took place between Cena and Angle, in which both men performed raps insulting each other. The battle ended with Angle attacking Cena and the two proceeding {{to fight in the}} ring.|$|E
