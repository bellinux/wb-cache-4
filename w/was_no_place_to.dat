5|$|The Comos' first child, Ronnie, {{was born}} in 1940 while the Weems band was working in Chicago. Como left the {{performance}} to be at his wife's side {{even though he was}} threatened with dismissal if he did so. Though Perry was now making $250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem, young Ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were able to stay in one place for a period of time. The radio program Beat the Band did not always originate from Chicago, but was often done from locations such as Milwaukee, Denver and St. Louis, as the band continued to play road engagements while part of the radio show cast. The Comos decided road life <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> try raising a child, and Roselle and the baby went back to Canonsburg.|$|E

Warren denied Sheridan's allegation that Warren had given the impression he wanted the sun to go down before the attack could be made and that there were 2.5 hours of daylight still left at 4:00p.m.|$|E

25|$|The pig cull {{negatively}} affected the Zabbaleen in several ways. First, because the pigs eat the organic waste, {{they are a}} vital component in their recycling system, the pig cull literally destroyed the Zabbaleen recycling system. Deprived of their pig herds, the Zabbaleen stopped collecting such organic trash, leaving food piles to rot in the streets, leading to the increase of trash in the streets. According to Engi Wassef, recycling and sorting activities in the Zabbaleen villages all but ceased after the pig cull, because without the pigs, the sorting and recycling activities of the Zabbaleen became economically unfeasible. Less trash was brought into the village, because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put the trash. Hence, the entire recycling system was broken, placing the Zabbaleen out of work.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, {{amidst a}} {{flowering}} of affection for Heine {{leading up to}} the centennial of his birth, plans were made to honor Heine with a memorial; these were strongly supported by one of Heine's greatest admirers, Elisabeth of Bavaria, Empress of Austria. The empress commissioned a statue from the sculptor Louis Hasselriis. Another memorial, a sculpted fountain, was commissioned for Düsseldorf. While at first the plan met with enthusiasm, the concept was gradually bogged down in anti-Semitic, nationalist, and religious criticism; by the time the fountain was finished, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put it. Through the intervention of German American activists, the memorial was ultimately transplanted into the Bronx, New York City (in Philadelphia already in 1855 were printed the complete edition of Heine's works in German language.). While the memorial is known in English as the Lorelei Fountain, Germans refer to it as the Heinrich Heine Memorial. Also, after years of controversy, the University of Düsseldorf was named Heinrich Heine University. Today the city honours its poet with a boulevard (Heinrich-Heine-Allee) and a modern monument. A Heine statue, originally located near Empress Elisabeth's palace in Corfu, was later rejected by Hamburg, but eventually found a home in Toulon.|$|E
25|$|Around 1770, a {{small group}} {{consisting}} of Spanish explorers decided that the Cosumnes River Preserve and other places within the Central Valley was a perfect pasture for grazing animals. Trappers came into {{the area around the}} preserve in the early 1800s but found that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> settle and the fur trapping was not worth it. The Mexican government started issuing land grants in 1844 and John Sutter who was a European immigrant {{was one of the first}} to colonize the Cosumnes River area. John Sutter founded the colony New Helvetia and soon some of his assistants moved out to the Cosumnes River Preserve area. Once the California gold rush started in 1848, many miners settled in along the Cosumnes River hoping to find gold and get rich. Once realizing that there wasn't very much gold in the region, they dammed the river and changed the landscape to grow hay, wheat, and various types of fruit. The Miwok people lost sources of food that they relied on and soon after villages and burial grounds were destroyed. Shortly after, the Miwok moved out of the region where the Cosumnes River Preserve is and in 1999, the last person to spoke Plains Miwuk died.|$|E

500|$|With the {{deterioration}} of the fourth span, the bridge commission and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation started construction on a $9.38 million (2007 USD ($ in [...] )) concrete bridge with steel beams connecting Traffic Route 434 on the Pennsylvania side (assigned in 1967) and Touring Route 55/Sullivan County Route 11 (assigned in 1930). The construction began on February 2004, and since there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> perform a groundbreaking ceremony, the construction company hired, Fahs Construction Group of Binghamton, New York performed a [...] "bridge-breaking" [...] ceremony on March 25, 2004, taking sledgehammers to the bridge. The bridge was expected to have resemble the Roebling Aqueduct, which lay to the north in Minisink Ford, New York. The bridge was proposed to be [...] with twin [...] travel lanes and an [...] shoulder. It was to also have three balconies facing upstream of the Delaware River, to offer travelers scenic views.|$|E

2500|$|Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened as Norway's main {{international}} gateway on 1 June 1939. Fornebu was located [...] {{from the city}} center of Oslo, on the peninsula of Fornebu. The cramped location made a suitable runway for intercontinental flights impossible to build and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> build a second runway. A 1970 report proposed building a new airport to serve the capital and Eastern Norway, and mentioned Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and Ås as suitable locations. Later Hobøl was also proposed. Various discussions were made for a new airport, and from 1972 all charter flights were moved to Gardermoen. The divided solution was accepted by Parliament, and approved a major expansion of Fornebu in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Post {{described}} Queens, New York, as [...] "basically forgotten" [...] on January25 as roads remained {{covered with}} snow.

Crews expressed that certain areas, such as in the Bronx, were difficult to navigate with snow plows and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put the snow. A resident of Pelham Bay stated that 3-1-1 operators were not picking up calls. Mayor De Blasio toured areas of Staten Island on January24 and urged people to be patient. In contrast, both Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio were praised for their handling of the storm prior to its arrival, and for being the first to issue a travel ban, which is credited for potentially saving lives.|$|E

2500|$|Pucci used {{a series}} of {{nautical}} themes for crew uniforms. For the hostesses, Pucci used [...] "space age" [...] themes, including plastic Space Helmets and Bolas (as dubbed by Pucci). These clear plastic bubbles, which resembled Captain Video helmets and which Braniff termed [...] "RainDome", were to be worn between the terminal and the plane to prevent hairstyles from being disturbed by outside elements. [...] "RainDomes" [...] were dropped after about a month because the helmets cracked easily, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> store them on the aircraft, and jetways at many airports made them unnecessary. For the footwear, Beth Levine created plastic boots and designed two-tone calfskin boots and shoes. Later uniforms and accessories were composed of interchangeable parts, which could be removed and added as needed.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the third}} day, the {{controversy}} restarted. At {{the end of}} the 116th over of India's first innings, Harbhajan was batting with Tendulkar in a vital partnership for India, who had just lost a series of quick wickets. Lee was the bowler in that over and Harbhajan had just edged him over the slips for four. Harbhajan then tapped Lee on the backside with his bat, apparently saying [...] "hard luck", to which Lee did not react. Symonds says he needed to stand up for Lee so in his own words, he [...] "had a bit of a crack at Harbhajan, telling him exactly what I thought of his antics". Symonds went on to claim that Harbhajan then [...] "shot back" [...] by calling him a monkey. Symonds stated in the appeal hearing that he believed that Test cricket <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be friendly to opposition players, so he spoke to Harbhajan. Under questioning he admitted that he had provoked the incident and used the word [...] "fuck" [...] among other language against Harbhajan, who stated that he then became [...] "very angry" [...] because of the use of this word.|$|E
2500|$|The impasse {{was broken}} by a third party. [...] During World War I, an office {{building}} named the Munitions Building {{was built on the}} north side of the National Mall between 19th and 21st Streets NW. [...] Designed to be temporary, it had never been torn down. [...] A second, nearly identical temporary building, the Main Navy Building, was constructed east of it in 1941. Attempts to have the [...] "tempos" [...] demolished were made over the years, but these efforts had little effect. [...] In March 1954, however, legislation was introduced in Congress to fund the demolition. But there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> house the displaced defense workers. [...] Attention turned to the General Services Administration (GSA), the federal agency which owns most U.S. government buildings. [...] GSA worried that spending federal funds for construction immediately would worsen inflation (which was running high at the time). [...] The agency said it preferred to purchase land and pay for the construction of new federal buildings to house these workers through the use of federal [...] "lease-purchase" [...] legislation. This World War II-era statute allowed the GSA to lease land and permit a private developer to construct a building. [...] GSA would provide financial guarantees to enable the developer to obtain financing for the building's construction, as well as agree to a long-term lease of the structure. [...] Lease-purchase gave GSA the option of buying the land and building at the end of 20 or 30 years, with its lease payments being put toward the cost of the structure. [...] Although the lease-purchase legislation did not specifically include the District, GSA thought it could be interpreted that way.|$|E
