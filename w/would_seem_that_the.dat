5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E

25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this sudden change in the {{relationship}} with the Chola kingdom is not really known. However, as some historians suggest, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Khmer king, Suryavarman I of the Khmer Empire, had requested aid from Emperor Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty against Tambralinga. After learning of Suryavarman's alliance with Rajendra Chola, the Tambralinga kingdom requested aid from the Srivijaya king, Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. This eventually led to the Chola Empire coming into conflict with the Srivijiya Empire. The conflict ended with a victory for the Chola and heavy losses for Srivijaya and the capture of Sangramavijayottungavarman in the Chola raid in 1025 CE. During the reign of Kulothunga Chola I, Srivijaya had sent an embassy to the Chola Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Tacitus, the Aestii have emerged. The former Scythia is now entirely Sarmatia. Evidently the Sarmatians have conquered westward to the Vistula. The Goths have moved to the south. That the Balts lived east of the Vistula from remote prehistoric times is unquestioned. The Baltic languages, however, are only known from the 2nd {{millennium}} AD. They {{are known to have}} developed in tribal contexts, as they were originally tribal. The first mention of any tribes is in Ptolemy's description of European Sarmatia, where the main Prussian tribes are mentioned for the first time. In Tacitus, only the language of the Aestii is mentioned. Strabo distinguishes the Venedi, who were likely Slavs. From these few references, which are the only surviving evidence apart from glottochronology and place name analysis, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Balts of Pytheas' time were well past the Common Balto-Slavic stage, and likely spoke a number of related dialects. By turning back at what he thought was the limit of Germany, he not only missed the Balts, but did not discover that more Germans, the Goths, had moved into the Baltic area.|$|E

500|$|Thus, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal was {{the last}} major attempt by the Japanese to seize control of the seas around Guadalcanal or to retake the island. In contrast, the U.S. Navy was {{thereafter}} able to resupply the U.S. forces at Guadalcanal at will, including the delivery of two fresh divisions by late December 1942. The inability to neutralize Henderson Field doomed the Japanese effort to successfully combat the Allied conquest of Guadalcanal. The last Japanese resistance in the Guadalcanal campaign ended on 9 February 1943, with the successful evacuation {{of most of the}} surviving Japanese troops from the island by the Japanese Navy in Operation Ke. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, which culminated in Japan's defeat and the end of World War II. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, upon learning {{of the results of the}} battle, commented, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> turning point in this war has at last been reached." ...|$|E
500|$|Russell then {{inquires}} {{into the}} power that reason has over a community, as contrasted with fanaticism. It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> power of reason {{is that it is}} able to increase the odds of success in practical matters by way of technical efficiency. The cost of allowing for reasoned inquiry is the tolerance of intellectual disagreement, which in turn provokes scepticism and dims the power of fanaticism. Conversely, it would seem that a community is stronger and more cohesive if there is widespread agreement within it over certain creeds, and reasoned debate is rare. If these two opposing conditions are both to be fully exploited for short-term gains, then it would demand two things: first, that some creed be held both by the majority opinion (through force and propaganda), and second, that the majority of intellectual class concurs (through reasoned discussion). In the long-term, however, creeds tend to provoke weariness, light scepticism, outright disbelief, and finally, apathy. (Russell 1938:123–125) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "All About That Bass" [...] became {{a subject of}} {{controversy}} among several music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. The singer was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song, namely in the lyrics [...] "bringing booty back / Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that," [...] and [...] "Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your size / She says, 'Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.'" [...] The former lyric was however developed by Kadish and not Trainor. In a publication by The Daily Telegraph, Olivia O'Niell analyzed, [...] "If the song's 908,000 likes on YouTube and Meghan's 90,000 followers on Twitter are anything to go by, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> message most people are taking away from the hit is a positive one".

2500|$|The {{presence}} of the warrah, Dusicyon australis, has often been cited as evidence of pre-European occupation of the islands.

[...] It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lineages of the maned wolf and the Falkland Islands wolf separated in North America; canids did not appear in South America until roughly 3 million {{years ago in a}} paleozoogeographical event called the Great American Biotic Interchange, in which the continents of North and South America were newly connected by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.

2500|$|The Basilica is {{sometimes}} referred to as Our Lady of the Snows, a name given to it in the Roman Missal from 1568 to 1969 in connection with the liturgical feast of the anniversary of its dedication on 5 August, a feast that was then denominated Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Nives (Dedication of Saint Mary of the Snows). This name for the basilica had become popular in the 14th century in connection with a legend that the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia reports thus: [...] "During the pontificate of Liberius, the Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to them how they were to dispose of their property in her honour. On 5 August, {{at the height of the}} Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary which they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honour of Mary on the very spot which was covered with snow. From the fact that no mention whatever is made of this alleged miracle until a few hundred years later, not even by Sixtus III in his eight-line dedicatory inscription ... it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legend has no historical basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Harris Sagaser sets Sonnet 29 {{apart from}} other Elizabethan sonnets in that the speaker is the main focus, as opposed to many love sonnets of the time focused entirely on {{the object of the}} speaker's affection, or so of the poet's desire; this <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poem is about the woman, not the speaker. However, Sasager says, [...] "I do not mean to imply that... (these poems) are {{themselves}} 'about' particular beloveds. But they do pretend to be, and therein is the difference. She goes on to clarify this difference, or what sets sonnet 29 apart from most love object-centered sonnets of the time. [...] "The poet-lover in sonnet 29 admits up front that the fruits of his inward experience are primarily his own, though not his own in terms of everafter fame... Instead, the speaker of 29 is concerned first to wonder" [...] This is to say that though most poetry of the time was at least disguised to be about the object of the speaker's affection, this sonnet does not even attempt to do so. According to Sasager, it is clear that this poem is speaker-focused and about the emotions and experiences of the speaker, not that of the beloved. As discussed by other critics, Sasager addresses the lack of [...] "when... then" [...] structure saying [...] "the poem shifts to representing a particular moment: not a past moment, but now." [...] She makes a point to say this differs notably from other poems of the time.|$|E
