2500|$|Voigt {{announced}} {{ahead of}} the 2014 USA Pro Cycling Challenge that the race {{would be his last}} as a professional. He almost won Stage 4 in that last race thanks to a day-long breakaway. He was joined by the raging peloton with only 900 meters to go. Before the last stage of the race, Voigt was asked in an interview with Outside Magazine: Americans also like your panache, the fact that you’re willing {{to go out on a}} break all day and attack. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> trait? to which he answered: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{little piece}} of vanity! {{studying}} yourself in the glass, so that you never heard me come in? Well, you have done it to some purpose. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> thing?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come again!' she cried. 'Well, I really shall {{begin to}} think that angels and ministers of grace exist off the stage! You pretty thing! Let me look at you. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> delicious little bonnet?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There haven't {{been any}} horses {{for over a}} hundred years." [...] The man came toward Cole. [...] "Who are you? Why are you dressed up like that? <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> vehicle and pair of horses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is indeed--delightfully. And <b>where</b> <b>DO</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> your ways {{of saying}} things? It isn't anything--and the things aren't anything. But it's so droll." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hello, Lewston," [...] cried Harry, {{running as}} near as he could go without getting his shoes wet, for the water ran up quite a {{distance}} among the trees in some places.

6000|$|... "Jack Owlet! Oh my! Hoo! hoo!" [...] exclaimed the {{blacking}} boy, {{as soon as}} Lavinia {{had disappeared}} up the stairs, dancing about with {{his hands on his}} hips.

6000|$|... 'I assure your Grace,' said Mr. Annesley, {{speaking}} slowly, 'that {{that story}} about Lady de Courcy is quite untrue and very rude. I never {{turn my back}} on any woman; only my heel. We are on the best possible terms. She is never to speak to me, and I am always to bow to her. But I really must purchase. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> glass-chain, St. James? Lady Afy, can you accommodate me?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In some people," [...] the Baroness declared. [...] "Not in all." [...] Charlotte {{was walking}} beside her; she {{took hold of}} her hand again, smiling always. [...] "And you, cousine, <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> enchanting complexion?" [...] she went on; [...] "such lilies and roses?" [...] The roses in poor Charlotte's countenance began speedily to predominate over the lilies, and she quickened her step and reached the portico. [...] "This is the country of complexions," [...] the Baroness continued, {{addressing}} herself to Mr. Wentworth. [...] "I am convinced they are more delicate. There are very good ones in England--in Holland; {{but they are very}} apt to be coarse. There is too much red." ...|$|E
6000|$|One day, however, as he {{was lying}} half asleep in the warm water somewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all over, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven {{thousand}} miles away, the games his companions played, {{the smell of the}} seaweed, the seal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he turned north, swimming steadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for the same place, and they said: [...] "Greeting, Kotick! This year we are all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off Lukannon and play on the new grass. But <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> coat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance {{with the}} {{yearling}} seals. The sea {{is full of}} fire on summer nights {{all the way down}} from Novastoshnah to Lukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a flaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent streaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds and rolled {{up and down in the}} new wild wheat and told stories of what they had done while they had been at sea. They talked about the Pacific as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart of that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie romped down from Hutchinson's Hill crying: [...] "Out of the way, youngsters! The sea is deep and you don't know all that's in it yet. Wait till you've rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> white coat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{sent for}} the fisherman. [...] "Fisherman," [...] he said, [...] "the fish you have brought us have caused me some anxiety. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> them from?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John"--and {{there was}} just a touch of {{severity}} in her voice--"when your mother asks you a question you should answer that particular question. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With disapproval. Who {{are those}} Puritans {{you are talking}} about? But wait--how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come to {{know so much about}} this family? <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all this hearsay evidence?" ...|$|R
