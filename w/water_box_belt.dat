As the TMT is the finish product thus proper control of rolling parameters and <b>water</b> <b>box</b> is needed to achieve adequate property. <b>Water</b> <b>box</b> {{plays an important role}} for achieving the final structure and property of the rebars. <b>Water</b> <b>box</b> is responsible for outer rim formation and which helps to achieve the yield strength of the material. The present paper highlights failure investigation of a failed rebar during bending operations. From fractography and microstructural analysis it is confirmed that the rebar sample failed in brittle manner due to through harden martensitic structure and which indicates that there is some anomaly in <b>water</b> <b>box</b> resulting in these premature failures...|$|R

First, the three-dimensional mold temperatures are calculated using shell-mold heat flux and cooling water profiles that have been calibrated with plant measurements at Tata Steel IJmuiden. Next, the thermal stresses and distorted shape of the mold are calculated with a detailed finite-element model of a symmetric fourth of the entire mold and <b>water</b> <b>box</b> assembly, and are validated with plant measurements of the wear of the narrow face copper mold plates.

40|$|Design {{methods for}} full face gaskets in bolted {{pressure}} vessel joints have received little {{attention in the}} literature. Such gasketed joints play {{a prominent role in}} at-taching rectangular plan from <b>water</b> <b>boxes</b> to rectangular tubesheets in condenser <b>water</b> <b>boxes.</b> With higher cooling water pressures becoming evident due to cooling tower circuits, the water box-tubesheet structure, and its bolted joint connection requires rigorous analysis for both structural integrity and leak tightness. Although {{it is well known that}} gasket material has a highly nonlinear stress strain behavior, very few analyses are available to calculate and evaluate the effect of the nonlinear gasket behavior in a bolted joint connection. In this paper, an approximate method for simultaneously analyzing structural integrity and leak tightness of typical bolted flange connections with nonlinear gasket material is developed. The flange is modeled as an elastic element, the bolt is simulated by a linear spring with bending and extensional resistance, and the gasket is modeled by a series of nonlinear compression springs. A simple nonlinear stress-strain relation for initial loading and unloading of the gasket is developed based on experimental data. The analysi...|$|R

50|$|The notorious RBMK {{graphite}} moderated, water-cooled reactors of Chernobyl Power Plant disaster {{were designed}} {{with a positive}} void coefficient with boron control rods on electromagnetic grapples for reaction speed control. To the degree that the control systems were reliable, this design did have a corresponding degree of active inherent safety. The reactor was unsafe at low power levels because erroneous control rod movement would have a counter-intuitively magnified effect. Chernobyl Reactor 4 was built instead with manual crane driven boron control rods that were tipped with the moderator substance, graphite, a neutron reflector. It was designed with an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) that depended on either grid power or the backup Diesel generator to be operating. The ECCS safety component was decidedly not passive. The design featured a partial containment consisting of a concrete slab {{above and below the}} reactor - with pipes and rods penetrating, an inert gas filled metal vessel to keep oxygen away from the water-cooled hot graphite, a fire-proof roof, and the pipes below the vessel sealed in secondary <b>water</b> filled <b>boxes.</b> The roof, metal vessel, concrete slabs and <b>water</b> <b>boxes</b> are examples of passive safety components. The roof in the Chernobyl Power Plant complex was made of bitumen - against design - rendering it ignitable. Unlike the Three Mile Island accident, neither the concrete slabs nor the metal vessel could contain a steam, graphite and oxygen driven hydrogen explosion. The <b>water</b> <b>boxes</b> could not sustain high pressure failure of the pipes. The passive safety components as designed were inadequate to fulfill the safety requirements of the system.|$|R
