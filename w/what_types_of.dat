These included moral issues, matrimonial issues, disputes about wills and testaments, the correction of sins, and slander and physical {{attacks on the}} clergy.|$|E
5|$|In January 1985, Collins renewed her {{push for}} {{additional}} education funding and changes by appointing herself {{secretary of the}} state Education and Humanities Cabinet. Following the announcement, Collins and several key legislators {{held a series of}} meetings in every county, advocating for her proposed changes and seeking information about <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> changes the state's citizens desired. At the meetings, Collins was careful to separate the issues of her proposed education plan and potential tax increases. She believed that opposition to increased taxes had prevented her previous package from being enacted.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E

5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry {{addressed}} a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates {{other than those}} normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining {{those who did not}} attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> cases and the type of procedure {{that could be used in}} what type of case.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{different}} specialized combat roles equivalent to standard character classes. They are Battlers (warriors), Dark (dark knights), Gunners, Kanbus (ninja), Koas (paladins), and Somas (mages). A character's class determines <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> weapons and skills they can equip. Each class consequently uses a different fighting style: the Kanbus focuses on dual weapons and one-hit attacks, the Koas {{focuses on a}} combination of attack and healing abilities, the Dark sacrifices health to deal heavier damage, Gunners specialize in long-range attacks, Battlers focuses on melee attacks, and the Somas use long-range magic over close-range physical attacks. Weapons are equipped based on a character's class, and can be upgraded using special items called Orbs. Weapons and items collected through exploration and from enemy drops can be sold to other players through wireless connection.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{publishers}} of erotic romance are either small press publishers or electronic book publishers.

The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books. Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, ABC {{completed}} its transition to color; the decade {{as a whole}} would mark {{a turning point for}} ABC, as it began to pass CBS and NBC in the ratings to become the first place network. It also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences. ABC's gains in audience share were greatly helped by the fact that several smaller markets had grown large enough to allow full-time affiliations from all three networks.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-fourteenth century, {{there were}} {{restrictions}} placed on London surgeons as to <b>what</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> injuries {{they were able}} to treat and the types of medications that they could prescribe or use, because surgery was still looked at as an incredibly dangerous procedure that should only be used appropriately. Some of the wounds that were allowed to be performed on were external injuries, such as skin lesions caused by a sharp edge, such as by a sword, dagger and axe or through household tools such as knives. During this time, it was also expected that the surgeons were extremely knowledgeable on human anatomy and would be held accountable for any consequences {{as a result of the}} procedure.|$|E

About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
