Several deaths {{have been linked}} to the toxic dust, and the victims' names were included in the World Trade Center memorial. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses {{as a result of the}} toxic dust. There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 1940, he saw Marianne and Gil {{off with}} their {{chattels}} {{on a train}} to Toulouse, where his sister Guiliana lived with her husband, Duccio Tabet. On 13 June, just a day before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse. Luria went to Marseilles, from whence he eventually {{made his way to}} the United States. Pontecorvo, Marianna, Gil, Guiliana and Tabet boarded a train that took them to Lisbon via Madrid on 19 July 1940. Both women <b>were</b> <b>pregnant.</b> Marianne had a miscarriage, and was hardly fit to travel, but nonetheless boarded the liner Quanza on 9 August 1940 on its voyage bringing refugees to the United States. Both women were seasick. On 19 August 1940, the ship reached New York City, where they stayed with his brother Paolo. While there, he visited Fermi at his new home in Leonia, New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|Those who {{supported}} the ritual, did however, put restrictions on sati. It was considered wrong for women who had young children to care for, those who <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> or menstruating. A woman who had doubts or {{did not wish to}} commit sati at the last moment, could be removed from the pyre by a man, usually a brother of the deceased or someone from her husband's side of the family.|$|E

25|$|Paul Durousseau (born August 11, 1970) is an American {{serial killer}} who murdered seven young women (including two who <b>were</b> <b>pregnant)</b> in the {{southeast}} United States between 1997 and 2003. German authorities suspect he may have killed several local women when he was stationed there with the U.S. Army during the early 1990s. Typically, Durousseau would gain the victim's trust, enter the victim's home, tie their hands, rape, then strangle them to death. All of his known victims were young, single African-American women.|$|E
25|$|In 1021, when Min Saw {{was about}} six years old, his father was deposed by his step-brothers Kyiso and Sokkate.

25|$|Over {{ninety percent}} of English women (and adults, in general) entered {{marriage}} in this era at {{an average age of}} about 25–26 years for the bride and 27–28 years for the groom. Among the nobility and gentry, the average was around 19-21 for brides and 24-26 for grooms. Many city and townswomen married {{for the first time in}} their thirties and forties and it was not unusual for orphaned young women to delay marriage until the late twenties or early thirties to help support their younger siblings, and roughly a fourth of all English brides <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> at their weddings.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, {{to see that the}} fetus is well-positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not want people to know they <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E

25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred {{once or twice a}} month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.|$|E

500|$|With a forearm {{length of}} , M.griveaudi {{is a small}} Miniopterus. It is usually dark brown, but {{sometimes}} reddish. The tragus (a projection inside the ear) is narrow and ends in a rounded tip. The uropatagium (tail membrane) appears virtually naked. In the skull, the palate is concave and the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The species occurs up to [...] above sea level on Madagascar, often in karstic areas. In the Comoros, it reaches [...] and roosts in lava tubes as well as shallower caves. Females collected on Grande Comore in November <b>were</b> <b>pregnant,</b> but data on reproduction is limited and suggests individual and inter-island variation.|$|E
500|$|Like Temple Sinai's {{previous}} rabbis, Broude passionately supported liberal causes, opposing U.S. {{involvement in}} the Vietnam War, and taking part in marches during the Civil Rights Movement. Although he was a Reform rabbi, {{he had gone to}} an Orthodox yeshiva as a boy, and religiously he was in many ways more traditional than his predecessors. He re-introduced ritual into the synagogue, but more contentiously opposed intermarriage. His immediate predecessor, Stern, had officiated at intermarriages [...] "under certain conditions". Broude initially did so as well, under [...] "extenuating circumstances" [...] (e.g. if the bride <b>were</b> <b>pregnant).</b> His position later hardened, and he refused to perform such marriages under any circumstances. He even refused to allow other rabbis who would be willing to do so officiate at intermarriages at Temple Sinai. The issue eventually came to a congregational vote in 1972, which supported Broude, although the debate was never completely settled.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1948, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) was {{established}} in accordance with a presidential directive from Truman to the National Academy of Sciences – National Research Council to conduct investigations of the late effects of radiation among the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One of the early studies conducted by the ABCC was {{on the outcome of}} pregnancies occurring in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in a control city, Kure, located [...] south of Hiroshima, in order to discern the conditions and outcomes related to radiation exposure. Dr. James V. Neel led the study which found that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher among the children of survivors who <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> {{at the time of the}} bombings. Neel also studied the longevity of the children who survived the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reporting that between 90 and 95 percent were still living 50 years later.|$|E
500|$|Nine men {{in teams}} of three would {{undertake}} the sledging work. The first stage, hauling {{over the sea}} ice to Hut Point, started on 1 September 1915, and was completed without mishap {{by the end of}} the month. [...] The second stage, hauling back and forth between Hut Point and the Bluff, proved more problematic, with unfavourable weather, a difficult Barrier surface, and more dissension between Mackintosh and Joyce over methods. [...] This time, Mackintosh favoured man-hauling while Joyce wanted to use the four fit dogs—of the six dogs that had survived the winter, two <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> and could not work. Mackintosh allowed Joyce to proceed in his own way, leading a party of six with the dogs, while Mackintosh [...] continued to man-haul with Wild and Spencer-Smith. Joyce's methods proved the more effective in terms of loads carried and the fitness of the men. The base depot at Minna Bluff was completed by 28 December.|$|E
500|$|Miniopterus griveaudi {{is known}} from [...] {{altitude}} on Grande Comore and [...] on Anjouan. In the Comoros, it roosts in caves, both lava tubes and shallower structures; {{it was found}} to share one cave on Grande Comore with another bat, Rousettus obliviosus. Individuals of M.griveaudi {{have been found to}} leave a Grande Comore cave at sunset. Flying M.griveaudi have mostly been recorded in forests, but this may reflect a lack of survey effort in open areas. In caves, individuals either group in large groups of more than 50 bats without reproductive activity or in smaller groups of at most five reproductively active bats. Limited data on reproduction show some notable variation between individuals and islands. In two caves surveyed on Grande Comore in November 2006, all females <b>were</b> <b>pregnant</b> with single embryos with crown-rump lengths of , but none of the males were reproductively active. In another cave, none of the bats examined at the same time—all males—were reproductively active. None of the bats captured in one of the caves in April 2007 showed signs of reproductive activity. On Anjouan, no bats were reproductively active in two caves surveyed in late November 2006.|$|E
