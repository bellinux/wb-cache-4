5|$|Kiger Mustangs {{are most}} often dun in color, {{although}} they are found in other solid colors. Compact and <b>well-muscled</b> in appearance, their coloration and phenotype make them {{some of the most}} desired by private buyers when horses are removed from the feral herds. The BLM rounds up the horses from the two herd management areas every three to four years, and auctions excess horses to the public, returning horses to public lands that meet the desired coloration and phenotype and sometimes exchanging horses between the two herds to maintain genetic diversity. Horses in private ownership may be registered in several breed associations, the largest and oldest being the Kiger Meste√±o Association, established in 1988.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian {{horse is}} a horse breed from Canada. It is a strong, <b>well-muscled</b> breed of horse, usually dark in colour. The horses are {{generally}} used for riding and driving. Descended from draft and light riding horses imported to Canada {{in the late}} 1600s, it was later crossed with other British and American breeds. During the 18th century the Canadian horse spread throughout the northeastern US, where it contributed {{to the development of}} several horse breeds. During the peak popularity of the breed, three subtypes could be distinguished, a draft horse type, a trotting type and a pacing type. Thousands of horses were exported in the 19th century, many of whom were subsequently killed while acting as cavalry horses in the American Civil War. These exports decreased the purebred Canadian population {{almost to the point of}} extinction, prompting the formation of a studbook and the passage of a law against further export.|$|E
5|$|The Haflinger, {{also known}} as the Avelignese, is a breed of horse {{developed}} in Austria and northern Italy (namely Hafling in South Tyrol region) during the late nineteenth century. Haflinger horses are relatively small, are always chestnut in color, have distinctive gaits described as energetic but smooth, and are <b>well-muscled</b> yet elegant. The breed traces its ancestry to the Middle Ages; there are several theories for its origin. Haflingers, developed for use in mountainous terrain, are known for their hardiness. Their current conformation and appearance are the result of infusions of bloodlines from Arabian and various European breeds into the original native Tyrolean ponies. The foundation sire, 249 Folie, was born in 1874; by 1904 the first breeders' cooperative was formed. All Haflingers can trace their lineage back to Folie through one of seven bloodlines. World Wars I and II, as well as the Great Depression, had a detrimental effect on the breed, and lower-quality animals were used at times to save the breed from extinction. During World War II, breeders focused on horses that were shorter and more draft-like, favored by the military for use as packhorses. The emphasis after the war shifted toward animals of increased refinement and height.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulders}} of a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog are long, sloping, strong, moderately laid back, flat and <b>well-muscled.</b> Their forelegs are straight and strong.|$|E
25|$|The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a {{draft and}} drover breed; it is a large, heavy-boned dog with {{incredible}} physical strength. Despite being heavy-boned and <b>well-muscled,</b> {{the dog is}} agile enough to perform the all-purpose farm duties of the mountainous regions of its origin.|$|E
25|$|The Spinone has {{a square}} build (the {{length of the}} body is {{approximately}} equal to the height at the withers). It is a strong-boned, solidly built dog with a <b>well-muscled</b> body and limbs that are suited to almost any kind of terrain. A brown and white Spinone can sometimes be confused with a German Wirehaired Pointer by someone unfamiliar with the breeds. However, the long head and pronounced occipital are unique to the breed. He has an expression that shows intelligence and understanding and is often described as having human-like eyes. The tail of the working Spinone is customarily docked at half its length (approx 5.5 to 8inches or 140 to 200mm {{from the base of the}} tail). Non-working UK based Italian Spinones are no longer docked, in accordance with current legislation. Even as adults, Spinoni retain disproportionate, puppy-like, webbed paws which make them powerful swimmers.|$|E
500|$|The Dales pony is ideally [...] The head is straight, neat, {{and broad}} between the eyes, {{with a fine}} muzzle and incurving ears. [...] The body is fairly short in the back, with a broad and deep rib cage, long, broad and <b>well-muscled</b> quarters, a <b>well-muscled</b> neck of [...] a good length joining neatly into strong withers and strong sloping shoulders. [...] The legs are very muscular, with hard, dense bone, clearly defined tendons, {{flexible}} pasterns, and large round hooves with open heels. [...] The mane, tail and leg feathers are straight, silky and abundant.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{has a large}} head, {{slightly}} convex profile, and a long, <b>well-muscled</b> neck. The withers are <b>well-muscled,</b> {{which often}} makes them less pronounced, the chest is broad and deep, the shoulders are muscular and sloping, and the croup slightly sloping. The legs are short {{in relation to the}} body, but strong and <b>well-muscled.</b> The legs have little or no feather, as the breed was developed partially for working in the heavy clay soils of its native country, where heavy feather led to increased disease prevalence. They are hardy and long-lived horses, and docile in temperament. In the early 20th century, when a breed standard was issued by the British Cleveland Bay Society for use in judging shows, a section was added on the movement of the horses, describing the desired action, especially at the trot. [...] This was included in part because military potential was still considered a factor in evaluating harness horses and a good trot was necessary for an artillery horse. It was also evaluated because breeds with large action at the trot often also have a potential for jumping. The combination of desired characteristics means that the breed is useful for breeding show jumpers, eventers and steeplechasers (the latter especially when crossed with Thoroughbreds).|$|E
500|$|Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses are mid-sized horses, with a <b>well-muscled</b> {{and compact}} build. The breed has a flat facial profile, a mid-length, well-arched neck, a deep chest and well-sloped shoulders. They {{are known to}} be {{self-sufficient}} and easy keepers. To be registered, Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses must demonstrate a [...] "gentle temperament and willing disposition" [...] to registry examiners.|$|E
500|$|Secretariat's {{length of}} stride was {{considered}} large even after {{taking into account}} his large frame and strong build. While training for the Preakness Stakes, his stride was measured as 24 feet, 11 inches.

500|$|Kiger Mustangs {{generally}} stand [...] high. They are compact, <b>well-muscled</b> horses {{with deep}} chests and short backs. In general, they are agile and intelligent, with the stamina and sure-footedness seen in many feral horse breeds. They are generally bold but gentle and calm. They {{are used for}} pleasure riding as well as endurance riding, assorted performance competition under saddle, driving, and many other situations where an athletic horse is desired.|$|E
500|$|The royal {{antelope}} exhibits remarkable alertness, {{and consequently}} {{little is known}} about its behaviour. The animal will immediately seek cover if alarmed and flees as soon as the danger is very close. It can move swiftly, either by sprinting fast with the body low to the ground, or through strong leaps powered by the large, <b>well-muscled</b> hindlegs. It can cover [...] in a single leap, and rise as high as [...] above the ground.|$|E

500|$|Kaimanawa {{horses are}} a {{population}} of feral horses in New Zealand that are descended from domestic horses released in the 19th and 20th centuries. [...] They {{are known for their}} hardiness and quiet temperament. The New Zealand government strictly controls the population to protect the habitat in which they live, which includes several endangered species of plants. The varying heritage gives the breed a wide range of heights, body patterns and colours. They are usually <b>well-muscled,</b> sure-footed and tough.|$|E
500|$|Many {{characteristics}} of the Comet type {{are said to be}} shown in the Kaimanawa horses today, although the varied gene input has produced a wide range of sizes, colours, and body types among the wild horses. [...] The Kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance, with heights ranging between [...] high. [...] Any coat colour or pattern marking is acceptable. They are usually <b>well-muscled.</b> [...] Their feral way of life has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little, and they are usually sure-footed and tough. [...] They have a medium-sized head in good proportion to their body, with wide variation in shape due to the different conformation of their ancestors. [...] Kaimanawa horses have a short, deep neck with a thick throat area, straight shoulders, a deep girth, and a short to medium back. [...] The hindquarters vary from sloping to well-rounded.

500|$|The Azteca is a horse breed from Mexico, with a subtype, {{called the}} [...] "American Azteca", {{found in the}} United States. They are <b>well-muscled</b> horses that may be of any solid color, and the American Azteca may also have pinto coloration. Aztecas are known to compete in many western riding and some English riding disciplines. The Mexican {{registry}} for the original Azteca and the United States registries for the American Azteca have registration rules that vary in several key aspects, including ancestral bloodlines and requirements for physical inspections. The Azteca was first developed in Mexico in 1972, from a blend of Andalusian, American Quarter Horse and Mexican Criollo bloodlines. From there, they spread to the United States, where American Paint Horse blood was added.|$|E

[...] Azteca stallions and geldings measure between [...] at the withers, while mares stand between [...] The ideal height is [...] [...] Both sexes usually weigh from [...] The facial profile of the breed is straight or [...] and the neck slightly arched. Overall, they are <b>well-muscled</b> horses, with broad croup and chest, as well as long, sloping shoulders. Gaits are free and mobile, with natural collection derived from the Andalusian ancestry of the breed. The breed is found in all solid colors, although gray is most often seen. White markings are allowed on the face and lower legs by breed associations. The American Azteca registry also allows non-solid pinto coloration.|$|E
500|$|The {{head has}} a {{straight}} or slightly concave facial profile, a flat forehead, and wide, short ears. A distinguishing {{characteristic of the}} breed is a [...] "beard" [...] of hair growing below the cheeks. Small white markings are allowed on the face, but never on the legs. The neck is of medium length in the modern M√©rens, and often shorter and broader in the traditional version. The shoulders are sloping and moderately long, and the chest wide and deep. Pronounced withers are favored in those M√©rens used for pack horses, but as with most mountain horses, many traditional M√©rens have wide, flat withers. The girth is deep. The back is generally shorter in modern M√©rens than in the traditional version, where horses with long, strong backs were preferred for use as pack horses. The croup is <b>well-muscled</b> and the tail low-set. The legs are strong and solid, with well-defined joints. They tend to be quite short, and some have hocks set too close together, a recurrent fault in mountain horses. The feet are large and well-formed, allowing the horses to go without shoes. There is abundant feathering on the lower legs.|$|E
500|$|The Cleveland Bay is a {{breed of}} horse that {{originated}} in England during the 17thcentury, named after its colouring and the Cleveland district of Yorkshire. It is a <b>well-muscled</b> horse, with legs that are strong but short {{in relation to}} the body. The horses are always bay in colour, although a few light hairs in the mane and tail are characteristic of some breed lines. It is the oldest established horse breed in England, and the only non-draught horse developed in Great Britain. The ancestors of the breed were developed during the Middle Ages for use as pack horses, when they gained their nickname of [...] "Chapman Horses". These pack horses were crossbred with Andalusian and Barb blood, and later with Arabians and Thoroughbreds, to create the Cleveland Bay of today. Over the years, the breed became lighter in frame as they were employed more as carriage and riding horses. The popularity of the Cleveland Bay has greatly fluctuated since it was first imported to the United States in the early 19th century. Despite serious declines in the population after the Second World War, the breed has experienced a resurgence in popularity since the 1970s, although only around 550horses existed worldwide as of 2006.|$|E

The height of the breed has increased since the end of World War II, when it stood an average of [...] The desired height today is between [...] Breeders are discouraged from breeding horses under the minimum size, but taller individuals may pass inspection if they otherwise meet requirements of the breed registry. [...] The breed has a refined head and light poll. [...] The neck is of medium length, the withers are pronounced, the shoulders sloping and the chest deep. The back is medium-long and muscular, the croup is long, slightly sloping and <b>well-muscled.</b> The legs are clean, with broad, flat knees and powerful hocks showing clear definition of tendons and ligaments. The Haflinger has rhythmic, ground-covering gaits. The walk is relaxed but energetic. The trot and canter are elastic, energetic, and athletic with a natural tendency to be light on the forehand and balanced. There is some knee action, and the canter has a very distinct motion forwards and upwards. One important consideration in breeding {{during the second half of}} the 20th century was temperament. A requirement for a quiet, kind nature has become part of official breed standards and is checked during official inspections. Some sources recognize two types of Haflinger, a shorter, heavier type used for draft work and a taller, lighter type used for pleasure riding, light driving and under-saddle competition. The Food and Agriculture Organization recognizes both an [...] "Avelignese" [...] and an [...] "Avelignese Tradizionale" [...] as existing in Italy, although, as of 2007, only 13 of the latter existed, including only one breeding stallion. However, all breed organizations recognize and register only one type.|$|E
