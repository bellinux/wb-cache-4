5|$|When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, {{he learned}} of several {{traditional}} tales relating to the area and the clan. He <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fairy Flag had three magical properties. The first was that it multiplied {{the number of men}} upon a battlefield. The second was that when it was spread upon a nuptial bed, it ensured fertility. The third was that it brought herring into the loch.|$|E
5|$|After he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dutch had {{followed}} him, Tiku ordered {{most of his}} followers to return to Tondon while he {{and a group of}} fifteen, including his two wives, continued south. They first arrived at Ambeso, but the fortress fell several days later, at which time they evacuated to Alla'. This fortress fell at the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to work his way back to Tondon through the forest. He and the other leaders, Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops. The other leaders capitulated to the Dutch and were sentenced to either three years in a prison in Makassar or exile to Buton. Tiku, meanwhile, stayed hidden in the forests.|$|E

5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{best way to}} survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought {{you would like to}} be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me {{there were a number of}} the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Sheridan {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} writer for the sitcom Shaky Ground. During his time on the show, he also worked elsewhere as a freelance writer. Following that show's cancellation in 1993, Sheridan {{was hired as}} an assistant on the show Living Single, where he wrote four episodes. Sheridan was promoted to writer, and worked on the show until it was cancelled in 1998. Shortly after, Sheridan {{received a call from}} his agent, where he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only show with an open spot was Family Guy, which Sheridan did not want to do, thinking that writing for an animated show would end his career.|$|E

Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport. From its peak of 20,994tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139tons (9,286t) in 1881.|$|E
5|$|While {{traveling}} from Shandong into North Zhili, Choe noticed {{a multitude of}} boats passing by which held officials from the Ministries of War, Justice, and Personnel. When he questioned his escorts about this, Choe <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> newly enthroned Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1488–1505) had recently impeached {{a large number of}} officials from office whom he considered inept and unworthy of their positions. Brook writes that it was quite a comfortable privilege for disgraced and dismissed officials to be escorted by the courier service, yet even this saving of face was still a firm reminder of their banishment from court.|$|E
5|$|Acadians {{continued}} {{to survive in}} the region, overcoming the results of the raids. Scott sailed back to the region to search for Beausoleil and to weaken the Acadians before the winter. He arrived in Moncton near midnight on 12 November, but the tide of the Petitcodiac River prevented him from sending more than twelve men. They came back the next morning with 16 prisoners. Scott <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area was virtually defenceless, so he sent three parties to La Chapelle (now Bore Park in Moncton), Silvabro (now Lewisville), and Jagersome (now Dieppe). Scott recorded no deaths or prisoners, but all buildings in sight were burned, and cattle were brought back onto the vessel. Additional raids by Scott between 14 and 17 November captured a dozen Acadian prisoners, burned settlements, and uncovered Beausoleil's own schooner. The crew sent an Acadian prisoner on the 17th to request the surrender of the remaining residents, but when he returned, he reported that they had all begun to flee to Cocagne, Shediac, and the settlements around the Miramichi River. This prompted Scott to return to Fort Frederick in Saint John.|$|E

5|$|Commander George Eyre {{took over}} command of Speedy in February1794. Speedy {{supported}} the siege and capture of Bastia, after which Eyre {{was ordered to}} join Diadem off Nice. While making his way there on 9June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship and <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter {{should be given to}} the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French hurried back to Gourjean roadstead outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E
5|$|Just after 9:00 PM CST (0300 UTC), a {{supercell}} {{that had}} spawned tornadoes over northern Mississippi {{as well as}} a deadly EF4 in Hardin County, Tennessee, moved to the northeast over Nashville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported there and no significant damage was reported in Nashville or Davidson County, though funnel clouds were sighted during the storm's passage. At the time the supercell moved over Nashville, a National Hockey League game between the Nashville Predators and the Carolina Hurricanes, which was nationally televised on Versus, was being played at the Sommet Center. With just over nine minutes left in the third period, Predators head coach Barry Trotz <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game may have to be stopped. Although the game continued to completion, at the game's end fans were not allowed to leave the arena until the storm had passed. National Weather Service Meteorologist Bobby Boyd theorized that cold air downbursts impinged on the development of a strong, low-level circulation as the storm moved through the Nashville area, forcing the area of rotation to remain aloft as it crossed over Davidson County and downtown Nashville.|$|E
5|$|Ole Juulson Kvale was a Minnesota congressman of the Farmer-Labor Party, and a proud Norse-American. Kvale was {{a member}} of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to {{organize}} a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration voyage. This celebration was important to a Norse-American community that had been perceived as antiwar during World War I, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation. Kvale, a Lutheran minister, was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar, seen by some as Protestant propaganda.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 19October, von Bischofhausen again met with König and <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} proposal was to be implemented the following day in order to collect the 2,300hostages. The following evening, the male Jews and communists, who had been held without food since their arrest, were shot by German troops at the barracks and courtyard where they were being held. Simultaneously, males {{between the ages of}} 16and 60were arrested within Kragujevac itself. They were detained in the barracks of a former motorised battalion at Stanovija Field. Over 7,000hostages were assembled. German troops and ethnic German units from the Banat were involved in the round-up, as was the Fifth Regiment of the SDK, under the command of Marisav Petrović. According to von Bischofhausen, König permitted several classes of males to be excluded from the round-up, including those with a special pass issued by von Bischofhausen's district headquarters, members of a vital profession or trade, and those who were members of Ljotić's movement. When too few adult males could be located, high school students were also rounded up. Also seized were priests and monks from the city's churches. Each hostage was registered and his belongings noted meticulously.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Whitlam's dismissal, the Labor {{leadership}} {{decided to}} introduce a motion that the Senate pass the appropriation bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam's sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator Doug McClelland, manager of the ALP Government's business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader Reg Withers of Labor's intent at about 1.30. Withers then attended a leadership meeting and learned of Fraser's appointment; he assured the new Prime Minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, Ken Wriedt, made the motion. Even as Wriedt did so, he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15pm, by which time {{it was too late}} to withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party's appropriation bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24pm, Labor's appropriation bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser's first promise of providing supply.|$|E
5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E
