25|$|Vector bundles {{are almost}} always {{required}} to be locally trivial, however, which means they are examples of fiber bundles. Also, the vector spaces are usually required to be over the real or complex numbers, {{in which case the}} vector bundle {{is said to be a}} real or complex vector bundle (respectively). Complex vector bundles can be viewed as real vector bundles with additional structure. In the following, <b>we</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> real vector bundles in the category of topological spaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hospital quality {{indicators}} are widely implemented for purposes such as accountability, transparency and the overarching aim of quality improvement. However, {{it is not}} clear whether currently used hospital {{quality indicators}} actually reflect quality of care. The aim of this thesis was to expand our knowledge on how to measure quality of hospital care with the <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> external comparison. I specifically investigated reliability and validity as these are key aspects of quality indicators. For reliability <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> data quality, indicator definitions and statistical uncertainty. For the validity <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> case-mix correction...|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{the frontal}} wedge of the Japan Trench and used 12 {{profiles}} of seismic reflection and refraction survey data at the frontal wedges of the Japan Trench {{to analyze the}} topographical parameters and obtain the frictional properties (Figure  1). <b>We</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> these areas because the sediments of the frontal wedge are composed only of low-P-wave velocity material (Tsuru et al. [2002]). This enables us to assume a wedge of uniform velocity and obtain approximate depth-converted data from time sections.|$|R
