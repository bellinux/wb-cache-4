Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E

They then defeated the Stormers and Bulls before losing to coach Laurie Mains’ old team the Cats in Johannesburg. Winger Aisea Tuilevu was banned for foul play following the match, and Highlander’s captain Tane Randell publicly criticised the South African judicial process. Their second loss of the season came when they played the Crusaders at Carisbrook. The Crusaders won 1716 to record to first loss for the Highlanders at Carisbrook since the 1999 finalwhich was also lost to the Crusaders. The Highlanders had gone three seasons, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and 16 games unbeaten at Carisbrook. The Highlanders then defeated the Blues 2211 to retain the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy, and inflict the only loss of the season on the Blues who {{would go on to}} win the 2003 Championship. Following the Highlander’s 4519 defeat of the Brumbies on 25 April it was revealed that a rift had developed between coach Laurie Mains and some of the senior players in the squad. Anton Oliver was branded the ringleader by Mains, but Carl Hoeft said of the conflict; [...] "Anton got hung out as ringleader, {{but a lot of the}} players had issues <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> were going and I was one of themI’m not going to hide from that".

500|$|The 2008 NFL Draft {{was held}} on April 26 and April 27, 2008, at Radio City Music Hall. In the first round, the Steelers {{selected}} running back Rashard Mendenhall, from the University of Illinois, with the 23rd overall pick. He was the first running back selected {{in the first round}} by the franchise since 1989. The Steelers selected Limas Sweed, from the University of Texas, in the second round. Sweed was ranked by the Steelers {{as one of the top}} three receivers in the draft. The drafting of Sweed came after quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's suggestion of acquiring a tall wide receiver; Sweed is 6-feet 4-inches in height. In round three, the Steelers selected Bruce Davis, of UCLA. Davis primarily played defensive end at his alma mater, however, he is expected to switch to linebacker at the pro level. The Steelers traded their fourth-round pick (123rd overall) to the New York Giants for the Giants' fourth and sixth-round selections, 130th and 194th overall, respectively. The Steelers selected offensive tackle Tony Hills with the 130th overall selection, in the fourth round. Like second-round pick Sweed, Hills came out of the University of Texas where he had been elected a captain of the football team during his senior season. With their fifth-round selection, the Steelers chose quarterback Dennis Dixon. Prior to an injury in 2007, Dixon was a Heisman Trophy candidate. The sixth round selection was the Steelers' second linebacker of the draft, Mike Humpal out of the University of Iowa. Also in the sixth round, the final selection of the team was safety Ryan Mundy, a Pittsburgh native. The Steelers did not pick in the seventh round, due to a 2007 trade with the Atlanta Falcons. Kevin Colbert, Director of Football Operations, said of the draft, [...] "we’re happy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> turned out." [...] Also stating that the first and second-round selections were players who the team expected to have already been chosen. Coach Mike Tomlin said that the Steelers tried to select skilled offensive [...] "weapons" [...] over a strong offensive line, which struggled the previous season. The following day, the Steelers signed twelve free-agent rookies. All draft picks agreed to terms by July 25, two days prior to the start of training camp.|$|E

40|$|Originating {{high in the}} San Juan Mountains of Colorado, the Animas River has had {{a century}} long history with acid mine runoff. The river serves as the primary water source for many {{downstream}} farm operations. As a result, the potential for soil contamination is a concern for these farmers. The objective {{of this study was}} to understand the consequences that a flooding event could have on farm operations in the Animas River Valley, examine methods used by farmers to limit soil exposure from heavy metals found in the Animas River, and evaluate mitigations tactics being implemented by La Plata County. All four commercial farms in the Animas River Valley were contacted and three responded for an interview. Along with these interviews, Darrin Parmenter La Plata County's Colorado State University extension director for agriculture was also interviewed. Farmers were asked questions regarding flood mitigation, soil contamination, and historical events that could have contaminated their fields. Their responses varied. Two farmers were unconcerned about the threats of flooding and the possibility of soil contamination through irrigation. One farmer was very concerned about the impacts of acid mine runoff affecting his farm through irrigation and flooding. Their polarized responses seem consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> community’s perception of the condition of the river.

40|$|French philosopher Gilles Deleuze (1925 - 1995) revolted {{against the}} negativity that, he believed, plagues {{much of the}} {{mainstream}} philosophical canon. Whether by uncovering a hidden truth beneath appearances, or by postulating an afterlife or utopian future, traditional philosophy often expresses discontent <b>with</b> life and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> are, {{and a desire to}} transcend or transform it. There are, however, notable exceptions to this rule, and Deleuze often singled out three authors in particular as forming a counter-canon, still to be followed and explored: Lucretius (99 - 55 BCE), Spinoza (1632 - 1677), and Nietzsche (1844 - 1900). All three, he argued, maintain a resolutely affirmative approach to philosophy and life, focusing on the beauty and creativity of nature rather than its evils and supposed flaws, and reject all appeals to anything beyond, behind, beneath, or above this world and this life. Deleuze alternately described this approach as “naturalism”, “philosophy of immanence” (as opposed to transcendentalism), and “affirmative philosophy”. To appreciate the special status and value that Deleuze attributes to these philosophers, we will closely read one book by each. We will grasp, that seriously engaging with their thought requires questioning some of our deepest held convictions about truth and morality, and about ourselves. Can we truly think and experience life, as Lucretius and Spinoza urge us, without being in the least concerned about death? Is it possible, and desirable, to approach life, as Nietzsche puts it, “beyond good and evil”, and to celebrate it {{even in the face of}} violence and brutality? And what does it mean to “affirm life”; what is it we do when we affirm it...|$|R

We {{do not know whether}} or not that bedizened cutthroat was satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> turned out; for having had the idea of going to Charles Town and obliging the prisoners to help him confiscate the drugs and chemicals, he may have preferred this unusual proceeding to a more commonplace transaction; but as the medicine had arrived he accepted it, and having secured all possible booty and money from the ships he had captured, and had stripped his prisoners of the greater part of their clothing, he set them on shore to walk to Charles Town as well as they could. They had a miserably difficult time, making their way through the woods and marshes, for there were women and children among them who were scarcely equal to the journey. One of the children was a little boy, the son of Mr. Wragg, who afterward became a very prominent man in the colonies. He rose to such a high position, not only among his countrymen, but in the opinion of the English government, that when he died, about the beginning of the Revolution, a tablet to his memory was placed in Westminster Abbey, which is, perhaps, the first instance of such an honor being paid to an American.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the research on organizational culture (OC) from a crosscountry perspective. From the economic point of view we see that society today has led us to increasing international cooperation and globalization. Despite the opening of economic borders there are still limits to consider when operating across national boundaries. One of those limits can be associated <b>with</b> culture – <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> are commonly understood and accepted in different national entities. This can be of special importance for small countries, as they need to adjust to their larger counterparts {{in order to be}} economically competitive. Research focuses on different aspects when studying OC, but it is generally agreed that task orientation and interpersonal relationships become important dimensions when we analyze this phenomenon. In order to understand OC and to measure it in cross cultural settings, a universal measurement tool is needed; however, drafting such a tool has for some time been a sticky task. In this paper the measurement invariance of the Organizational Culture Questionnaire (Vadi et al. 2002) is examined by comparing the data from seven countries representing Eastern and Western Europe, Russia, and China. This sample covers both small and large countries. A confirmative factor analysis was used as a means to test measurement invariance across the selected samples. In addition, Multidimensional Scaling technique was applied to provide a visual representation of the data. An analysis was carried out using the statistical software SPSS/AMOS 17. 0. The results indicate that task orientation can be found as a common dimension whereas relationship orientation seems to hold a diverse meaning across countries. Instead of relationship orientation, a dimension reflecting negative employee emotions towards the organization was detected. It also turned out that the strength {{of the relationship between the}} obtained subscales shows interesting variation across countries. These findings potentially allow us to better understand and lead international collaboration between countries and organizations...|$|R
