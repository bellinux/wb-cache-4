He has dinner with Sloan’s father, Terrence, but is shocked when Terrence asks him to sign a prenuptial agreement. Eric gets upset and confronts Sloan about it, telling him that they <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> about it when he returns home and then agrees.

5|$|Monsters <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> to {{the player}} during the battle, {{and the game}} will tell the players what the monster's {{feelings}} and actions are. Enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them: should players choose non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, whereas they become difficult if players choose violent options. The game relies {{on a number of}} metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.|$|E

5|$|The agents later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives the agents permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no older than her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> to Chaco.|$|E

500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> to you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E

500|$|That September, Yeats {{proposed}} to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892–1968), known as George, {{whom he had}} met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends—"George... you can't. He must be dead"—Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October. Their marriage was a success, {{in spite of the}} age difference, and in spite of Yeats's feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband [...] "When you are dead, people <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were." ...|$|E
500|$|Locke is {{a member}} of a commune in Humboldt County, California. He {{considers}} its members his new family. One day Locke picks up a young hitchhiker, named Eddie Colburn (Justin Chatwin), who tells him he is leaving home. Eddie joins the commune, but after six weeks, he asks Locke why he is never allowed to {{know what is going on}} in a greenhouse (into which he sees an exceptional amount of fertilizer going). Eddie expresses his discontent with being kept out of the secret and affirms to Locke his desire to be in on [...] "whatever you guys are trying to blow up". Locke laughs and says he <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> to the commune leaders, Mike (Chris Mulkey) and Jan (Virginia Morris).|$|E
500|$|The notes {{show him}} asking: [...] "Who told you that?" [...] When the detectives {{said they had}} witnesses, he {{reportedly}} said: [...] "They are only kids. No {{one is going to}} believe them." [...] The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes, saying: [...] "You cunts, you cunts," [...] and [...] "Jesus, Jesus," [...] then: [...] "You ain't got enough evidence. Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> to you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: [...] "You're too slow, man, they gone." [...] He was at that point charged with murder, to which he reportedly responded: [...] "They won't give evidence against me." ...|$|E

Or <b>will</b> you <b>talk</b> of politics or travel? Or would you rather be frivolous with my niece and nephew? That, I think, is Esther playing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite, I think," [...] he answered, [...] "but {{let that}} pass. Listen! If you <b>will</b> not <b>talk</b> {{to me about}} these things, <b>will</b> you <b>talk</b> to my friend, Jarvis Spencer?

500|$|The Duke, [...] "much {{thinner and}} greatly altered", {{returned}} to England in November. His relationship with Anne had suffered further setbacks {{in recent months}} (she had refused to grant him his requested appointment of Captain-General for life, and had interfered in military appointments). The damage done to Marlborough's general standing was substantial {{because it was so}} visible. For now, though, the central issue was the Duchess whose growing resentment of Harley and Abigail had finally persuaded the Queen to be rid of her. Marlborough visited Anne on 17 January 1711 (O.S.) in a last attempt to save his wife, but she was not to be swayed, and demanded Sarah give up her Gold Key (the symbol of her office) within two days, warning, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> of no other business till I have the key".|$|E
500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets. [...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> about you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when you get on the bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E
500|$|Late goals {{scored by}} Gallas and Rosický {{at home to}} Wigan Athletic kept Arsenal three points clear of Manchester United in the league table, {{at the end of}} November. The win at Villa Park against Aston Villa in December, moved Arsenal five points clear {{at the top of the}} league table, and {{provoked}} speculation as to whether the club could go another league season unbeaten; Wenger responded, [...] "People <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> ... just let us play." [...] The team played out a 1–1 draw at Newcastle United four days after and lost against Middlesbrough, ending a record of 22 league matches unbeaten. Arsenal beat Chelsea 1–0 on 16 December 2007 and needed a late goal, scored by from substitute Nicklas Bendtner to win against Tottenham Hotspur. In spite of a draw at Portsmouth on Boxing Day, which moved Arsenal down to second place, a win against Everton helped the club move past Manchester United to the first-place spot.|$|E

500|$|Gallagher {{maintains}} that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine NME and members of Blur's entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that since this point he has had no respect for either party. However, Albarn has suggested {{the roots of the}} feud were much more personal. By 2007, the tension between the two had cooled, and in an NME interview, Gallagher said [...] "I've got {{a lot of respect for}} Damon, I really do mean it. Because I'm indifferent to Damon he thinks that I think he's a cunt. Our Liam <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> to him, I won't because he's just another singer in a band to me, but I don't think he's a cunt. Good luck to him!" [...] On 23 March 2013, Gallagher, Damon, Graham Coxon and Paul Weller performed the Blur hit [...] "Tender" [...] at the Teenage Cancer Trust. Gallagher provided backing vocals on the song [...] "We Got the Power" [...] with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, on Albarn's Gorillaz project, from their album Humanz.|$|E
500|$|After the Netherlands' exit at Euro 2000, Overmars {{was asked}} whether he would stay at Arsenal. He replied: [...] "I really don't {{want to talk about}} it at the moment but you never know. There are some {{meetings}} with the club going on, we <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> over the next week." [...] Lazio and Barcelona were reportedly interested in signing Overmars; the latter club hastened their efforts once Joan Gaspart was elected as president. Overmars was [...] "flattered" [...] by Barcelona's interest and said moving to such a club would [...] "excite any player". Gaspart travelled to London to open negotiations with Arsenal and eventually reached an agreement to sign Overmars and his teammate Emmanuel Petit for a combined fee of around £32million in July 2000. Overmars cost £25million, making him the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The announcement of his transfer was unconventional; he publicised it on his personal website before informing the media. His site garnered 250,000 hits in one day, highlighting the internet's [...] "potential for exponential growth" [...] in regards to football. Overmars was delighted with the move, saying, [...] "I can't wait to pull on the famous shirt and play my first game." ...|$|E
500|$|While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he {{was only}} repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the {{concession}} itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his izinDuna, Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo. The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his izinDuna to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the Mazoe valley, the king replied [...] "Take my men to England for me; and when you return, then I <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> about that." [...] Johannes Colenbrander, a frontiersman from Natal, was recruited to accompany the Matabele emissaries as an interpreter. They left in mid-December 1888.|$|E

500|$|The early 1950s {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a slump in Grant's career. His roles as a top brain surgeon who is {{caught in the middle of}} a bitter revolution in a Latin American country in Crisis, and as a medical-school professor and orchestra conductor opposite Jeanne Crain in People <b>Will</b> <b>Talk</b> were poorly received. [...] Grant had become tired of being Cary Grant after twenty years, being successful, wealthy and popular, and remarked: [...] "To play yourself, your true self, is the hardest thing in the world". In 1952, Grant starred in the comedy Room for One More, playing an engineer husband who with his wife (Betsy Drake) adopt two children from an orphanage. He reunited with Howard Hawks to film the off-beat comedy Monkey Business, co-starring Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe. Though the critic from Motion Picture Herald wrote gushingly that Grant had given a career's best with an [...] "extraordinary and agile performance", which was matched by Rogers, it received a mixed reception overall. Grant had hoped that starring opposite Deborah Kerr in the romantic comedy Dream Wife would salvage his career, but it was a critical and financial failure upon release in July 1953. Though he was considered for the leading part in A Star is Born, Grant believed that his film career was over, and briefly left the industry.|$|E
500|$|In Philadelphia, Henry Fairfield Osborn is {{introducing}} artist Charles R. Knight to Edward Drinker Cope, a paleontologist whose entire house {{is filled with}} bones and specimens. Cope is commissioning a painting, something to [...] "catch the spirit" [...] of the sea creature Elasmosaurus (but has unwittingly mistaken its neck for a tail). Cope then leaves for the West, as the official scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). On the way, he meets Othniel Charles Marsh, a fellow paleontologist, and shows him his dig site at a marl pit in New Jersey; after Cope leaves, Marsh talks to {{the owner of the}} land and pays him off to gain exclusive digging rights. At Fort Bridger, Wyoming, Cope meets Sam Smith, a helper to the USGS. During excavations, Cope finds some of the richest bone veins ever. Sending back carloads of dinosaur bones east by train, Cope encounters Marsh, who is heading out west as well. Marsh travels in style, lounging in coach while the rest of his team travels third class—Marsh even berates them for playing cards, saying it is [...] "low class" [...] and that Yale graduates should look more presentable. [...] At Fort McPherson, Nebraska, Marsh meets [...] "Buffalo" [...] Bill Cody, who serves as their guide, along with the Native American Indian tribe. Marsh discovers many new fossils, and promises to Chief Red Cloud that he <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> to the President of the United States about the situation of the Native Americans—they have been given spoiled food in exchange for their land. Back East, Knight has finished his reconstruction of Elasmosaurus. He and Knight return to the marl pits of New Jersey, but are forced away. Cope becomes furious and storms away when he learns Marsh has bought the digging rights and published a paper revealing his interpretation of Elasmosaurus flawed.|$|E
