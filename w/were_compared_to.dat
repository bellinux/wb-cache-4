5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these <b>were</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They considered Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which <b>were</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that <b>were</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies <b>were</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E

5|$|There {{is still}} a huge demand for Villeneuve memorabilia at the race-track shops and several books {{have been written about}} him.

Villeneuve's son, Jacques, drove the #27 during his IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 winning season with Team Green, and has also used the number for occasional drives in NASCAR and the Speedcar Series. Canadian driver Andrew Ranger used number 27 in the 2005 and 2006 Champ Car seasons, and continued using the number at NASCAR Canadian Tire Series since 2007. Canadian driver and 2011 IndyCar Rookie of the Year James Hinchcliffe adopted the number 27 for the 2012 season when he joined Andretti Autosport (former Andretti Green Racing).|$|E
