5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E

Though generally depicted <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>arms,</b> manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist.

25|$|Parvati (Sanskrit: , IAST: Pārvatī) is a Hindu goddess. Shaiva {{tradition}} {{is replete with}} a number of form of goddesses and all of the consorts, Parvati is the most celebrated and artistic. Parvati is nominally the second consort of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and rejuvenation. However, she is not different from Satī, being the reincarnation of Shiva's wife. Parvati is the mother of the gods and goddess, Ganesha and Skanda (Kartikeya). Some communities believe her to be the sister of Vishnu. Parvati, when depicted alongside Shiva, generally appears <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>arms,</b> but when alone, she is shown having four or eight arms, and astride a tiger or lion. Generally considered a benevolent goddess, Parvati also has wrathful incarnations, such as Durga, Kali, Shitala Devi, Tara, Chandi, and the Mahavidyas as well as benevolent forms like Kathyayini, Mahagauri, Kamalatmika, Bhuvaneshwari, and Lalita.|$|E

The area around it is now a political jurisdiction of Mexico City, Álvaro Obregón, D.F. The monument to Obregón is the largest to a single revolutionary. It was constructed in the place where Obregón was assassinated. The monument held Obregón severed, and over the years, increasingly deteriorating right arm that he lost in 1915. The monument now has a marble sculpture of the severed arm, after the arm itself was incinerated in 1989. Obregón's body after his 1928 assassination is buried in Huatabampo, Sonora, rather than the Monument to the Revolution in downtown Mexico City where other revolutionaries are now entombed. In Sonora, Obregón is honored with an equestrian statue, where he is shown as a vigorous soldier <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parvati, {{the gentle}} aspect of Devi Shakti, is usually {{represented}} as fair, beautiful, and benevolent. She typically wears a red dress (often a sari), {{and may have}} a head-band. When depicted alongside Shiva, she generally appears <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>arms,</b> but when alone, she may be depicted having four. These hands may hold a conch, crown, mirror, rosary, bell, dish, farming tool such as goad, sugarcane stalk, or flowers such as lotus. One of her arms in front {{may be in the}} Abhaya mudra (hand gesture for 'fear not'), one of her children, typically Ganesha, is on her knee, while her younger son Skanda may be playing near her in her watch. In ancient temples, Parvati's sculpture is often depicted near a calf or cow - a source of food. Bronze has been the chief metal for her sculpture, while stone is next most common material.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Adopus aculeatus and veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{were found}} to walk on two arms, {{while at the same}} time {{mimicking}} plant matter.

A study of this behaviour led to the suggestion that the two rearmost appendages may be more accurately termed [...] "legs" [...] rather than [...] "arms". Some species of octopus can crawl out of the water briefly, which they may do between tide pools while hunting crustaceans or gastropods or to escape predators.

500|$|Baba himself {{maintained}} an ambiguous profile, unwilling {{to identify with}} {{either of the two}} religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: [...] "You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?" [...] Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was [...] "Allah rakhega vaiia rahena", that is, [...] "Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah." [...] On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.|$|E
500|$|The {{transition}} from treatment to storyboards {{took on an}} extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, A Bug's Life required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters. Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would {{give way to the}} film's larger needs. The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive. The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants. The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants. The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual [...] "universal ants". Each one of these [...] "universal ants" [...] would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same. It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems {{a decade and a half}} earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.|$|E
