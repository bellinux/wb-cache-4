50|$|The Steregushchiy-class corvettes have a steel {{hull and}} {{composite}} material superstructure, with a bulbous bow and nine <b>watertight</b> <b>subdivisions.</b> They have a combined bridge and command centre, and space and weight provision for eight SS-N-25 missiles. Stealth technology was widely used during {{construction of the}} ships, as well as 21 patents and 14 new computer programs. Newest physical field reduction solutions were applied too. As a result, designers considerably reduced the ship's radar signature thanks to hull architecture and fire-resistant radar-absorbent fiberglass applied in tophamper's design.|$|R
50|$|The Gremyashchiy-class corvettes {{differ from}} their {{predecessors}} of the Steregushchiy class by greater dimensions and displacement. They have a steel hull and composite superstructure, with a bulbous bow and nine <b>watertight</b> <b>subdivisions.</b> Compared with the Soobrazitelny, Boikiy, Sovershennyy and Stoikiy ships, which are fitted with Redut air defense VLS system of 12 launchers on the bow, these new ships {{are equipped with}} a UKSK VLS system comprising 8 launchers for SS-N-27 or SS-N-26 cruise missiles instead. The Redut VLS system with 16 launchers has been replaced on the stern. Another difference {{is the lack of}} the aft mast above the helicopter hangar, and single integrated mainmast that no longer includes separate open shelves for artillery and navigation radars.|$|R
25|$|A ship will sink if the {{transverse}} bulkheads are so {{far apart}} that flooding a single compartment would consume all the ship's reserve buoyancy. Aside from the possible protection of machinery, or areas most susceptible to damage, such a ship would be no better than a ship without <b>watertight</b> <b>subdivision,</b> and is called a one-compartment ship. A ship capable of remaining afloat when any single watertight compartment is flooded is called a two-compartment ship, but damage destroying the tightness of a transverse bulkhead may cause flooding of two compartments and loss of the ship. A ship able to remain afloat with any two compartments flooded is called a three-compartment ship, and will withstand damage to one transverse bulkhead.|$|E

500|$|According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles, Zähringen and {{her sisters}} were to be demilitarized. This would permit the newly reorganized Reichsmarine to retain the vessels for {{auxiliary}} purposes. Zähringen was therefore stricken from the navy list on 11 March 1920 and disarmed. She was then used as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven until 1926. That year, the Reichsmarine decided to rebuild Zähringen into a radio-controlled target ship, similar to vessels operated by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy. Accordingly, work started on the conversion that year, and lasted through 1928. The ship had its engine system overhauled; the three-shaft arrangement {{was replaced by a}} pair of [...] 3-cylinder, vertical triple expansion engines. These were supplied with steam by two naval oil-fired, water-tube boilers.

50|$|The inquiry {{was only}} able to {{establish}} {{the reasons for the}} vessel becoming flooded. It found that the vessel would have begun to flood due to the fractured cooling pipe. The bilge pumps were unserviceable due to becoming blocked. Joyita lacked <b>watertight</b> bulkheads or <b>subdivisions</b> in the bilges. The water would have gradually flooded the lower decks. As the boat began to sink lower into the water, the one remaining engine {{would not have been able}} to maintain enough speed to steer. Joyita then fell beam-on to a heavy swell and took on the heavy list it was found with. While flooded to an extent which would sink a conventional vessel, Joyita stayed afloat due to her cork-lined hull and cargo of fuel drums.|$|R

50|$|The British 1942 design light fleet carrier was a {{scaled-down}} {{version of}} their Illustrious-class fleet carrier. The design {{could be built}} in a yard {{with little or no}} experience of warship construction. Although built to merchant standards, the design incorporated better <b>watertight</b> <b>subdivision.</b> Expected to have a lifetime of about three years, the last of the design was taken out of service in 2001. The first eight were built as the Colossus but revisions upgrading the design to handle larger and heavier aircraft led to the remainder being the Majestic class. In the post-war period, the Royal Navy operated a force of ten Colossus class carriers including the two maintenance carriers. In all, fifteen ships were completed from the 1942 design, of which most of the Colossus class and all the eventually completed Majestics were variously sold to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India and the Netherlands. By 1939, HMS Hermes was being considered as equivalent to a light aircraft carrier, due to her small size and lack of armour.|$|E
50|$|She {{was fitted}} out for United States Navy service at Tietjen & Lang's {{shipyard}} at Hoboken, New Jersey. Work began on 16 November 1917. Gun platforms were added for two anti-aircraft guns forward and a 5"/51 caliber gun aft. The minelaying conversion {{enabled her to}} carry mines on three decks, and included six Otis elevators individually capable of transferring two mines every 20 seconds from the storage decks to the launching deck. Stern ports were cut for launching the mines and the rudder quadrant was raised to give adequate clearance. <b>Watertight</b> <b>subdivision</b> was improved by strengthening existing bulkheads and building two new bulkheads to divide the largest compartments so the ship might stay afloat if only one compartment were flooded. Quarters were enlarged to accommodate messing and berthing arrangements for a crew of about 400. The main machinery was overhauled and auxiliary machinery was added for the elevators, for heating the berthing spaces, for refrigerated food storage, for additional fresh water distilling capacity, for magazine sprinklers and galley and washroom plumbing, and enlarged electric generators for lighting and radio communications. Existing coal bunkers on the third deck were replaced with a bunker in the hold forward of the boiler room with chutes to load coal over the mines. Larger boats and heavier anchors required larger davits and anchor windlass, and the mines required specialized handling machinery.|$|E
40|$|Design of <b>watertight</b> <b>subdivision</b> {{inherently}} involves its optimization {{with the}} objective to increase the index “A” above its minimum required value. In view of a big popularity of probabilistic search methods such as genetic algorithms, this task is intrinsically time consuming. Thus, even when an optimal subdivision layout (i. e. topology) is determined, {{it can be found}} that the optimal bulkhead positions can be a great challenge time-wise, often forcing designers to satisfy with suboptimal solutions. The fundamental reason why this happens is that the nature of the optimized function (e. g., index “A” as a function of bulkhead positions) is unknown and hence it has no effect upon the choice of optimization strategy, which therefore reflects subjective but not factual preferences. In this paper we study the nature of functional dependency between the subdivision index and bulkhead positions, as a simplest case, and indicate pertinent optimization strategies that consequently reduce the optimization time. In our study we use a cruise ship model to demonstrate the application results of our findings...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to generating, evaluating, and optimizing general arrangements of naval surface ships is presented. Beginning from a user editable database of spaces, the algorithms return an optimized arrangement. The user drives the design by quantitatively defining spaces’ goals and constraints for location, proximity, and shape. The arrangements task is undertaken in two parts: Allocation and Arrangement. Allocation is the assignment of a space to a region of a ship. The unit region used is dubbed a Zone-deck. The Zone-deck is the intersection of one deck and one <b>watertight</b> <b>subdivision.</b> The allocation solution evaluates Zone-deck area utilization and spaces’ relative and global position goals. Adjacency and separation distance between spaces is measured in increments of deck and subdivision. Global position is assessed by deck and subdivision. Each discrete distance and position has an editable default fuzzy preference value. Allocation is essentially a very large scale combinatorial bin packing problem. With the added complexity of relative location constraints, this also becomes a type of quadratic assignment problem. The independent variable vector is an ordered listing by space index number of each space’s assigned Zonedeck index number. A customized Genetic Algorithm optimizes the integer-coded chromosome. The second part arranges one Zone-deck at a time. Arrangement is done in two iterative steps: topology and geometry. Topology gives the relative longitudinal and transverse position of each space’s seed location. These locations are translated onto an orthogonal grid. In the second step, spaces are expanded to have size and shape filling the available area in the stochastic growth loop. Spaces are defined by up to three contiguous boxes allowing for L, T, C and Z shapes. The arrangement cost function evaluates each space’s required area satisfaction, aspect ratio, minimum overall dimension, minimum segment dimension, perimeter, connectivity to access, and proximity constraints to other spaces. Editable piecewise linear fuzzy utility functions translate each criteria measure to a fuzzy utility. The best of a modest number of geometry solutions returns joiner bulkhead locations and a cost function value to a Genetic Algorithm optimization of the topology chromosome...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the {{feasibility}} of purchasing and converting the Rob Humphrey’s design Ocean Phoenix 77 (OP 77) into a luxury, disabled access, blue water cruising yacht, which is able to operate in unlimited areas. The vessel is presently {{for sale in the}} Mediterranean for offers around € 2, 900, 000 and is reported to be in near new condition. Built by Hamble Yacht Services in 2002 her hull is built to American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) compliance and she is classed as Recreational Craft Directive (RCD) Category A with 3 watertight subdivisions which will not keep her afloat if her main saloon floods. The vessel is also just below the Large Yacht Code (LY 2) code required minimum length. The rules and guidelines of the relevant regulatory bodies will be examined and any loopholes and ramifications of these will be discussed. The feasibility study will assess the suitability of the vessel against the most pertinent stability and structural classification criteria. In order to comply with Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA) Small Commercial Vessel (SCV) unlimited operation requirements, the vessel will need to be fitted with at least one additional <b>watertight</b> <b>subdivision</b> to ensure compliance with the minimum freeboard requirement of 75 mm should the integrity of any one compartment be affected. The vessel’s suitability for the proposed usage will be examined as will the likely take up by disabled guests. The projected running costs and estimated price of conversion will establish a required financial return and the project {{will examine the}} possibility of a bespoke new build alternative. The paper will assess the specific requirements of guests with disabilities and will focus on ensuring that the vessel is as manageable and comfortable as possible whilst ensuring their dignity and retaining a degree of versatility which will not alienate able bodied guests. Access and safety are key issues and will be assessed with a view to making the vessel easier to operate for guests of differing abilities. The General Arrangement (GA) will be assessed and two different configurations will be proposed which comply with classification requirements whilst offering versatility and ease of use to the widest range of abilities. This assessment will include the rig and sail control systems with a view to making them as user friendly as possible with minimum disruption and cost. Stability and code compliance will be reassessed once precise details of the proposed alterations are known. The range will be assessed regarding fuel and fresh water supplies and the vessel’s powering and propulsion will be assessed to ensure that the current arrangements are still suitable for the converted vessel...|$|E
