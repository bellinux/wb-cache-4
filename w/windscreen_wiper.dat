5|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 29 December, the naked body {{of a young woman}} was found dumped at a lay-by on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a {{motorist}} who had stopped to change a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E
25|$|If {{the items}} in {{question}} are repaired, replaced or removed from the vehicle, {{the right of the}} owner to appeal becomes null and void. Failure because of items easily replaceable, such as tyres or <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> blades, may not be appealed against, as it cannot be adequately determined if they were the ones fitted at the time of inspection.|$|E
25|$|The eyelids {{of a bird}} are {{not used}} in blinking. Instead the eye is {{lubricated}} by the nictitating membrane, a third concealed eyelid that sweeps horizontally across the eye like a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds when they are under water. When sleeping, the lower eyelid rises to cover the eye in most birds, {{with the exception of}} the horned owls where the upper eyelid is mobile.|$|E

2500|$|In 1949 {{the first}} {{delivered}} 2CV type A was 375 cc, 9hp, with a [...] top speed, only one tail light and <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> with speed shaft drive; the wiper speed {{was dependent on}} the driving speed. The car was heavily criticised by the motoring press and became the butt of French comedians for a short while. [...] One American motoring journalist quipped, [...] "Does it come with a can opener?" [...] The British Autocar correspondent wrote that the 2CV [...] "is {{the work of a}} designer who has kissed the lash of austerity with almost masochistic fervour".|$|E
2500|$|In December 1949, a Deluxe {{version was}} added to the range. This has a Villiers 6E [...] engine, which had an {{increased}} output to [...] and a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton. [...] There were also a number of modest refinements including a spare wheel and a single wing mirror. The manually operated <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> fitted on the standard car was upgraded to an electric Lucas type. Although this was found to damage the original perspex windscreen, it was not replaced by a Triplex Safety Glass screen until the introduction of the Mark B in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|In Rated X (2000), a fact-based film {{directed}} by and starring Emilio Estevez, Clark played the younger version of Charlie Sheen's character; a boy physically abused {{by his father}} who would grow up to become an adult film director. Following this, Clark had a more prominent role as a street <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> who donates his life savings of $4.30 to a murder investigation in the A Network's original film , the pilot for the A series A Nero Wolfe Mystery. Variety's Steve Oxman spoke highly of the production, calling the cast [...] "a stellar ensemble" [...] and noting that [...] "the performances are {{more than the sum}} of their parts".|$|E

2500|$|British-made Mokes were {{fitted with}} a low-end 848cc {{transverse}} inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10inch wheels as the standard Mini. In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable canvas top were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves. The base price was GB£ 405. The [...] "Mk I" [...] Mokes had a single <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> and a floor-mounted headlight dip switch, and the only colour available was [...] "Spruce Green". In 1967, the [...] "Mk II" [...] Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.|$|E
2500|$|The non-fatal {{accident}} occurred on 5 August 1956. The aircraft, a Handley Page HP.81 Hermes 4A (registration: G-ALDK), [...] undershot the runway {{while attempting to}} land on runway 08 at the Drigh Road Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Base in heavy rain, which the pilot in command mistook for Karachi International Airport's runway 07. Although the accident destroyed the aircraft, all 72 occupants (seven crew members and 65 passengers) survived. The subsequent accident investigation established {{the failure of the}} aircraft's left <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> as the primary cause. It furthermore identified the pilot's mistake in confusing runway 08 at Drigh Road PAF Base with runway 07 at Karachi International Airport when landing in meteorological conditions below those recommended as minima by the Pakistan Department of Civil Aviation as a secondary cause.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the 124's {{engineering}} {{and many of}} its features were advanced automotive technology at its introduction, incorporating innovations that have been adopted throughout the industry. It had one of the lowest coefficient of drag (Cd) of any vehicle of the time (0.28 for the 200/200D model for the European market with 185/65 R15 tires) due to its aerodynamic body, that included plastic molding for the undercarriage to streamline airflow beneath the car, reducing fuel consumption and wind noise. It had a single <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> that had an eccentric mechanism at its base that extended the wiper's reach to the top corners of the windscreen (more than if it had traveled in a simple arc). The saloon/sedan, coupés and convertibles had optional rear headrests that would fold down remotely to improve rearward visibility when required. This feature was not available for the T-model because of its specific layout (no space to store the retractable headrests), but the estate serially came with a [...] "neighbour-friendly" [...] rear door that was pulled in the shut-position silently and automatically by a sensor-controlled servomotor. This allowed the use of a tighter fitting rear gate, minimizing the cabin noise in the T-model - sometimes an area of concern for station wagons.|$|E

50|$|Where {{a supply}} of vacuum is available, but not {{pneumatic}} power, rotary actuators have even been made to work from vacuum power. The only common instance of these was for early automatic <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> on cars up until around 1960. These used the manifold vacuum of a petrol engine to work a quarter-turn oscillating vane actuator. Such <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> worked adequately when the engine was running under light load, but they were notorious that when working hard at top speed or climbing a hill, the manifold vacuum was reduced and the wipers slowed to a crawl.|$|R

50|$|In April 1908, {{he drove}} down to Crystal Palace Park in a 1904 Darracq-Charron {{motorcar}} to see Newcastle United play against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. It was such a novelty to see a car in those days that it was put into a car showroom window while he was there, {{because so many people}} wanted to see it. On the way back from the cup final, snow kept getting on the windscreen and Gladstone had to keep {{getting out of the car}} to clear it. This experience led to his invention of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In April 1911, Gladstone patented the design of a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> with Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool. Gladstone's version of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> was never manufactured, however. His original prototype can be seen in Newcastle's Discovery Museum.|$|E
