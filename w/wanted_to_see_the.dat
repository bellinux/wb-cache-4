5|$|Suleiman {{said that}} he had come to protect John Sigismund's interests, but also {{announced}} that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> town. This {{turned out to be a}} trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.|$|E

5|$|Latter Days {{was filmed}} in several {{locations}} in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $850,000 budget.

However producer Kirkland Tibbels still faced several bottlenecks, as financing the whole film remained difficult. It was distributed through TLA Releasing, an independent film distributor, who picked it up through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films, which specializes in gay-themed media.|$|E

5|$|After the Met and the District had {{withdrawn}} from the ELR in 1906, services were provided by the South Eastern Railway, the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (LB) and the Great Eastern Railway. Both the Met and the District <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> line electrified, but could not justify the whole cost themselves. Discussions continued, and in 1911 {{it was agreed that}} the ELR would be electrified with the UERL providing power and the Met the train service. Parliamentary powers were obtained in 1912 and through services restarted on 31 March 1913, the Met running two trains an hour from both the SER's and the LB's New Cross stations to South Kensington and eight shuttles an hour alternately from the New Cross stations to Shoreditch.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War {{ended in}} 1945, Hampden started to host Scotland matches more frequently. Before then, Hampden had only hosted 15 matches against England and one match each against Austria and Czechoslovakia. During the post-war {{attendance}} boom, Hampden {{was the only}} stadium big enough to host the crowds who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> team. Matches that would have ordinarily attracted a crowd of 40,000 were being attended by nearly 100,000. The Hampden fixture list was also expanded by the new Scottish League Cup competition. In 1947, Rangers defeated Aberdeen in the first League Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo DavidsonA United States Air Force {{astronaut}} who accidentally opens {{a portal}} to another world inhabited by talking human-like apes and is captured by them. Leo leads a rebellion of the planet's humans. Wahlberg had {{backed out of}} a commitment to Ocean's Eleven to take this role in Planet of the Apes. (Matt Damon was eventually cast in the Ocean's Eleven role.) Whereas other actors contending for the Leo Davidson role <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> script before signing a contract, Wahlberg signed on after a five-minute meeting with Burton. To avoid evoking associations with his previous work as an underwear model, Wahlberg did not wear a loincloth, even though Heston had worn one in the original film.|$|E

5|$|The new construction, {{part of the}} city's and the MTA's {{master plan}} for the Far West Side, {{extended}} the IRT Flushing Line west from Times Square to Eleventh Avenue, then south to 34th Street. Although the West Side Stadium plan was rejected by city and state planning agencies, the 7 Subway Extension plan received approval to move ahead, as New York political leaders <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> warehouse district west of Eighth Avenue and north of 34th Street redeveloped {{as part of the}} Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, and subway service was to be an essential part of that effort. The extension also serves the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which was expanded in 2008–2014 and is located a block away from the station entrances.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E

Lady Edwards apparently found him in the pantry; he was arrested by the police but no charges were laid. Ill health forced Edwards to resign his vice-regal appointment on 2 April 1975, and he and Lady Edwards went to live in Sydney, where he continued in semi-retirement with commercial interests.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the Legislative Council as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the Albanian resistance {{was supposed to be}} fierce, but Alfonso <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> League become powerful enough to seriously challenge the Ottoman Empire, much unlike the Venetians who were troubled by the growing Albanian state. In May, Alfonso sent two experienced Catalan officers with 200 men and plenty of supplies to Krujë and, on 7 June 1451, he established an alliance with George Arianiti, the most powerful League member from southern Albania. Later that same year, Alfonso created similar alliances with John Musachi, George Stres Balsha, Muzaka Thopia, Peter Himariot, and Simon Zenevishi, all important Albanian nobles allied to Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg was pleased with Alfonso, but dissension in the League over political issues was still present. Paul Dukagjini and Peter Spani remained aligned with Venice and established friendly relations with the Sultan.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.|$|E
