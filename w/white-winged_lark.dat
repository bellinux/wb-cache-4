50|$|Melanocorypha larks are large, robust birds, 16.5-20 cm {{long with}} strong thick bills. Some have the {{typically}} undistinguished lark plumage, mainly streaked greyish-brown above and white below, but the, black and <b>white-winged</b> <b>larks</b> have distinctive male plumages. Several species have large black patches on the breast sides.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as for}} bar-headed geese, with up to 125 {{breeding}} pairs {{using the}} site, the reserve was classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of several other bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include Tibetan snowcocks, Himalayan snowcocks, ruddy shelducks, saker falcons, Himalayan vultures, lesser sand plovers, brown-headed gulls, yellow-billed choughs, Hume's <b>larks,</b> <b>white-winged</b> redstarts, white-winged snowfinches, rufous-streaked accentors, brown accentors, black-headed mountain-finches, Caucasian great rosefinches and red-fronted rosefinches.|$|R

50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>lark</b> (Alauda leucoptera) is {{a species}} of lark found from {{southern}} Ukraine through Kazakhstan to south-central Russia. It is partially migratory, with birds tending to move south in winter. The southernmost birds are mainly resident. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.|$|E
40|$|Mlíkovský (2013) {{proposed}} {{replacing the}} widely-used Melanocorypha leucoptera (Pallas, 1811) with Melanocorypha leucoptera (Hablizl, 1785) as the correct {{name for the}} <b>White-winged</b> <b>Lark,</b> with consequent shift in type locality from the Irtyš River-Baraba steppe region in south Siberia to the Crimea. This action breaches Art. 80. 9 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999), hereafter “the Code”. That article states that “no ruling given by the Commission {{in relation to a}} particular work, name, or nomenclatural act is to be set aside without the consent of the Commission”. Melanocorypha leucoptera of Pallas (1811), as published in his Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica, was conserved explicitly in Opinion 403 of the Commission (ICZN 1956), and no consent to Mlíkovský’s findings has been given since. Mlíkovský (2013) argued that Pallas had simply adopted Hablizl’s name without accreditation. Although that is quite possible because Pallas and Hablizl were familiar, the evidence is circumstantial and arguably untenable. According to the information Mlíkovský presents, Alauda leucoptera of Hablizl was published anonymously, is not supported by any traceable specimens, and was never expressly referred to Hablizl by Pallas who did not quote this o...|$|E
