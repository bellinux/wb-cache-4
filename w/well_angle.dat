30|$|Tomren et al. (1986) {{published}} {{the results of}} experimental studies with various drilling fluids in plastic pipe lines with inclination angle from 0 ° to 90 °. They stated that for a constant mud flow rate cutting bed thickness increased by increasing inclination angle. Also, they called the angle between 40 ° and 50 ° as critical angle since cutting bed thickness is formed and cuttings are slipped on the cutting bed in the critical angle. Ford et al. (1990) studied drilling cutting transport in deviated wells. They used a pipe line with 9  ft length, inclination angle from 0 ° to 90 ° and 3.5  in. internal diameter. The results of their work showed that flow regime and rheological properties of the drilling fluid are the key parameters in well cleaning operation and water with turbulence flow has a good performance in well cleaning. Horeland et al. (1993) investigated lime cutting transport in water base mud and invert emulsion oil base mud. They stated that for both muds with same rheological properties, water base mud has a better performance in the wells with 40 °– 50 ° inclination. Okrajni and Azar (1986) examined the effect of mud rheology on the annulus cleaning. The result of their experiments showed that mud rheology properties have a low effect on the cutting transport in turbulence flow, and in laminar flow, cutting transport is done better by increasing mud yield point. Sifferman and Becker (1992) accomplished a set of cutting transport experiments in deviated wells with deviation angle from 45 ° to 90 °. They investigated the effect of various parameters on cutting transport such as drilling fluid velocity, density and rheological properties of mud, mud type, cutting size, ROP, RPM, drill pipe eccentricity, drilling pipe diameter and <b>well</b> <b>angle.</b> Based on their experiments, velocity and mud density are the most effective parameters on the well cleaning. Also, formed drilling cuttings beds make a slop from 45 ° to 60 ° in which they make slippage of cutting on the bed.

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{rectangular}} vectorization method {{which uses}} for auto-forming board {{based on the}} feature analysis on {{a great many of}} shear wall structural design charts is presented. The constructional design drawing was firstly deconstructed into elementary figure unit which contains lines and rectangular angles. These split functional cell were secondly vectorized by restricting straight line so as to reorder and reclassify these essential structural parts. Finally, the components made for the forming board were obtained from the identified cells combined with the shear <b>well</b> <b>angle’s</b> location. This auto-forming board technology has been applied in cast-in-place concrete practices and the results demonstrate that this method and technology can accurately identify complex constructional drawing constitution of building and raise substantially the efficiency of auto-forming board for building construction.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of face mask therapy in {{adolescent}} and young adult female subjects with skeletal Class III malocclusion characterized by maxillary retrognathism. Materials and Methods: The material consisted of pretreatment and posttreatment lateral ceph-alometric radiographs of 28 subjects with Class III malocclusions treated with a face mask. Twen-ty-eight patients age 10 to 16 years were divided into two groups: the adolescent group (15 female patients) and the young adult group (13 female patients). Within group and between group com-parisons were made by paired t-test and Student’s t-test, respectively. Results: Forward displacement of the maxilla and clockwise rotation of the mandible occurred in both the adolescent and young adult groups. Maxillary-mandibular relationship exhibited an in-crease in the ANB angle and Wits appraisal, and the soft-tissue changes resulted in a more convex profile. The maxillary incisors moved forward while the mandibular incisors moved back-ward. Conclusions: Face mask therapy improves skeletal Class III malocclusions by a combination of skeletal and dental changes. Although early treatment may be most effective, face mask treatment can provide a viable option for older children as <b>well.</b> (<b>Angle</b> Orthod. 2009; 79 : 842 – 848.)

40|$|Intelligent well {{completions}} {{are increasingly}} being used in horizontal, multilateral, and multi-branching wells. Such completions are equipped with permanent sensors to measure temperature and pressure profiles, which must then be interpreted to determine the inflow profiles of the various phases produced that are needed to characterize the well??s performance. Distributed temperature measurements, using fiber optics in particular, are becoming increasingly more often applied. The value of an intelligent completion hinges on our capability to extract such inflow profiles or, at a minimum, to locate the entry locations of undesirable water or gas entries. In this research, a model of temperature behavior in multilateral wells was developed. The model predicts the temperature profiles in the build sections connecting the laterals to one another or to a main wellbore, thus accounting for the changing <b>well</b> <b>angle</b> relative to the temperature profile in the earth. In addition, energy balance equations applied at each junction predict the effects of mixing on the temperature above each junction. The multilateral wellbore temperature model was applied {{to a wide range}} of cases, in order to determine the conditions for which intelligent completions would be most useful. Parameters that were varied for this experiment included fluid thermal properties, absolute values of temperature and pressure, geothermal gradients, flow rates from each lateral, and the trajectories of each build section. From this parametric study, guidelines for an optimal application of intelligent well completion are represented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Lac Tio hemo-ilmenite {{ore body}} crops {{out in the}} outer portion of the 1. 06 Ga Lac Allard {{anorthosite}}, {{a member of the}} Havre-Saint-Pierre anorthosite suite from the Grenville province of North America. It is made up of ilmenitite (commonly with more than 95 % hemo-ilmenite) associated with noritic lithologies and anorthosite. The present study compares the magnetic fabric of the ore body, as deduced from anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements, with the crystallographic and shape fabrics, obtained from lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) and shape-preferred orientation (SPO) measurements made using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and 3 D image analysis, respectively. Room-temperature hysteresis measurements, thermomagnetic curves and values of the bulk magnetic susceptibility reveal a magnetic mineralogy dominated by a mixed contribution of hemo-ilmenite and magnetite. The hemo-ilmenite grains display a LPO characterized by a strong preferred orientation of the basal (0001) plane of ilmenite along which hematite was exsolved. This LPO and the magnetic fabric fit <b>well</b> (<b>angle</b> between the crystallographic c-axis and the axis of minimum susceptibility ≤ ca. 15 ° for most samples), and the latter is thus strongly influenced by the hemo-ilmenite magneto-crystalline anisotropy. A magnetite SPO, concordant with the hemo-ilmenite LPO, may also influence and even dominate the magnetic fabric. The rock shape fabric is coaxial with the magnetic fabric that can thus be used to perform detailed structural mapping. Interpretation of the magnetic fabric and field structural data suggests that the Lac Tio ore body would be a sag point at the margin of the Lac Allard anorthosite, deformed by ballooning during the final stage of diapiric emplacement of the anorthosite body...|$|E

This thesis presents three major topics: analysis of pressure transient behavior of horizontal wells, analysis of pressure transient behavior of slanted wells, and performance analysis of wells with lateral and vertical wellbores. Additional analysis of actual well test data is also provided. For horizontal wells, we focus on analysis pressure solution for pseudoradial flow. Limited entry slanted wells are considered in this work by comparing wells with different angles and evaluating the performance. Modeling and performance analysis of a well with lateral and vertical wellbores is the last topic. The specific tasks achieved in this work include the following: We have compared four methods for analyzing pseudoradial flow found in the literature (Odeh and Babu, Joshi, Kuchuk et al., and Lichtenberger) and verified their methods using reservoir simulation. We found that the methods by Kuchuk et al. and Joshi are the most accurate while the method by Lichtenberger has the biggest error. We have modeled and examined the performance of slanted wells with different angles. The well length is equal to formation thickness and is kept constant. It has proven that the performance of slanted wells is proportional to the increase of the well angles only up to 60 ?. Further increasing the <b>well</b> <b>angle</b> will not make the well performance better than a vertical well. We have modeled and analyzed performance of combination wells. We compared the performance of vertical, slanted, and combination wells. Based on that comparison, the combination well has the best performance compared to other well geometries. By having a lateral section beside the vertical section, the performance of the well changes significantly. We have performed an analysis of actual injectivity test data from a well with lateral and vertical wellbores. The proper analysis obtained by correcting the pressure changes confirmed that the semilog straight line shows infinite acting radial flow. The permeability is 62. 3 md, obtained by taking a correct slope of 260 psi/cycle. As of now, the radius of investigation is 8287 ft.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the prospect of}} using Malaysia hematite as weighting material in water-based mud. The discussion is based on laboratory experiments. Currently, in the petroleum industry, barite (commercial name for barium sulphate) is the standard weighting material used to elevate mud weight to a predetermined value. The supply of quality barite may fall short {{in the foreseeable future}} due to the increase in drilling activities and depleting reserves of quality barite. Thus {{there is a need to}} look for and alternative weighting material. In this study, the performance of Malaysia hematite and itâ€™s mixtures with barite were compared to barite, the standard weighting material used in the petroleum industry, in water-based mud. The experimental results revealed that for a given mud density, mud sample with higher percentage of hematite produced higher yield point and gel strength. Nevertheless, it produced little differences in plastic viscosity. The significant advantage realized in utilizing hematite was it gave a lower solid content. The experimental study also revealed that hematite was found to be more abrasive than barite. The abrasiveness rate was found increase proportionally with the <b>well</b> <b>angles</b> (from horizontal). Based on this preliminary study, it is concluded that Malaysia hematite has the potential to be used as weighting material in drilling mud. ...|$|R
