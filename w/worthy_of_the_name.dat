The Second Symphony {{is very different from}} a conventional classical symphony in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations up to that point to build a large-scale, dramatic work <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b> In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, which confirmed his growing international reputation. In 1967 Lutosławski was awarded the Sonning Award, Denmark's highest musical honour.|$|E

25|$|Although High Scawdel stands east of {{the main}} summit, the high ground takes a great loop to the south around the head of Newlands Beck.

Dalehead Tarn is a shallow pool providing a popular stopping place for walkers. Its varied flora include water horsetail, sedge and bogbean. Launchy Tarn is smaller and may have been formed by overgrazing and erosion of the underlying peat.|$|E
25|$|The {{time and}} {{circumstances}} of its final extinction are wholly unknown, but {{the site is}} now desolate, and the whole neighbouring district, once celebrated {{as one of the}} most fertile in Italy, was by the mid-19th century almost wholly uninhabited. The position of the ancient city may nevertheless be clearly identified; and though no ruins <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> are still extant, large heaps of rubbish and foundations of ancient buildings mark the site of Heraclea near Policoro, about 5km from the sea, and a short distance from the right bank of the Aciris. Numerous coins, bronzes, and other relics of antiquity have been discovered on the spot. A medieval town, Anglona, was founded on the site; however, once a bishopric, now itself is but a heap of ruins, among which are those of an 11th-century church.|$|E

It is rather the disillusionment, because no road, sanitary and school infrastructure <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> has emerged. These populations whose main activities are fishing, harvesting and agriculture have seen their area of activity polluted by the different boreholes, making their living conditions unbearable. In addition to the decline in agricultural yields (cassava, yams, plantains) that allow Pointe-Noire to be supplied, water points have also been polluted making water unfit for food use. ENI's only solution is to supply water by tanker trucks whose vats are not always curated. Even this distribution is done at the head of the customer by favoring those who have relationships or money.|$|E

25|$|During {{the reign}} of Elizabeth, Rastrelli, still working to his {{original}} plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale—the present Winter Palace. The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of honour to the Empress, who regarded the palace {{as a symbol of}} national prestige. Work on the building continued throughout the year, even in the severest months of the winter. The deprivation to both the Russian people and the army caused by the ongoing Seven Years' War were not permitted to hinder the progress. 859,555 rubles had been allocated to the project, a sum raised by a tax on state-owned taverns. Though the labourers earned a monthly wage of just one ruble, the cost of the project exceeded the budget, so much so that work ceased due to lack of resources despite the Empress' obsessive desire for rapid completion. Ultimately, taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for the war. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles. By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, a Winter Palace truly <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> was nearing completion.|$|E
25|$|Friction {{intensified}} {{between the}} barons and the king. Henry repudiated the Provisions of Oxford and obtained a papal bull in 1261 exempting {{him from his}} oath. Both sides began to raise armies. Prince Edward, Henry's eldest son, was tempted to side with his godfather Simon de Montfort, and supported holding a Parliament in his father's absence, before he decided to support his father. The barons, under Montfort, captured most of south-eastern England. At the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Henry and Edward were defeated and taken prisoner. Montfort summoned the Great Parliament, regarded as the first English Parliament <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{because it was the}} first time cities and burghs sent representatives. Edward escaped and raised an army. He defeated and killed Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Savage retribution was exacted on the rebels and authority was restored to Henry. Edward, having pacified the realm, left England to join Louis IX on the Ninth Crusade, funded by an unprecedented levy of one-twentieth of every citizen's movable goods and possessions. He was one of the last crusaders in the tradition aiming to recover the Holy Lands. Louis died before Edward's arrival and the result was anticlimactic; Edward's small force limited him to the relief of Acre and a handful of raids. Surviving a murder attempt by an assassin, Edward left for Sicily later in the year, never to return on crusade. The stability of England's political structure was demonstrated when Henry III died and his son succeeded as Edward I; the barons swore allegiance to Edward even though he did not return for two years.|$|E
500|$|After {{four years}} of privately denouncing the popular nature writers in letters and conversation, Roosevelt decided to weigh in publicly; while {{alerting}} Burroughs that he had finally broken his silence, he wrote: [...] "I know that as President I ought not to do this". He had given an interview to journalist Edward B. Clark, who quoted Roosevelt in the article [...] "Roosevelt on the Nature Fakirs" [...] in the June 1907 issue of Everybody's Magazine. Roosevelt not only spoke out against Long, but other authors like Jack London and Roberts, who wrote what he called [...] "'unnatural' history". Roosevelt popularized the term [...] "nature faker" [...] over Clark's original spelling, and defined it in his essay as [...] "an object of derision to every scientist <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name,</b> to every real lover of the wilderness, to every faunal naturalist, to every true hunter or nature lover. But {{it is evident that}} [...] completely deceives many good people who are wholly ignorant of wild life. Sometimes he draws on his own imagination for his fictions; sometimes he gets them second-hand from irresponsible guides or trappers or Indians." [...] He voiced displeasure with and disbelief of London's descriptions of dog fighting in White Fang, as well as Long's stories about Wayeeses the wolf taking down prey; Roosevelt was so specific as to debate the depicted outcome of the fights based {{on the size of the}} animals involved. Long's books in particular were deemed a [...] "genuine crime", especially against the country's children. Fearing that a curriculum including sentimental nature stories would corrupt young children, Roosevelt wrote: [...] "As for the matter of giving these books to children for the purpose of teaching them the facts of natural history—why, it's an outrage." ...|$|E
