25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over me that I would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

"This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting feeling that I had before anybody knew me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is the same feeling I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make you feel that perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss is something I can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss is something I can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus. Carl Williot of Idolator compared the lyrics to the ones of Hall & Oates' [...] "Kiss on My List" [...] (1981).|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{few things}} that is known of Fuzûlî's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the {{introduction}} to his collected Persian poems, he says: [...] "In the early days <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name". Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word fuzûlî—which literally means [...] "impertinent, improper, unnecessary"—because he [...] "knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else". Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning—what is called tevriyye (توريه) in Ottoman Divan poetry—as Fuzûlî himself explains: [...] "I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary fuzûl (ﻓﻀﻮل) is given as a plural of fazl (ﻓﻀﻞ; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as ‘ulûm (ﻋﻠﻮم; 'sciences') and fünûn (ﻓﻨﻮن; 'arts')".|$|E

[...] When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, [...] "There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents." [...] The host then asked about his current research, and the inventor replied, [...] "In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there." ...|$|E

[...] Hamilton stated his mother always made sure he had an instrument around him.

Hamilton has stated, [...] "At first, I was just playing the rhythm of the songs I would hear... The older I got, the more proficient I got at hearing the notes." [...] For most of his life, Hamilton was self-taught. Picking up the lead and bass guitar in his teenage years, as well as the drums and harmonica. Hamilton has stated that listening to other genres of music, being exposed to different cultures and experiencing life helped mold his musical sound. Hamilton would leave from his mother's home at the age of 18 and would at times be homeless spending his nights at his friends houses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{property}} behind Stimson House (on Chester Place) was {{the home}} of Carrie Estelle Doheny, the widow of wealthy oil man, Edward L. Doheny. [...] Mrs. Doheny {{had grown up in}} the neighborhood and had watched as the Stimson House was built. [...] She recalled, [...] "I remember when Mr. Stimson was building this house. [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a little girl, my father would take me for a walk on Sunday afternoons, and we’d always walk this way to see how far along the work had progressed." [...] For eight years from 1940 to 1948, Mrs. Doheny lived behind the fraternity, and the boisterous parties in the house’s dungeon-like [...] "catacombs" [...] were an ongoing source of annoyance. [...] Mrs. Doheny repeatedly complained to the university president, Rufus B. Von Kleinsmid, about disturbances, a former house president recalling that he was called before Kleinsmid [...] "once a month or so" [...] {{as a result of her}} complaints. [...] By 1948, Mrs. Doheny had dealt with the fraternity for long enough and offered $75,000 to purchase the house that the fraternity bought eight years earlier for $20,000. [...] The fraternity house was already struggling with the cost of maintaining the large house and accepted Mrs. Doheny’s offer. [...] After the sale closed, Mrs. Doheny assured herself that she would have no further problems with noisy neighbors by deeding Stimson House to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet for use as a convent. [...] At the time, the Los Angeles Times noted: [...] "The parlor where merry parties reveled at the turn of the century will become a chapel where reverent nuns will now bow in humble devotion.

40|$|The {{moment you}} decide {{sustainability}} {{is an issue}} with respect to interactiondesign and the design of interactive devices is the moment you realize howcomplex the business of deciding what to actually do about it is. It is notjust {{a simple matter of}} calculating the energy and environmental costs ofmanufacturing, use, salvage, and disposal of one technology over another. For example, it was long ago claimed that computing technologies would create a paperless office—a claim that is not yet in sight. Many people print things rather than read on screen—they like to hold paper in their hands and mark things up. Ever since I acquired a portrait mode capable LCD monitor, I have mostly stopped printing things. I can now read and write an entire page of text on my 1200 x 1600 pixel screen at 140 % the size it would <b>be</b> if <b>I</b> printed it. As a result, I almost never print anything anymore. The environmental costs of the energy used to power my display must be weighed against the costs of printing the page <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> reading, assuming that I would actually power-off my display <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> reading what has been printed. Fur-thermore, the environmental cost of production of the portrait mode display and the environmental costs of the premature obsolescence and disposal of the display I had before this one are also part of the equation. Environmental costs are not very static—increasing demands for a technology can drive down some such environmental costs while increasing some others. Nonethe...|$|R
