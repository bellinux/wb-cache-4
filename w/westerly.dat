5|$|The Antarctic Oscillation, {{also known}} as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric {{circulation}} variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the <b>westerly</b> wind belt that circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the <b>westerly</b> wind belt affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. A positive phase is when the <b>westerly</b> wind belt is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger <b>westerly</b> winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less frontal and orographic precipitation resulting from reduced <b>westerly</b> wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the <b>westerly</b> wind belt is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the year, the <b>westerlies</b> vary in {{strength}} with the polar cyclone. [...] As the cyclone reaches its maximum intensity in winter, the <b>westerlies</b> increase {{in strength}}. [...] As the cyclone reaches its weakest intensity in summer, the <b>Westerlies</b> weaken. [...] An {{example of the}} impact of the <b>westerlies</b> is when dust plumes, originating in the Gobi desert combine with pollutants and spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America. [...] The <b>westerlies</b> can be particularly strong, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the progression of west to east winds to slow down. [...] In the Southern hemisphere, because of the stormy and cloudy conditions, it is usual to refer to the <b>westerlies</b> as the roaring forties, furious fifties and shrieking sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude.|$|R

5|$|The {{possibility}} of extending service eastward {{has also been}} considered. Several special trains operated to Mystic during the 2000 OpSail festival, the only such service to date. In a 2001 report examining commuter rail for Rhode Island, RIDOT considered an extension of Shore Line East to Providence via <b>Westerly</b> (effectively restoring the Clamdigger service). Ultimately, MBTA Commuter Rail service, which already ran to Providence {{as part of the}} Providence/Stoughton Line, was extended southward instead (although only to Wickford Junction). However, both RIDOT and SLE have long-term plans to extend their services to meet at <b>Westerly.</b> Extending SLE service would require negotiations with the US Coast Guard, the Marine Trades Association, and other stakeholders for increased use of the Thames River Bridge and the Mystic River bridge. As part of Governor Malloy's thirty year transit plan, Shore Line East would be extended to <b>Westerly</b> at a cost of $200 million. On February 1, 2016, the Connecticut Public Transportation Commission issued a report recommending extension of Shore Line East rail service to Mystic and <b>Westerly</b> as soon as possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{latitudinal}} {{position of}} the southern <b>westerlies</b> has been suggested {{to be a key}} parameter for the climate on Earth. According to the general notion, the southern <b>westerlies</b> were shifted equatorward during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: ~ 24 – 18 ka), resulting in reduced deep ocean ventilation, accumulation of "old dissolved carbon", and low atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. In order to test this notion, we applied surface exposure dating on moraines in the Southern Central Andes, where glacial mass balances are particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation, i. e. to the latitudinal {{position of the}} <b>westerlies.</b> Our results provide robust evidence that the maximum glaciation occurred already at ~ 39 ka, significantly predating the global LGM. This questions the role of the <b>westerlies</b> for atmospheric CO 2 , and it highlights our limited understanding of the forcings of atmospheric circulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} {{and intensity of}} the austral <b>westerlies</b> strongly influence southern hemisphere precipitation and heat transport with consequences for human society and ecosystems. With future warming, global climate models project increased aridity in southern mid-latitudes related to continued poleward contraction of the austral <b>westerlies.</b> We utilize Antarctic ice cores to investigate past and {{to set the stage}} for the prediction of future behaviour of the <b>westerlies.</b> We show that Holocene West Antarctic ice core reconstructions of atmospheric circulation sensitively record naturally forced progressive as well as abrupt changes. We also show that recent poleward migration of the <b>westerlies</b> coincident with increased emission of greenhouse gases and the Antarctic ozone hole has led to unprecedented penetration, compared with > 100, 000 years ago, of air masses bringing warmth, extra-Antarctic source dust and anthropogenic pollutants into West Antarctica. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Declining {{flows in}} Pacific Northwest streams {{have been noted}} by several authors, but the {{causality}} has been unclear, because precipitation data at COOP weather stations {{in the region have}} shown little to no change. Closer examination, however, reveals that COOP stations may not reflect precipitation in the mountains, implying that observed streamflow declines are likely driven by mountain precipitation declines. Decreases in winter <b>westerlies</b> across the region from 1950 - 2012 are hypothesized to have driven these declines, as winter (Nov-Mar) <b>westerlies</b> are strongly correlated to high elevation precipitation but weakly correlated with low elevation precipitation. Climate projections show weakened <b>westerlies</b> across the region under enhanced greenhouse forcing, highlighting an additional stressor relevant for climate change impacts on hydrology...|$|R

40|$|The stable oxygen {{isotope ratio}} (δ 18 O) in {{precipitation}} is an integrated tracer of atmospheric processes worldwide. Since the 1990 s, an intensive {{effort has been}} dedicated to studying precipitation isotopic composition at more than 20 stations in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) located at the convergence of air masses between the <b>westerlies</b> and Indian monsoon. In this paper, we establish a database of precipitation δ 18 O and use different models to evaluate the climatic controls of precipitation δ 18 O over the TP. The spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation δ 18 O and their relationships with temperature and precipitation reveal three distinct domains, respectively associated with {{the influence of the}} <b>westerlies</b> (northern TP), Indian monsoon (southern TP), and transition in between. Precipitation δ 18 O in the monsoon domain experiences an abrupt decrease in May and most depletion in August, attributable to the shifting moisture origin between Bay of Bengal (BOB) and southern Indian Ocean. High-resolution atmospheric models capture the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation δ 18 O and their relationships with moisture transport from the <b>westerlies</b> and Indian monsoon. Only in the <b>westerlies</b> domain are atmospheric models able to represent the relationships between climate and precipitation δ 18 O. More significant temperature effect exists when either the <b>westerlies</b> or Indian monsoon is the sole dominant atmospheric process. The observed and simulated altitude-δ 18 O relationships strongly depend on the season and the domain (Indian monsoon or <b>westerlies).</b> Our results have crucial implications for the interpretation of paleoclimate records and for the application of atmospheric simulations to quantifying paleoclimate and paleo-elevation changes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In boreal winter, {{subtropical}} <b>westerlies</b> in {{the upper}} troposphere reach maxima in speed over the eastern edges of the Asian and North American continents. The zonal variations in the <b>westerlies</b> are generally attributed to large-scale orography and thermal forcing, but the latter mechanism remains largely unsubstantiated. Here we conduct general circulation model (GCM) experiments without orography to identify the most important thermal forcing for generating zonal asymmetries in subtropical <b>westerlies.</b> By changing sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the GCM, {{we find that the}} tropical SST distribution plays a decisive role in producing a subtropical jet core {{to the north of the}} tropical warm water pool, while the effects of extratropical continent-ocean heating contrast on upper-level zonal wind speed distribution are secondary. The results from Aqua Planet runs further support this conclusion. 1...|$|R

The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|R
