On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' father in an animal cage.|$|E

50|$|Empirical {{research}} by economists regarding {{the accuracy of}} the Austrian business cycle theory has generated disparate conclusions, though most research within mainstream economics regarding the theory concludes that the theory is inconsistent <b>with</b> empirical <b>evidence.</b> In 1969, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman found the theory to be inconsistent <b>with</b> empirical <b>evidence.</b> Twenty five years later in 1993, he reanalyzed the question using newer data, and reached the same conclusion. However, in 2001, Austrian economist James P. Keeler argued that the theory is consistent <b>with</b> empirical <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> in {{the fossil record}} that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry also suggests that sometimes the Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater {{public access to}} the acropolis; as the threat of warfare grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> of a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine has ancient roots, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> that, for example, cheese {{has been}} made in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. Ful medames, a stew of fava beans with oil and cumin, is popular in Egypt and has become {{widespread}} across the Arab world. Duqqa is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts and spices, eaten with bread. Kushari is a foreign-derived 19th century dish of rice, lentils and pasta, variously garnished; it began as food for the poor, but has become a national dish.|$|E

Several al-Qaeda members could be identified, but it was {{determined}} that Bin Laden was not in the area. In 2006, Saleh was presented <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> that bin Laden was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles from the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry), and siblings Sara (Jo Armeniox) and Bill (Eric Sheffer Stevens), all say that Nikki was suicidal, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> at the scene suggesting this, but when Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) do an autopsy, the evidence suggests otherwise.

5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for a {{politically}} active citizenry, and populism has been a longstanding force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout (due in part to its liberal voter registration laws) with virtually no evidence of unlawful voting. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2 percent of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus {{the national average of}} 61.2 percent. Previously unregistered voters can register on election day at their polls <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> of residency.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full feathered coat in relatively large dromaeosaurs. Additionally, the animal displays proportionally large, aerodynamic wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurs. Dakotaraptor is an even larger dromaeosaur species <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> of feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill knobs.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists {{are interested in the}} characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what the people who lived there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|E

5|$|Styracosaurus {{and other}} horned dinosaurs are often {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} as herd animals. A bonebed composed of Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, about halfway up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits.
