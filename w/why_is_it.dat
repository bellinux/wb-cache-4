Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps {{important to note that}} this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of her tour of duty Shanina was {{mentioned}} in despatches several times. Her final sniper tally reached fifty-nine confirmed kills (fifty-four, according to other sources), including twelve kills during the Battle of Vilnius, with sixty-two enemies knocked out of action. Domestically her achievements were acknowledged particularly by the war correspondent Ilya Ehrenburg and in the newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, which said that Shanina {{was one of the best}} snipers in her unit and that even veteran soldiers were inferior to her in shooting accuracy. Shanina's exploits were also reported in the Western press, particularly in Canadian newspapers, where she was called [...] "the unseen terror of East Prussia". She paid no special attention to the achieved renown, and once wrote that she had been overrated. On 16 January 1945 Shanina wrote in her combat diary: [...] "What I've actually done? No more than I have to as a Soviet person, having stood up to defend the motherland." [...] She also wrote, [...] "The essence of my happiness is fighting for the happiness of others. It's strange, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that in grammar, the word [...] "happiness" [...] can only be singular? That is counter to its meaning, after all.... If it turns necessary to die for the common happiness, then I'm braced to." ...|$|E

500|$|While Sherwood Smith {{originally}} wrote Crown Duel as {{two separate}} books entitled Crown Duel (1997) and Court Duel (1998), she considered them as [...] "one story." [...] Both novels explore the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, {{the world she}} has been writing about since her youth. Smith grew up wondering why [...] " [...] the way [...] " [...] for instance observing, [...] "Why were the cities so clean, I wondered when I was a kid. I knew about sewers, etc. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> safe to drink from a stream there, and not here?". She conceived Sartorias-deles as a world where, {{over the course of}} several centuries, humans of many different races entered through [...] "worldgates" [...] and were influenced by the culture of its indigenous beings. According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, [...] "basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases and wars, tried to fix things for the humans... Their history is not all happy, it's very strange, and humans still have many human problems, but in other ways they are somewhat different from [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling; rain delayed {{the start of the}} match until midway through the first afternoon. Bradman rested himself and returned to London while Hassett led the team. Yorkshire elected to bat and were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71, despite Australia losing all rounder Sam Loxton with a hamstring injury. Australia replied with 101 without Loxton, who was unable to bat. Hassett came in at 1/24 and was immediately out for a duck. Australia then bowled out the hosts in the second innings for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, Hassett elected to not ask for the pitch to be rolled. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett [...] "might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [...] out of the pitch". Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2/5. Keith Miller was then out at 3/13 after attempting to hit a six, while Hassett was nervous after his first innings duck. Ron Hamence joined Hassett and they took the score to 20 before the former was run out attempting a quick single. Without further addition to the score, Hassett attempted a pull shot and top edged it so high that five players had the time to converge and any of these could have caught the ball. The catch was eventually taken directly in front of Hassett, leaving Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Loxton was still too injured to bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Neil Harvey had scored a solitary run when he was dropped at short leg. Colin McCool fell at 6/31, and Harvey and new partner Don Tallon were both given lives before the tourists scraped home by four wickets. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour, and Hassett was very relieved, playing {{his head in his hands}} and muttering [...] "Why me? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> always me?" [...] in a reference to his encountering rain-affected wickets as captain.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of {{this theory}} {{point out that}} kin {{selection}} {{is not unique to}} humans.

2500|$|<b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that a {{cylindrical}} {{bundle of}} magnetic field lines will not implode, while spherical stars will implode {{under their own}} gravitational force? [...] Thorne tried to explore the theoretical ridge between the two phenomena. [...] He found out eventually that the gravitational force can overcome all interior pressure only when an object has been compressed in all directions. To express this realization, Thorne proposed his hoop conjecture, which describes an imploding star turning into a black hole when the critical circumference of the designed hoop can be placed around it and set into rotation. That is, any object of mass M around which a hoop of circumference [...] can be spun must be a black hole.|$|E

2500|$|The Tannaim {{are much}} {{divided on the}} {{question}} whether Baruch is to be classed among the Prophets.

Joshua served Moses, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him; Elisha served Elijah, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> otherwise with me?" [...] God answered him: [...] "Baruch, of what avail is a hedge where there is no vineyard, or a shepherd where there are no sheep?"

[...] Lindbergh had planned to move to Berlin for the winter of 1938–39. He had provisionally found a house in Wannsee, but after Nazi friends discouraged him from leasing it because it had been formerly owned by Jews, it was recommended that he contact Albert Speer, who said he would build the Lindberghs a house anywhere they wanted.

2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist.

I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!"
