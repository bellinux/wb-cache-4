500|$|On {{the return}} of Overwatchs closed beta in February 2016, victory poses, among other {{elements}} {{were added to the}} characters. In March 2016, a controversy arose over Tracer's [...] "Over the Shoulder" [...] victory pose, after a user opined in the game's forums that it was out of character and that its supposed oversexualization [...] "reduces Tracer to just another bland female sex symbol". The post generated a discussion in the forums, which gaming outlets noted was civil; several users added their dissenting opinions of the pose, while others disagreed with the original poster's thoughts. Kaplan posted an apologetic response in which he announced Blizzard's plans to replace the pose, writing [...] "the last thing <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented". The decision was met with mixed reactions from the gaming community, with some gamers arguing that Blizzard yielded its creative control over the game, censoring its content to appease an offended user, while others praised Blizzard's willingness to listen to the community and adhere to standards for portraying a character according to their personality. Kaplan later expressed that the game's development team was not [...] "entirely happy with the original pose", and had internal creative struggles about its inclusion. The following week, a replacement pose was released, although it was described by one commentator to be [...] "different, butt not by much" [...] referring to the posterior cleavage of the original pose.

2500|$|The {{band members}} grew their hair long and allied {{themselves}} to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period. Many of Holder's costumes during this period, including the trademark mirror top hat, were made by Dorothy [...] "Dolly" [...] Annakin—a sister of Holder's friend Ron Annakin. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing [...] "Coz I Luv You". The song was written {{in half an hour}} and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping was added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furor among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] to number one in the UK charts. In November 1971, NME reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US.
