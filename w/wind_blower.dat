The heat is deliberately created to generate energy, but it will cause excessive heat if it is left unchecked (over heating effect). In order to prevent overheating and keep the machine temperature, then it uses radiator. How effective radiator is used {{can be seen by}} using a tool called a radiator tester. Therefore, this research was Designed a Trial Radiator (Radiator Tester) Laboratory Scale Which is Completed by Round Handler 2 Ì† 7 s Machine and Regulator <b>Wind</b> <b>Blower</b> on Diesel Engine L 300. This research was done by testing the car L 300 diesel in the field then noted rpm and air speed that blew into the radiator. The process of designing a radiator tester L 300 diesel engine laboratory scale were making the framework platform machine, making radiator tester cooling system machine to set up a thermometer in the radiator hose in and out, making a mechanism round handlers machine, making a regulatory mechanism <b>wind</b> <b>blower</b> and installing a trial radiator with round handlers machine and <b>wind</b> <b>blower.</b> The rpm test result and air speed on the field was applied to the radiator tester laboratory scale. From the results of the tests, it showed that there was an increase in value of the effectiveness of the radiator without external airflow to engine speed 1000 rpm and the average value was 0. 483. Whereas, there was a decrease on the effectiveness of the radiator when given outside air flow 2. 3 m / s at 1500 rpm engine speed, which was 0. 63...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} proposed a new general concept of macroscopic quantum-type experiment. It amounts to transform a classical fluid into a quantum-type fluid by {{the application of}} a quantum-like potential, either directly in a stationary configuration, or through a retro-active loop to simulate the time evolution. In this framework, the amplitude of the quantum potential depends on a macroscopic generalization of the Planck constant, which can be changed during the experiment, therefore simulating a quantum to classical transition. The experiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity waves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height, with particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave function with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and the velocity potential as its phase. This wave function is solution of a nonlinear Schrodinger equation typical of superfluids. The quantum potential is therefore defined here in terms of the square root of the fluid height. We suggest two methods for applying this quantum-like potential to the fluid: (i) by the action of a force on the surface (<b>wind,</b> <b>blower,</b> pressure, field, etc [...] .); (ii) by a curvature of the basin ground. In this last case the ground profile yields the quantum potential itself, while usually only the quantum force is accessible, so that such an experiment is expected to provide one with a macroscopic model of a quantum-type vacuum energy. These results may also be relevant to the study of freak waves, which have already been described by nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{performed}} experiments using stationary gas burners and liquid fuel-soaked wicks to study flame geometry and buoyant instabilities important to fundamental wildland fire behaviour has been developed. This thesis focuses on experiments performed with stationary fires to carefully study instabilities observed in spreading fires that suggest {{they play a}} critical role in fire spread. Two types of flow conditions were used to perform experiments similar to wildfire spread conditions: sloped fuel surface and forced-flow (wind aided). Small- scale inclined experiments for performed at the University of Maryland with liquid- fuel soaked wicks and large-scale experiments at the USDA Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory with a gas-burner. These experiments were performed with over a range of heat-release-rates and burner sizes for angles from 0 to 60 degrees from the horizontal. Forced-flow experiments were performed in a large-scale wind tunnel at the Missoula Fire Laboratory and at the University of Maryland with a well characterized <b>wind</b> <b>blower</b> with gas-burners. These experiments were performed for a range of heat-release-rates and burner sizes in wind speeds from 0. 2 to 3. 0 ms&# 8722; 1 The flame geometry was determined using high-speed videography. Important two-dimensional flame geometry parameters such as centerline flame length and flame tilt angle were measured from these images. Flame intermittency and pulsation close to the surface was measured using high-speed videography and micro-thermocouples. A method was developed to track the extension of the flame close to the surface which would come in direct contact with unburnt fuels ahead of the fire. These methods showed that the pul- sation frequency is complicated suggesting large scale structures in the flow. Using these frequency the stationary experiments follow similar Strouhal-Froude scaling for flame pulsations in spreading fires. Stream-wise streaks in the flow were observed and measured using high-speed videography. Streak spacing has been observed to be associated with possible Gotler votice structures in the fire. The spacing for streaks at the base of the flame for these startionary experiments appear to be dependent on the boundary- layer conditions and could possibly scale with the centerline flame length similar to flame towers observed in spreading fires...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the stages}} of post-harvest {{handling}} is drying rice. The rice drying process for this is still done by direct drying under the sun. The drying process depends {{on the amount of}} solar radiation, especially the rainy winter weather. The results showed that the air flow rate and the number of heating pipes are very influential on the energy supplied air to evaporate the water in the grain. Where the highest energy 3. 948. 7353, 979 Watt <b>blower,</b> <b>wind</b> speed 13 m / s with variations of two heating pipes, while the lowest energy 469, 041. 223 Watt <b>blower,</b> <b>wind</b> speed 13 m / s with variations of three heating pipes. The air flow rate and the number of heating pipes also affect the thermal energy which can be used for drying grain. Where the highest energy 85968. 800 Watt at a speed of 13 m / s with variations of three pieces of pipe, while the lowest energy 31426. 867 Watt at a speed of 13 m / s with variations of the pieces of pipe. The efficiency is very dependent on a hot air flow rate and the number of heating pipes, if the energy received high grain, the higher efficiency is obtained. Where the highest efficiency 98. 73 % at a <b>wind</b> speed <b>blower</b> 13 m / s with two heating pipes, while the low efficiency of 2. 81 % at a <b>wind</b> speed <b>blower</b> 7 m / s with a single heating pip...|$|R

40|$|The present {{cross-sectional}} {{study was designed}} to ascertain whether regular and trained <b>wind</b> instrument <b>blowers</b> develop higher pulmonary functions than untrained or part time blowers. The study included 155 trained & regular blowers (Group A), 100 untrained part-time blowers (Group B) and 100 non-blowers (Group C). They were investigated by a computerized spirometer (RMS medspiror). Group A subjects showed a significantly higher (p< 0. 001) percentage predicted value for Forced Vital capacity (FVC), Forced expiratory volume in the 1 st second (FEV 1), Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR), Maximum Voluntary Ventilation(MVV), Forced Expiratory Flow at 25 % & 50 % of FVC (FEF 25 % & FEF 50 %), Forced Expiratory Flow between 25 % & 75 %of FVC (FEF 25 - 75 %), FEF 50 % of FVC, than the other two groups.

40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} {{of all three}} mean velocity components and {{five of the six}} Reynolds stresses have been made around a model of a lifting-wing/body junction. The body was the flat working section floor of a small <b>blower</b> <b>wind</b> tunnel. Measurements of the surface pressure distribution on the NACA 0012 wing showed that the lift coefficient at the body surface was reduced by only 16 percent from the freestream value. It is shown that the near constancy of the bound vorticity requires the formation of aixal vorticity within the body boundary layer. This vorticity was concentrated in the two legs of the necklace vortex formed near {{the leading edge of the}} wing. The magnitude of the vorticity was always greater in the leg that developed on the suction surface. By four chord lengths downstream of the trailing edge, the turbulence structure of the suction leg was qualitatively similar to that of a single vortex imbedded in a turbulent boundary layer...|$|R

Furthermore, the safe evacuation of occupants during such a catastrophe is of utmost importance. This research entails a comprehensive means to address such scenarios, through both the sensing and control of contaminants, and the modeling of and potential communication to occupants as they evacuate. First, a computational fluid dynamics model has been developed that is capable of detecting and mitigating the hazardous contaminant over several time horizons using model predictive control optimization. Next, an evacuation agent-based model has been designed and coupled with the flow control model to simulate agents evacuating while interacting with a dynamic, threatening environment. Finally, a physical prototype (<b>blower</b> <b>wind</b> tunnel) has been constructed with capability of detection (via Ethernet-connected camera) of and mitigation (via compressed-air operated actuators) of a `contaminant' (i. e. smoke) to test the real-time feasibility of the computational fluid dynamics flow control model...|$|R
