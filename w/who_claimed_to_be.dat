5|$|Anna Anderson (16 December 1896– 12 February 1984) was {{the best}} known of several impostors <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia. Anastasia, the {{youngest}} daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was killed along with her parents and siblings on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia; but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of Spanish–Italian–Sicilian ancestry, {{composed}} various {{pieces that}} reflect an enthusiasm for those cultures, such as Fantasia ispanica, Rosario d'arabeschi and Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach. These are works of a Mediterranean character and {{are inspired by}} Busoni's Elegy No. 2, All'Italia, and the Spanish music of Isaac Albéniz, Debussy, Enrique Granados and Liszt. They are considered among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Reyes was {{contacted}} by Doggett, now an FBI agent assigned to X-Files department, {{to assist in}} on a case involving the disappearances of several individuals <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alien abductees, {{as well as the}} disappearance of fellow agent Fox Mulder. Because of her background, Reyes considered that these believers may have simply formed a cult, but did not rule out the possibility of alien intervention. She stayed with the case until after Mulder was returned by his abductors, but returned to her field office soon after.|$|E
5|$|Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal {{searched for}} Wallenberg and {{collected}} several testimonies. For example, British businessman Greville Wynne, who was imprisoned in the Lubyanka prison in 1962 for his connection to KGB defector Oleg Penkovsky, {{stated that he}} had talked to, but {{could not see the}} face of, a man <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Swedish diplomat. Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on Wrangel Island in 1962. An eyewitness asserted that she had seen Wallenberg in the 1960s in a Soviet prison.|$|E
5|$|Olga escaped revolutionary Russia {{with her}} second husband and their two sons in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In exile, Olga acted as {{companion}} and secretary to her mother, and was often sought out by Romanov impostors <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> her dead relatives. She met Anna Anderson, the best-known impostor, in Berlin in 1925. After the Dowager Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in Ballerup, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working on the farm and painting. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided extra income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Jaffna kingdom is obscure and still the subject of {{controversy}} among historians. Among mainstream historians, such as K. M. de Silva, S. Pathmanathan and Karthigesu Indrapala, the widely accepted {{view is that the}} Kingdom of the Aryacakravarti dynasty in Jaffna began in 1215 with the invasion of a previously unknown chieftain called Magha, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> from Kalinga in modern India. He deposed the ruling Parakrama Pandyan II, a foreigner from the Pandyan Dynasty who was ruling the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa at the time {{with the help of his}} soldiers and mercenaries from the Kalinga, modern Kerala and Damila (Tamil Nadu) regions in India.|$|E
5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized {{the books of}} the cathedral library, taking them to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part {{of it as a}} stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E

5|$|In Armenia, the {{strategically}} important city of Theodosiopolis (Erzurum) surrendered in 609 or 610 to Ashtat Yeztayar, {{because of}} the persuasion of a man <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Theodosius, the eldest son and co-emperor of Maurice, who had supposedly fled {{to the protection of}} Khosrow. In 608, the Persians launched a raid into Anatolia that reached Chalcedon, across the Bosphorus from Constantinople. The Persian conquest was a gradual process; by the time of Heraclius' accession the Persians had conquered all Roman cities east of the Euphrates and in Armenia before moving on to Cappadocia, where their general Shahin took Caesarea. There, Phocas' son-in-law Priscus, who had encouraged Heraclius and his father to rebel, started a year-long siege to trap them inside the city.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1997, a {{delegation}} of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, Robert Bropho, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation {{was to have been}} larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Grant Morrison later {{chose to}} heavily reimagine Kathy Kane in 2011 for his Batman Incorporated series. It is {{established}} that Kathy Kane was born Katherine Webb, {{and that she}} had been an aspiring independent film director prior to marrying a millionaire named Nathan Kane, the son of Roderick and Elizabeth Kane and brother of Martha (Kane) Wayne, Bruce Wayne's mother. Nathan and Kathy were madly in love with one another, and it was Nathan who ended up buying Kathy her circus as a birthday present. After Nathan's untimely death, Kathy was approached by a young man known only as Agent-33, who recruited her into a covert spy organization called Spyral. As part of her first assignment, Kathy was tasked with tracking down Batman and discovering his true identity. Donning a female variation of Batman's costume in order to gain his attention, she embarked on a career as a costumed crime-fighter while attempting to get close to Batman. Her plan succeeded but the two fell in love with one another, despite Kathy legally being Wayne's aunt. As a result, she refused to reveal his identity to her superiors at Spyral. Later, Kathy was confronted by the head of Spyral, a Nazi supervillain named Dr. Dedalus (Otto Netz) <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> her real father and threatened to expose her to Batman unless she continued her mission. Heartbroken, she broke off her relationship with Bruce in order to save him from Dedalus' plan. In the present, Batman and the South American vigilante El Gaucho are told by the villainess Scorpiana that El Gaucho was responsible for Kathy's murder, as he had originally been Agent-33 prior to becoming a superhero. Batman tells Gaucho that Scorpiana must be lying since Kathy had been killed by the League of Assassins, but Gaucho claims that there is some truth in her accusations, and that Batman wouldn't understand. In the follow-up one-shot Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes, students of an assassin training facility masquerading as St. Hadrian's Finishing School For Girls in England are shown wearing variations of Kathy's Batwoman costume, with the original masks replaced by skulls. Later, these women are shown to be agents of Spyral, dedicated to hunting down Talia al Ghul, whose organisation Leviathan is waging war with Batman. Kathy reappears alive in the concluding issue of Batman Incorporated, in which she shoots Talia al Ghul dead in the Batcave. Identifying herself as St Hadrian's headmistress and requesting Batman not to go looking for her, she thanks Batman for leading Talia into her trap and reports to Spyral headquarters that one more international criminal has been killed.|$|E

Also around this time, she became highly impressed with a group of mystic individuals—the hermit Wei Shifang (on whom she bestowed a chancellor title briefly), <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more than 350years old; an old Buddhist nun <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Buddha and capable of predicting the future; and a non-Han man <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 500years old.
