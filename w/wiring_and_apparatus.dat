40|$|Objective - {{to study}} the effect of tunnelization <b>and</b> <b>apparatus</b> hip {{decompression}} {{on the state of}} proximal femur growing plate. Material and methods. A pattern of changes in proximal femur growing plate of the affected and intact extremities was investigated in 46 children with III degree Perthes disease. The follow-up was 3 years. To unload the affected joint, an external fixator (most often, the Ilizarov apparatus) was placed on pelvic and femoral bones, which was used in a mode of non-articulating arthrodiastasis. The measurements of width of proximal femur growing zone were performed on pelvic bones rentgenograms in anteroposterior projection with internal hip rotation achieved with 1 meter focal length and their subsequent transfer to a digital format. Results. In the study group <b>wire</b> tunneling <b>and</b> <b>apparatus</b> fixation were shown not to result in growing plate locking, providing conditions for recovery of the shape and structure of the femoral head, which was accompanied by a slowdown in its width decrease in the affected extremity and led to the compliance of this parameter between the intact and affected extremities. No correlation was revealed between the degree of structural metaphyseal damage and the state of proximal growing zone...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a melhor técnica de ancoragem entre alvenaria-estrutura, avaliando sua eficiência no combate a esse tipo de fissura. Foram utilizados para a elaboração dos ensaios, além dos materiais usados na alvenaria de vedação (bloco cerâmico, argamassa etc), diferentes materiais de ancoragem (tela metálica eletrosoldada e barras de aço) e dispositivos de ligação (adesivo epóxi, pinos, arruelas e cantoneira), analisando-se assim o melhor conjunto do ponto de vista técnico. Foram feitos ensaios de caracterização dos materiais e de arrancamento à tração direta, até a ocorrência da primeira fissura visível a olho nu. Concluiu-se finalmente que a tela metálica eletrosoldada galvanizada malha 15 x 15 mm e diâmetro do fio 1, 65 mm, sem cantoneira e com tratamento de chapisco com adesivo acrílico no pilarete foi a melhor técnica de ancoragem para a prevenção do aparecimento de fissuras na interface alvenaria de vedação e pilar de concretoAbstract: The splitting of the fair-faced masonry-structure {{are very}} usual {{but it is}} not wellknown the reason of its occurrence, although they are frequent, specially the ones that appear in the linking of the masonry-concrete column. The purpouse of this work was to study the best anchorage technique between masonrystructure, being evaluated its efficiency to prevent this type of splitting. Beyond the materials that are usually used for masonry (ceramic block, mortar etc), changeable materials of anchorage (stell welded tie <b>and</b> steel <b>wire)</b> <b>and</b> <b>apparatus</b> of linking (adhesive epoxy, bolts, washers and angle-steel) were used, analyzing the best combination for the technical view. Tests of characterization of the materials and the pullout test were made, until the occurrence of the first splitting visible by naked eye. Finally, it was concluded that the metallic wall tie, 15 x 15 mm and the diameter of wire 1, 65 mm, without angle-steel and with mortar with acrylic adhesive in the concrete column was the best anchorage technique for to prevent occurrence of splitting in the fair-faced masonry-concrete structur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives some}} {{quantitative}} measurements of wind tunnel turbulence {{and its effect}} on the air resistance of spheres and airship models, measurements made possible by the hot <b>wire</b> anemometer <b>and</b> associated <b>apparatus</b> in its original form was described in Technical Report no. 320 and some modifications are presented in an appendix to the present paper. One important result of the investigation is a curve by means of which measurements of the air resistance of spheres can be interpreted to give the turbulence quantitatively. Another is the definite proof that the discrepancies in the results on the N. P. L. Standard airship models are due mainly to differences in the turbulences of the wind tunnels in which the tests were made. An attempt is made to interpret the observed results in terms of the boundary layer theory and for this purpose a brief account is given of the physical bases of this theory and of conceptions that have been obtained by analogy with the laws of flow in pipes...|$|R
40|$|On September 30 th, 1977, the Supreme Court of Canada has {{delivered}} a judgment {{in the case}} of Cablevision (Montreal) Inc. v. Le Sous-ministre du Revenu de la province de Québec, where the fundamental problem of the qualification of things has once more been reviewed. In this instance, the Court had to qualify a network of <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> various <b>apparatus</b> belonging to the appellant and fixed, under a lease, by this corporation to poles being the property of the Bell Telephone Co. and the Hydro-Québec Corporation, as well as an antenna, also belonging to Cablevision, fixed to the roof of the Montreal skyscraper Place Ville-Marie, the property again of a third party. All these things, formerly moveables, have been held by the Supreme Court to have become immoveable by nature, due to their close attachment to the buildings to which they were affixed. This judgment will have to be distinguished from the former leading case of Nadeau v. Rousseau which held that the incorporated moveable had {{to become part of the}} building itself or be indispensable to its natural use. Since a TV antenna fixed to a building is not an essential part ofthat building nor even useful to it, the Court must fall back on the test of close attachment in order to determine its character. The writer of this paper feels this decision is sound reasoning, and recalls the true nature and origins of property immoveable by its nature. Since only land is a real immoveable by nature, buildings are held so only because of their attachment to the land. Again, things immoveable by their destination are held to be so mainly because of their close relationship to the building. The test of physical attachment is then the only true objective test to qualify moveable things when affixed to an immoveable...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} new experimental {{measurements of}} the thermal conductivity of oxygen for thirteen isotherms at temperatures from 78 to 310 K with pressures to 70 MPa and densities from 0 to 40 mol/L. The measurements were made with a transient hot <b>wire</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>and</b> they cover {{a wide range of}} physical states including the dilute gas, the moderately dense gas, the near critical region, the compressed liquid states, and the vapor at temperatures below the critical temperature. The thermal conductivity surface is represented with an equation that is based in part on an existing correlation of the dilute gas. The date are compared with the experimental measurements of others through the new correlation. The new measurements show that the critical enhancement extends to quite high temperatures, about 300 K. The precision (2 sigma) of the oxygen of the oxygen measurements is between 0. 5 and 0. 8 percent for wire temperature transients of 4 to 5 K, while the accuracy is estimated to be 1. 5 percent...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic {{longitudinal}} displacements, {{delivered to}} the distal tips of small diameter wire waveguides, {{have been shown to}} be capable of disrupting complicated atherosclerotic plaques during vascular interventions. These ultrasonic displacements can disrupt plaques by direct contact ablation but also by pressure waves, associated cavitation and acoustic streaming developed in the surrounding blood and tissue cavities. The pressure waves developed within the arterial lumen appear to play a major role but are complex to predict as they are determined by the distal tip output of the wire waveguide (both displacement and frequency), the geometric features of the waveguide tip and the effects of biological fluid interactions. This work describes a numerical linear acoustic fluid-structure model of an ultrasonic <b>wire</b> waveguide <b>and</b> the blood surrounding the distal-tip. The model predicts a standing wave structure in the wire waveguide, including the stresses and the displacements, with the inclusion of a validated damping constant. The effects of including an enlarged ball-tip at the distal end of the waveguide, designed to enhance cavitation and surface contact area, are investigated, in addition to the effects of the surrounding blood on the resonant response of the waveguide. The model predicts the pressures developed in the acoustic fluid field surrounding the ultrasonic vibrating waveguide tip and can predict the combinations of displacements, frequencies and waveguide geometries required to cause cavitation, an important event in the disruption of plaque. The model has been validated against experimental displacement measurements with a purpose built 23. 5 kHz nickel titanium <b>wire</b> waveguide <b>apparatus</b> <b>and</b> against experimental pressure measurements from the literature...|$|R

40|$|Background. Any {{decrease}} in friction between orthodontic <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> bracket can accelerate tooth {{movement in the}} sliding technique and result in better control of anchorage. This study was carried out to evaluate frictional forces by coating orthodontic <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> porcelain brackets with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO). Methods. In this in vitro study, we evaluated a combination of 120 samples of 0. 019 × 0. 025 stainless steel (SS) orthodontic <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> 22 mil system edgewise porcelain brackets with and without spherical zinc oxide nanoparticles. Spherical ZnO nanoparticles were deposited on <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> brackets by immersing them in ethanol solution and SEM (scanning electron microscope) evaluation confirmed {{the presence of the}} ZnO coating. The frictional forces were calculated between the <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> brackets in four groups: group ZZ (coated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> bracket), group OO (uncoated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> bracket), group ZO (coated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> uncoated bracket) and group OZ (uncoated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> coated bracket). Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for data analysis. Results. The frictional force in ZZ (3. 07 ± 0. 4 N) was the highest (P < 0. 05), and OZ (2. 18 ± 0. 5 N) had the lowest amount of friction (P < 0. 05) among the groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} frictional forces between the ZO and OO groups (2. 65 ± 0. 2 and 2. 70 ± 0. 2 N, respectively). Conclusion.
