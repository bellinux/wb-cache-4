25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to put her to bed.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} over Andrew Lincoln's performance. Despite citing {{that his}} accent was [...] "dodgy", Pierce lauded Lincoln's acting. [...] "his body language and expression here is totally different now than <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> him before," [...] he opined. [...] "He's a fast learner." [...] Gilbert {{referred to his}} accent as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process what he is seeing. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E

On her blog, Kim Kardashian wrote that the family found the episode very funny and were honored to be featured in the episode. She wrote, [...] "We were all dying <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> this clip from South Park that aired last night... literally, LOL. They killed us all!!!" [...] She also wrote, [...] "I managed to survive the longest... of course!" [...] Kourtney Kardashian joked on her Twitter page, [...] "How rude! Southpark!!", Khloé Kardashian wrote {{she did not know}} about her appearance on the show until she suddenly received numerous messages on her Twitter page. Khloé also said she found the scene funny, and laughed at how unattractively she and her sisters were portrayed, although she said the Bruce Jenner cartoon looked very realistic. She wrote, [...] "Even though we all weren't portrayed as the most attractive South Park characters, I was still so flattered since I love that show haha." ...|$|E

500|$|Several gaming and {{technology}} sites reported an [...] "overheating bug" [...] with StarCraft II {{that in some}} cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards. The source of the problem {{is the fact that the}} frame rate is not locked on menu screens. This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image, resulting in excessive heat. Blizzard has acknowledged the problem, and posted a temporary workaround. [...] They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the videocard manufacturer for hardware-related issues. In response to the reports, Blizzard's Public Relations Manager, Bob Colayco said: [...] "There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> this issue first reported, we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem, the cause is most likely hardware-related." [...] CrunchGear has also suggested that the problem is not with StarCraft II, but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling. They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non-framerate locked screens and provide the fix that Blizzard has offered to users. [...] Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the cooling efficiency of their systems. Blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding the issue that has since been removed. The message was: [...] "Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient. This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{news of the}} landsknechts' defeat reached Cardona's {{troops at}} about the same time that it had reached Enghien; the Imperial column turned and retreated back towards its {{original}} position. Enghien followed closely with the remainder of his cavalry; he was soon reinforced by a company of Italian mounted arquebusiers, which had been stationed at Racconigi and had started towards the battlefield after hearing the initial artillery exchange. These arquebusiers, dismounting to fire and then remounting, were able to harass the Imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat. Meanwhile, the French and Swiss infantry of the center, having reached Ceresole, had turned about and returned to the battlefield; Montluc, who was with them, writes: When we heard at Ceresole that M. d'Enghien wanted us, both the Swiss and we Gascons turned toward him—I never saw two battalions form up so quick—we got into rank again actually as we ran along, side by side. [...] The enemy was going off at quick march, firing salvos of arquebuses, and keeping off our horse, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> them. [...] And when they descried us only 400 paces away, and our cavalry making ready to charge, they threw down their pikes and surrendered to the horsemen. You might see fifteen or twenty of them round a man-at-arms, pressing about him and asking for quarter, for fear of us of the infantry, who were wanting to cut all their throats. Perhaps as many as half of the Imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender; the remainder, about 3,150 men, were taken prisoner. A few, including the Baron of Seisneck, who had commanded the German infantry contingents, managed to escape.|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with Billboard, Carey {{revealed}} that she wrote [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] while her husband, Nick Cannon, was hospitalized receiving medical treatment for mild kidney failure, saying [...] "There's a lot of things you can take from there that can keep you going in a tough situation." [...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened? It saddened Carey that R and hip-hop music was being [...] "bowled over" [...] by dance music, and therefore wanted to remain true to herself by making traditional R music: ...|$|E

2500|$|On top of {{his grief}} for his family and friends, Zubeidi was greatly embittered {{by the fact that}} none of the Israelis who had {{accepted}} his mother's hospitality, and whom he had thought were his friends, tried to contact him. In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, [...] "You took our house and our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and what did we get in return? A bullet in my mother’s chest. We opened our home and you demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come to do theatre there. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone.

Calling Madonna [...] "provocative and sexy", he writes: [...] "Madonna has substantiated her claim to the title of [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] and that [...] "she surprised her enthusiastic audience erotically and provocatively." [...] He also noted that [...] "she dominates even after 30 years on stage." [...] Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph assessed the concert, assigning it 4 out of 5 stars, and wrote, [...] "he real highlight of this show was a stripped back version of 'Like a Virgin'... Madonna proved herself more than equal to be challenge of all her young pretenders". Kat Keogh from Birmingham Mail gave {{a positive}} review at the performance in Birmingham. Giving the performance 4 out of 5 stars, she reveals: [...] "Thousands of fans gave a regal welcome as her Madgesty took the stage", that [...] "the pure theatre of her performance was enough to sustain the 11,000 strong audience" [...] and [...] "the feel good classics proved why the 53 year old is the original and the best." [...] Madonna's performance in Edinburgh also received generally positive reviews. Beverley Lyons from Daily Record stated: [...] "Madonna's still in Vogue with fans" [...] and [...] "this was a remarkable show– and a night <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> a softer side to the Queen of Pop." ...|$|E

Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> it, too, and it's a choice that was made.
