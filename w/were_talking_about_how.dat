5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> you sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; {{so they decided to}} produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

50|$|Edman {{spent his}} early years at the Institute {{designing}} and producing a machine that automated protein sequencing. In 1958 RMIT graduate Geoffrey Begg was employed as a junior laboratory assistant to Edman and became intimately involved in the project.

I was only a laboratory assistant and they all laughed, so I forgot about it. But apparently Dr Edman had been thinking about the same thing. He heard about this and asked me if I could make a model of a possible machine.” The next day, Begg brought an electric motor from home and aided by his glass blowing skills, showed that the idea was feasible. Begg spent much of the following year working on the machine, which {{came to be known as}} ‘Matilda’.|$|E

5000|$|... "Love You Better" [...] is from Oh Land's third studio album, Wish Bone (2013). The {{album was}} {{released}} on 16 September 2013 by Tusk or Tooth Records and A:larm Music. The song was written and produced by Oh Land, with David Poe serving as an additional songwriter. Poe played his guitar on the track and Danny Cheung served as the track's sole engineer. According to the singer, [...] "it is a song {{that means a lot}} to her" [...] because it serves as a [...] "delicate, melancholy ode to wisdom and age". Oh Land spoke regarding the song's meaning and inspiration:It was written in the L.A. sun on an afternoon with my friend David Poe. We <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> you sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.The song itself was recorded at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. In an interview with Noisey, Oh Land spoke with Kim Taylor Bennett who asked her for further clarification on the lyrics. Bennett interpreted the lyrics as a [...] "girl who is perhaps incapable of love and commitment" [...] {{but by the end of}} the song, it is revealed that [...] "it's the guy who is the asshole", to which Oh Land confirmed and said, [...] "Yeah, so it's like, 'fuck you!'". She also described it as a song that [...] "fast-forwards a bit" [...] and inspires her because she believes that she [...] "will do everything better when she gets older". Oh Land discusses loving someone to a deeper extent as she ages: [...] "I will wrap my arms around you and keep you from the cold / I will love you better when I'm old". Several music critics described [...] "Love You Better" [...] as a ballad. The Guardians Paul MacInnes called the song an [...] "acoustic ballad", while Leonie Cooper from NME felt it was a [...] "folk ballad".|$|E
