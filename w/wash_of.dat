5|$|The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on {{the terrace}} {{overlooking}} the Great Bath are particularly susceptible {{to the effect of}} acid rain and are being protected with a <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> a sacrificial shelter coat every few years. Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{took for}} granted {{that all of the}} layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E

25|$|In {{peripheral}} regions, even cruder counterfeits might pass: in the Viking-age site in Coppergate, Coppergate, York, a forgery of an Arab dirham was found, struck {{as if for}} Isma'il ibn Achmad (ruling at Samarkand, 903-07/8), {{of copper}} covered by a once-silvery <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> tin.|$|E
25|$|The fast ferries were {{intended}} to achieve crossing times that were 30 minutes faster than those of conventional ferries, making twelve crossings per day rather than eight. Although they initially achieved this crossing time, complaints of the <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> the ships wake forced the ferries to take a longer route, and operate a slower speed around Bowen Island. An archived version of BC Ferries website states that a PacifiCat sailing was only 15 minutes shorter than a sailing with a regular vessel.|$|E

On 15 July, he took his 200th wicket of his ODI career by taking wicket of Hashim Amla in the final ODI of the series. He also became the 8th and youngest ODI cricketer to take 200 wickets and score 4000 runs.|$|E

25|$|The {{subject of}} the {{controversy}} was a drawing by Steinberg known as View of the World from 9th Avenue or A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World. The drawing, which appeared {{on the cover of}} the March 29, 1976 issue of The New Yorker, depicts four city blocks of Manhattan in great detail, with the rest of the United States and the world sketched sparsely in the background. The horizon is marked by a red line, and a thin blue <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> color at the top denotes the sky. At the top is the name of the magazine, in its characteristic font.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{entrance is}} through the tower archway {{by way of a}} large, semi-circular arch that is decorated by rubbed brick and am impost three bricks high {{at the lower end of}} the arch. The arch itself consists of voussoirs with plastered over, white bricks forming the interior of the arch. Above the arch is a primitive, triangular tympanum the lower line of which extends beyond the raked borders. It is embellished by a fascia on the outer course with a fillet and ovolo on the inner course. It was alternately decorated with white cement, a marble tablet, and now a <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> mortar.|$|E
500|$|However, Rolling Stone {{described}} the album as [...] "too often a monochromatic dirge of banal existential imagery cloaked around the mere {{skeleton of a}} musical idea". Saying that the album had some nifty choruses and nice atmospheres, the review {{went on to say}} it [...] "evinces too little melodic development and too much tortured soul-gazing". In his 1984 review for NME, Biba Kopf said, [...] "... Ocean Rain has been designed to buttress the notion of the group's importance. Not unnaturally the results have the opposite effect." [...] He went on to criticise McCulloch's lyrics, which he described as [...] "tired juxtapositions of mysterious buzzwords, nonsense, and banality", and the music, [...] "mellotron-style <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> strings and bleating wood winds".|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the final}} chorus section, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] {{features}} a song-spanning dynamic after the bridge and guitar break that is accompanied by minor Rhodes piano and guitar chords, while the multi-tracked vocals are implemented as background whispers. Arrangements for the song are stripped back for an emphasis on vocals, leading to an enormous choral climax accompanied by overdriven electric guitar. On the song's final chorus section, critic Steve McPherson wrote [...] "after it hits a peak, it keeps rising, the chorus of voices fizzing into overdrive and the whole track gradually succumbing to a <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> reverb". The song is cut off {{in the middle of}} its culmination, ending with the line [...] "How does it fee-".|$|E
500|$|In some instances, {{the colour}} {{combinations}} look garish: {{this is particularly}} {{the case with the}} Prophet Daniel. A comparison of the [...] "restored" [...] and [...] "unrestored" [...] figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned. The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as they still are on the Cumaean Sibyl. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both oil painting and tempera. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.|$|E
500|$|The album {{version of}} the track does not have drum accompaniment and portrays an ambient song. It does not have Homogenics {{characteristic}} electronic beats, focusing instead on [...] " [...] an intimacy between the growing dynamics of the instrumentation and Bjork's impressive vocal abilities." [...] It uses a long reverb, which results in a <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> sound that suggests a very large space suggestive of the [...] "heavenly" [...] environment envisaged by the singer for the track. According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the song has a soft pulse with intervals that build up to an electronic orchestration of industrial beats. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "moony lullaby" [...] and compared it {{to the music of}} Enya. In his review for Spin, James Hunter wrote that the track is one of the times Björk [...] "dips her toe into the warm lake of tradition" [...] and noted its [...] "rockish minor-key verses traipse off into her gospel." ...|$|E

The remaining undeveloped areas, known as the East Kolkata Wetlands, were designated a [...] "wetland of international importance" [...] by the Ramsar Convention (1975).

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a <b>wash</b> <b>of</b> shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds just too much of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will remind you of other, much better songs, but in a way that only makes you want to go and listen to those other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E
