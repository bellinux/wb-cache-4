25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} are locomotives with a {{steam engine}} that provides adhesion. Coal, petroleum, or wood is burned in a firebox, boiling {{water in the}} boiler to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the smokebox before leaving via the chimney or smoke stack. In the process, it powers a piston that transmits power directly through a connecting rod (US: main rod) and a crankpin (US: <b>wristpin)</b> on the driving wheel (US main driver) or to a crank on a driving axle. Steam locomotives have been phased out {{in most parts of}} the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by heritage railways.|$|E
2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a crankpin (<b>Wristpin</b> in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled {{through a set of}} rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, adjusting valve travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile â€“ maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|E

50|$|The 303 CID L engine had {{hydraulic}} lifters, an oversquare bore:stroke ratio, a counterweighted forged crankshaft, aluminum pistons, floating <b>wristpins,</b> and a dual-plane intake manifold. The 303 {{was produced}} from 1949-1953. Bore was 3.75 in and stroke was 3.4375 in. Cadillac used a distantly related engine {{which appeared in}} three different sizes through to the 1962 model year; though the Oldsmobile and Cadillac motors were not physically related, many lessons learned by one division were incorporated into the others design, and the result were two engines known for their excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy, and smooth, strong, reliable running.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the frictional behavior of a roller crosshead configuration is given. This configuration consists of a piston which carries at the <b>wristpin</b> position a roller of large diameter which can roll on the cylinder liner surfaces. A preliminary assessment is given of whether the roller can roll on the cylinder liner without skidding, and what, if any, are the tribological implications of this approach to a dry lubricated design. The rotational speed of the roller must change during the stroke {{if it is not}} to slip on the cylinder liner. The maximum value of angular acceleration occurs at top dead center and bottom dead center. If the traction force {{on the rim of the}} roller, which is the product of the normal force due to piston side load and the coefficient of friction, is not sufficient to drive the roller through the necessary angular acceleration, sliding will occur. At 1, 000 rpm, it appears that there will be a definite area of slip near each end of the stroke. The length of the area of slip may be of the order of 1 / 8 inch at each of these points...|$|E
