25|$|Timpani are {{typically}} struck {{with a special}} type of drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from hardwood or bamboo but may also be made from aluminum or carbon fiber. The head can be constructed {{from a number of}} different materials, though felt wrapped around a wooden core is the most common. Other core materials include compressed felt, cork, and leather, and other <b>wrap</b> <b>materials</b> include chamois. Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common. Wooden sticks are used as a special effect—specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era—and in authentic performances of Baroque music.|$|E
40|$|Some seven {{different}} configurations of the NSI and other cables {{were tested in}} the NASA-MSFC Hot Gas Facility (HGF). The tests were conducted to study {{what happens to the}} cables when they are exposed to hot flow {{as was the case in}} the first two Shuttle flights, the STS- 1 and STS- 2. Protection of these components is vital for various functions especially to attain proper nozzle separation. The tests in the HGF demonstrated the severity of the aerodynamic forces combined with aero heating environment on the test cables and helped, in general, to evaluate the cable <b>wrap</b> <b>materials</b> and cable mounting hardware and technique. Blastape 2 cable wrap which is adequate for thermal protection of the cables must be properly clamped at its ends. The nylon clamps (or ties) used to secure cables to metal components inside the skirt could not withstand the heating.

40|$|Filament wound {{advanced}} composite materials {{are used to}} produce a self induced lateral confinement of cylindrical Pyrex glass and Macor machinable glass ceramic specimens. The confining stress is {{shown to be a}} result of the composite wrap restricting the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s expansion of the core when it is placed under an applied axial load. The lateral stress is therefore found to maintain a constant ratio to the axial stress, or a constant biaxiality ratio, for an elastic core material. These specimens are subjected to both quasi-static and dynamic high strain rate loading in order to measure the change in strength of the base material {{as a function of the}} confining stress. The experimental results are used to demonstrate the potential performance and weight savings of this confinement technique over traditional mechanical or heat shrink methods. An analysis is performed to identify the role of key core and wrap parameters that determine the ultimate strength of brittle materials confined in this fashion and to identify an accurate means of estimating the confined state of stress. The Mohr-Coulomb criterion is evaluated as a possible option for modeling the observed strength but is shown to have some deficiencies in reproducing portions of the experimental data. A fracture mechanics based model is then presented which empirically relates the observed ultimate strength data to the estimated confining stress. This model is shown to accurately reproduce the confined strength data for all the combinations of core and <b>wrap</b> <b>materials</b> tested and over a wide variety of specimen sizes and wrap thicknesses. ...|$|E

40|$|Adipocere is a greasy, waxy {{substance}} {{produced as}} a late post-mortem change that occurs due to putrefactive and hydrolytic enzymes {{associated with the}} decomposition process. Enzymes which convert free fatty acids in adipose tissue to saturated fatty acids commonly known to comprise adipocere include myristic, palmitic, stearic and hydroxy stearic acids. Many factors can affect the decomposition process, either increasing or retarding its rate of development, but there is limited research into the effects that <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> and coverings have upon decomposition and adipocere formation in a forensic setting. A {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of different types of <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> on the rate and extent of adipocere formation on a porcine model. Analysis using Gas-Chromatography coupled with Mass-Spectrometry was employed to determine the chemical composition of adipocere which formed over a 14 week decomposition period. The results suggest that <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> accelerate the rate of adipocere formation in non-aqueous environments, suggesting that the water content within the porcine tissue is sufficient to induce adipocere formation. The chromatograms demonstrated the hydrolysis of triglycerides in fatty tissue to unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid and palmitoleic acid. The further hydrogenation into saturated fatty acids, comprising palmitic acid and stearic acid were present confirming adipocere formation. A knowledge of the effects of a variety of different types of <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> on the rate at which adipocere forms and its composition would be a useful forensic indicator and can offer valuable information for the estimation of post-mortem intervals and peri-mortem events.

All the studied parameters except marketability increased for a certain storage period and then declined due {{to the effect of}} stages of ripening and <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> (perforated and non perforated white and black polythene bag), while in case of storage temperature, there was gradual increase of physiological weight loss, sugar content (reducing, non-reducing and total sugar) and TSS content.

Six cylindrical (205 mm diameter and 925 mm height) plain columns were cast and tested. Half of the columns were wrapped with GFRP {{and the other half}} with CFRP. All columns were tested by applying an axial load at 50 mm eccentricity. In each group (GFRP or CFRP wrapped) of columns, one column did not have any vertical straps, one had vertical straps made of one layer of <b>wrapping</b> <b>material</b> and one column had vertical straps made of three layers of <b>wrapping</b> <b>material.</b> All columns were horizontally wrapped with three layers of material (GFRP or CFRP).

25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of <b>wrapping</b> <b>material.</b> The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|R
