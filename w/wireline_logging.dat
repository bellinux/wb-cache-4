50|$|First {{developed}} by Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger in 1927, <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> measure formation properties in a well through electrical lines of wire. Different from MWD and mud <b>logs,</b> <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> are constant downhole measurements sent through the electrical wireline {{used to help}} geologists, drillers and engineers make real-time decisions about drilling operations. <b>Wireline</b> <b>logs</b> can measure resistivity, conductivity and formation pressure, as well as sonic properties and wellbore dimensions.|$|R

5000|$|Formation {{evaluation}} is the {{method by which}} the data acquired during <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> are processed and evaluated to produce results which allow an estimation of oil or gas in place, amongst other things.|$|E
50|$|Many MWD tools, {{either on}} their own, or in {{conjunction}} with separate LWD tools, can take measurements of formation properties. At the surface, these measurements are assembled into a log, similar to one obtained by <b>wireline</b> <b>logging.</b>|$|E
40|$|The facies {{characteristics}} of Well A in the Field Y were studied using <b>wireline</b> <b>log</b> signatures and data derived {{from them and}} cores. The lithostratigraphy, facies types which helped {{in the interpretation of}} the depositional environments and their characteristics were read from the <b>wireline</b> <b>logs.</b> The logs were environmentally corrected and normalized. The core data analysis helped in confirming the properties of the various facies types and the effective establishment of the facies boundaries...|$|R
50|$|<b>Wireline</b> <b>logs</b> can {{be divided}} into broad {{categories}} based on the physical properties measured.|$|R

50|$|From 2006 to 2010 Saha {{worked in}} the {{petroleum}} sector as a <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> field engineer for HLS Asia Limited and Weatherford International. During his tenure he was posted at various locations in India, Bangladesh, Germany and U.A.E.|$|E
5000|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} uses <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> to obtain a continuous record of a formation's rock properties. <b>Wireline</b> <b>logging</b> can be defined as being [...] "The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services." [...] Note that [...] "wireline logging" [...] and [...] "mud logging" [...] are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to [...] "TAH" [...] - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as hydrocarbon saturation and formation pressure, and to make further drilling and production decisions.|$|E
50|$|Exploration logging is {{the process}} of <b>wireline</b> <b>logging,</b> {{geophysical}} logging, geotechnical logging or geological logging of a drill hole, its core, or its rock cuttings for petrophysics or petrology. The practice is usually used in the mining, mineral exploration or oil and natural gas sectors.|$|E

30|$|For {{the current}} study, {{geologic}} data on Hoosier field were sourced and collected from public domain sources (Alberta Geological Survey; Government of Saskatchewan). The data {{gathered for the}} current study mainly comprised of well location information, interpreted formation tops demarcating geological boundaries, <b>wireline</b> <b>logs,</b> geological maps, etc. No seismic data are available covering the study area to enable understanding of lateral continuity of lithological properties within reservoir layers. Thus, facies logs interpreted and derived from available <b>wireline</b> <b>log</b> data were heavily relied upon for establishing spatial continuity of depositional model of the reservoir. Three main geological markers (formation tops) representing three most important geological units, i.e., Mannville, Detrital, and Bakken, were identified from the <b>wireline</b> <b>log</b> interpretations of 27 well data. Figure  3 shows a stratigraphic column with the formations of interest.|$|R
30|$|Thus, basing on {{the results}} of {{analysis}} of <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> and core samples, at least two oil reservoirs are identified within the studied object.|$|R
50|$|LWD {{technology}} was originally developed to partially or completely replace <b>wireline</b> <b>logging.</b> Over the years, {{more of the}} measurements have been made available in LWD. Certain new measurements are also development in LWD only. The following is an incomplete list of available measurement in LWD technology.|$|E
50|$|Schlumberger was {{contracted}} to perform <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew {{was released by}} BP and left the rig earlier {{on the same day}} of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.|$|E

Products include downhole tools for well integrity, dry tees and surface wellheads, electric submersible pumps, <b>wireline</b> <b>logging,</b> artificial lift technologies and drilling pressure control equipment.|$|E
30|$|Effective {{porosity}} {{values for}} reservoir modeling and resources estimation {{were taken from}} <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> interpretation for Well # 7 Blagodarnenskaya, {{since there are no}} other sources of data available (Table  8).|$|R
5000|$|Driller's Depth {{is always}} recorded, and it {{constitutes}} the primary depth system, {{unless it is}} later superseded by a more accurate measurement such as the depth from an open- or cased-hole <b>wireline</b> <b>log.</b>|$|R
30|$|Water {{saturation}} of {{the reservoir}} for wells {{with a limited}} logging suit was calculated by resistivity ratio method. Summary results of <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> analysis for the available exploration wells are presented in Table  8.|$|R
50|$|LWD {{technology}} was developed originally as an enhancement {{to the earlier}} MWD technology to completely or partially replace <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> operation. With {{the improvement of the}} technology in the past decades, LWD is now widely used for drilling (including geosteering), and formation evaluation (especially for real time and high angle wells).|$|E
50|$|There are {{two other}} tools, the SP log and the Gamma Ray log, {{one or both of}} which are almost always used in <b>wireline</b> <b>logging.</b> Their output is usually {{presented}} along with the electric and porosity logs described above. They are indispensable as additional guides {{to the nature of the}} rock around the borehole.|$|E
5000|$|... or {{sodium iodide}} doped with thallium: [...] {{is by far}} the most widely used {{scintillator}} material. It is available in single crystal form or the more rugged polycrystalline form (used in high vibration environments, e.g. <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> in the oil industry). Other applications include nuclear medicine, basic research, environmental monitoring, and aerial surveys. [...] is very hygroscopic and needs to be housed in an airtight enclosure.|$|E
30|$|Petrophysical {{properties}} of the reservoirs were calculated from {{the evaluation of the}} <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> of the 13 wells. These parameters include shale volume (Vshale), net to gross (NTG), net sand, porosity and water saturation.|$|R
30|$|Reservoir {{pressures}} {{were calculated}} from the pore pressure gradient that, in turn, was obtained from lateral electric logging by Eaton relationship. <b>Wireline</b> <b>logs</b> from Well # 7 Blagodarnenskaya were utilized for pore pressure estimations.|$|R
30|$|<b>Wireline</b> <b>logs</b> {{and core}} {{analyses}} indicate that previously undiscovered oil resources {{are present in}} the section of Blagodarnenskaya structure located in Stavropol Region. Estimations predict approximately one billion of undiscovered oil to be contained in those reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|Measurements of {{interval}} transit time, designated , {{made during}} <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> {{are used to}} determine sonic velocities of the wallrock in boreholes. The tool used has sources and receivers that are {{in contact with the}} wellbore and it measures the delay between the source being triggered and the signal being received. The measurements are normally in the units of microseconds per foot and are recorded on the well log.|$|E
5000|$|The {{differences}} between loggers and drillers depths {{are due to}} different stretch in the drilling string when drilling, and the wire line entered into the bore hole during <b>wireline</b> <b>logging</b> operations. This difference is estimated and referred to as [...] "core shift". A core from a certain drillers depth is lined up with a wireline log (loggers depth) and structures in the core are compared with the log and matched.|$|E
50|$|Tools {{inserted}} into the well for both workover and logging efforts, wirelines and slicklines are very similar devices. While a slickline is a thin cable introduced into a well to deliver and retrieve tools downhole, a wireline is an electrical cable used to lower tools into and transmit data about {{the conditions of the}} wellbore called wireline logs. Usually consisting of braided cables, wirelines are used to perform <b>wireline</b> <b>logging,</b> as well.|$|E
30|$|Analysis of <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> {{suggests}} that two probably oil-saturated intervals are traced in majority of exploration wells (Table  8). The upper interval is assigned {{the designation of}} the Paleocene Layer I, the lower one—the Paleocene Layer II.|$|R
30|$|During interpretation, Well # 7 Blagodarnenskaya was {{selected}} as the reference, because it has the most complete set of <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> performed, such as: lateral logging, spontaneous potential, gamma and neutron gamma logs, mud resistivity, caliper, and temperature log.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} model {{possesses the}} capability of modelling extreme value of connections. This results in improved prediction of permeability and permeability distributions from <b>wireline</b> <b>logs</b> in partially cored/uncored intervals and adjacent wells for improved completions and enhanced recovery decisions.|$|R
