Compared to traditional ball <b>milling</b> method, <b>wet</b> ball <b>milling</b> has benefits on improvement of MgH 2 microstructure and further influences on its hydrogen sorption behavior.

Although after ball milling the grain size is decreased a lot compared to as-received MgH 2 powder, the grain size of <b>wet</b> ball <b>milled</b> MgH 2 powder is larger than that of dry ball milled MgH 2 powder due to the lubricant effect of solvent THF during <b>wet</b> ball <b>milling.</b> The improved particle size and specific surface area of <b>wet</b> ball <b>milled</b> MgH 2 powder is found to be determining its hydrogen sorption kinetics especially at relatively low temperatures.

The inorganic sludge consisted of 14. 1 mass% of the heat-treated sludge obtained after drying and heat treatment, 20. 1 mass% of active carbon, and 65. 9 mass% of water. The <b>wet</b> ball <b>milling</b> of the heat-treated sludge was performed using a ball pot and balls in air for 40 h {{at room temperature}} with the rotational speed fixed at 200 rpm.

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{in detail}} the technology and economics of substituting ethanol for gasoline. This endeavor examines three issues. First, the benefits of ethanol/gasoline blends are examined, and then the technical problems of large-scale implementation of ethanol. Second, ethanol production possibilities are examined in detail {{from a variety of}} feedstocks and technologies. The feedstocks are the starch/sugar crops and crop residues, while the technologies are corn <b>wet</b> <b>mill,</b> dry grind, and lignocellulosic fermentation. Examining {{in detail the}} production possibilities allows the researchers to identity the extent of technological change, production costs, byproducts, and GHG emissions. Finally, a U. S. agricultural model, FASOMGHG, is updated which predicts the market penetration of ethanol given technological progress, variety of technologies and feedstocks, market interactions, energy prices, and GHG prices. FASOMGHG has several interesting results. First, gasoline prices have a small expansionary impact on the U. S. ethanol industry. Both agricultural producers' income and cost both increase with higher energy prices. If wholesale gasoline is $ 4 per gallon, the predicted ethanol market penetration attains 53 % of U. S. gasoline consumption in 2030. Second, the corn <b>wet</b> <b>mill</b> remains an important industry for ethanol production, because this industry also produces corn oil, which could be converted to biodiesel. Third, GHG prices expand the ethanol industry. However, the GHG price expands the corn <b>wet</b> <b>mill,</b> but has an ambiguous impact on lignocellulosic ethanol. Feedstocks for lignocellulosic fermentation can also be burned with coal to generate electricity. Both industries are quite GHG efficient. Finally, U. S. government subsidies on biofuels have an expansionary impact on ethanol production, but may only increase market penetration by an additional 1 % in 2030, which is approximately 6 billion gallons.

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of Iowa’s ethanol industry has changed corn distribution patterns to support more local processing. As more corn is used locally in fuel production, less is available for export, feed applications, and other processing. This has led to changes in grain transport, on-farm grain storage, and the function of local grain elevators. This study collected data to indicate the magnitude of current and future impacts of ethanol production on Iowa agricultural logistics. Interviews with representatives of twenty Iowa ethanol plants revealed information about sourcing corn, processing capacity, corn storage capacity, corn quality specifications, truck and rail access, and co-product storage capacity and marketing.

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS 2) under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) currently requires the production and use of 136. 08 billion liters of renewable fuels by the year 2022. A significant portion of the requirement will come from the production of corn [Zea mays L. ] grain ethanol. Currently, two processes are primarily used to produce ethanol from corn, the dry grind process and the <b>wet</b> <b>mill</b> process. With the dramatic increase in corn grain usage for ethanol production, it is important to determine how management practice decisions affect both dry grind and <b>wet</b> <b>mill</b> ethanol yield and ethanol by-product quality. This study was conducted in Missouri during the 2007 and 2008 growing season to determine whether the management practices of planting date, planting density, or environment (location and year) have a significant affect corn grain yield, ethanol yield and kernel characteristics important in ethanol by-product quality. Whole kernel samples were tested using a FOSS Infratec 1241 Grain Analyzer to analyze kernel composition with near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Starch was not a good predictor of ethanol yield while consistent relationships were observed for protein with positive correlations for dry grind ethanol yield and negative correlations for <b>wet</b> <b>mill</b> ethanol yield. Management practices had the largest affect on grain yield while ethanol yield and kernel composition were affected to a lesser extent. This suggests selecting a planting date and planting density based on achieving the highest grain yield would be most effective practice to help meet the current RFS 2 requirements...|$|R

50|$|As the {{population}} grew, {{the beginnings of}} what became one of Candelaria’s greatest difficulties became all too apparent: there was insufficient water locally to support any significant permanent population. Candelaria was what {{was known as a}} “dry camp”. A larger spring in the next valley over (nine miles away) supplied water to Candelaria, but the costs for transporting this water to the camp drove the price to the princely sum (at the time) of $1.00 per gallon. The nearby spring was only sufficient to supply the water needs of the town's populace; little to none could be spared for the use of milling and processing the ore from the mines. The stamp mill in Candelaria had to operate as a dry mill, which spread toxic dust throughout the area. Unlike other camps where a <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> process was used, Candelaria miners suffered from an extremely high incidence of “miners consumption” (respiratory disease). Inhabitants of the area breathed in the fine particulate dust created by the dry stamping process, which brought about respiratory tract infections and diseases which often ended in death.|$|E
