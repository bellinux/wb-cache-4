5|$|On 19 February 1917, in {{a tribute}} {{from his native}} city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham. Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later {{reported}} his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot Billy Bishop, who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No.60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He impulsively invited her to fly with him, and she promptly accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification <b>wrist</b> <b>bracelet</b> in lieu of an engagement ring.|$|E

The trio are {{to drive to the}} Nuclear Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this will cause a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England.

40|$|Significant {{problems}} for the transfer of information in the complex medical environment include the requirements for machine reading {{of a variety of}} documents, linking the patient and services with certainty and in the clinical laboratory linking the sample identity with instrumental data output. A system has been developed to solve these problems. Alpha numeric including bar coded patient identity is prepared readily at patient admission in negative form for patient <b>wrist</b> <b>bracelet</b> and nursing station use. All information on the negatives can be transferred by flash illumination to an ultraviolet light sensitive gummed label which may be affixed to documents, drugs, patient sample or service. Light pen scanning of the bar code identity provides a facile entry of bar coded patient, document, service, sample or result information into a computer. In the clinical laboratory automated laser reading of the sample accession number has been coupled with on line analytical instrument output. Overall this system eliminates most manual data transcription from patient arrival to report generation. It is especially applicable to minicomputers and distributed networks...|$|E

5000|$|Her various costumes, usually {{based on}} the design or colors of the Israeli flag, contain {{additional}} paraphernalia to enhance her combat capabilities. She wears a cape that contains a secret Israeli gravity-polarization device, which allows her to neutralize gravity's effect on her mass, and a tight array of four electric micro-turbines which impel air for sufficient thrust for inertialess mass to fly at subsonic speeds. She wears special pressure reduction valve nose-filters {{to allow her to}} breathe at high speeds and high altitudes. The cape also contains a wafer-thin computer system which processes her mental commands received by the circuitry in her tiara. The cape also has an optical navigation device which functions as an auto-pilot. Besides her cape, Sabra also has neuronic-frequency stunners built into her two <b>wrist</b> <b>bracelets</b> that shoot [...] "energy quills", small bundles of low-density plasma (like balled lightning), that travel just below the speed of sound and paralyze the nervous system of any organic being almost instantaneously.|$|R

40|$|The article {{features}} {{an analysis of}} metal adornments from burial complexes of the Komarovo culture {{dating back to the}} late Bronze period for the reconstruction of the characteristics of the costume complex and adornment elements. The authors used the information on the mutual occurrence of adornments in closed complexes (burials, hoards), their location with respect to skeleton bones, and analyzed the parameters of the adornments. The relative scarcity of metal adornments discovered in burials of Komarovo culture and the absence of local sources of raw materials for their manufacture allow to consider the adornments contained in burials, especially with such high metal content as pins, bracelets and neck torcs as elements of ceremonial (wedding, funeral) adornments belonging to persons of highest social standing. A complete set of ceremonial adornments of the northern groups of Komarovo culture consisted of a pin, a neck torc and a bracelet/multiple bracelets. The most stable combination of large adornments is observed in Volyn and Kiev-Cherkasy groups: a pin, a neck torc, a pair of multi-spiral (<b>wrist)</b> <b>bracelets</b> and a pair of (shoulder?) bracelets with spiral shields. There are no bracelets with spiral shields corresponding to the Galitsia group, the multi-spiral bracelet is substituted by the massive cast bracelet, and three categories of small adornments are observed. Elite burials of the Podolsk cultural group contain a large number of small adornments: pendant rings, pendants and necklaces of amber beads which replaced neck torcs...|$|R

Here I stopped for some time {{catching}} butterflies and collecting plants. One night when I was camped there by myself, for none of my men would remain so near the Pongo country after sunset, I woke up with a sense that I was no longer alone. I crept out of my tent and by the light of the moon, which was setting, for dawn drew near, I saw a man who leant upon the handle of a very wide-bladed spear which was taller than himself, a big man over six feet two high, I should say, and broad in proportion. He wore a long, white cloak reaching from his shoulders almost to the ground. On his head was a tight-fitting cap with lappets, also white. In his ears were rings of copper or gold, and on his <b>wrists</b> <b>bracelets</b> of the same metal. His skin was intensely black, but the features were not at all negroid. They were prominent and finely-cut, the nose being sharp and the lips quite thin; indeed of an Arab type. His left hand was bandaged, and on his face was an expression of great anxiety. Lastly, he appeared to be about fifty years of age. So still did he stand that I began to wonder whether he were one of those ghosts which the Mazitu swore the Pongo wizards send out to haunt their country.|$|R

5000|$|Costumes {{play a role}} in {{illustrating}} the hula instructor's interpretation of the mele. From the color of their attire to the type of adornment worn, each piece of an auana costume symbolizes a piece of the mele auana, such as the color of a significant place or flower. While there is some freedom of choice, most hālau follow the accepted costuming traditions. Women generally wear skirts or dresses of some sort. Men may wear long or short pants, skirts, or a malo (a cloth wrapped under and around the crotch). For slow, graceful dances, the dancers will wear formal clothing such as a muumuu for women and a sash for men. A fast, lively, [...] "rascal" [...] song will be performed by dancers in more revealing or festive attire. The hula kahiko is always performed with bare feet, but the hula auana can be performed with bare feet or shoes. In the old times, they had their leis and other jewelry but their clothing was much different. Females wore a wrap called a [...] "pa'u" [...] made of tapa cloth and men wore loincloths, which are called [...] "malos". Both sex are said to have gone without a shirt. Their ankle and <b>wrist</b> <b>bracelets,</b> called [...] "kupe`e" [...] were made of whalebone and dogteeth as well as other items made from nature. Some of these make music-shells and bones will rattle against each other while the dancers dance. Women perform most Hawaiian hula dances. Female hula dancers usually wear colorful tops and skirts with lei. However, traditionally, men were just as likely to perform the hula.
