5|$|Aristotle's The Parts of Animals {{sets out}} enough {{details of his}} views on {{metabolism}} for an open flow model to be made. He believed that at each stage of the process, materials from food were transformed, <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> being released as the classical element of fire, and residual materials being excreted as urine, bile, or faeces.|$|E
5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> and pressure.|$|E

5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> or acid.

5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{regained his}} German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, {{who took over}} Caracciola's car when the latter {{collapsed}} <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> exhaustion at a pit stop. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by half a second.|$|E

5|$|Former Boise State University student Eric Matthias participated {{on behalf}} of the British Virgin Islands at the discus throw event. He was one of two British Virgin Islanders {{participating}} in a track and field event and in the 2008 Olympics as a whole. Matthias' appearance in Beijing marked his first appearance at any Olympic game. Once at the Olympics, Matthias was placed in the second qualifying heat on 16 August. He threw the discus 53.11meters, ranking last out of 18 athletes. The 17th place finalist in the second qualifying heat, Iraq's Haidar Nasser Shaheed, threw 1.08meters further, <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> leader Rutger Smith of the Netherlands throwing the discus 12.54meters further than Matthias. Overall, out of 37 athletes, Matthias placed last, and did not progress to the final round on 19 August.|$|E
5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral behavior. In {{the days after the}} earthquake, special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a Harvard professor, proposed an alternate explanation having to do <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> and chemical vapors inside the surface of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Michael Mann was {{contracted}} to direct James Dean in September 1993, and filming {{was scheduled to}} start in May 1994. Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt were under serious consideration for the lead role, while both actors were also attached to the part. Mann approached Leonardo DiCaprio {{for the role of}} James Dean, feeling that DiCaprio was the best candidate. Gary Oldman was also discussed for a supporting role. In March 1994, Mann decided not to direct James Dean due to scheduling conflicts <b>with</b> <b>Heat</b> (1995). Mann also thought that DiCaprio was too young and wanted to wait another year.|$|E

5|$|Surveys {{also show}} that green is the color most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated <b>with</b> <b>heat,</b> blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be used in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>heat,</b> or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened <b>with</b> <b>heat,</b> although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|E
