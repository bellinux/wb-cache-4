This paper mainly focuses on the property of the amplitude of the vertical motion of the water surface in the chambers. The amplification has been investigated by dimensionless parameters of wave period to resonance period ratio of the U-shaped oscillation,, chamber size to wave length ratio,, water depth to wave length ratio,, amplitude of up-down motion of water particles to draft of the front wall ratio,. It has been shown that should be less than 0. 1 and as approaches unity the up-down of the <b>water</b> in the <b>chambers</b> is amplified. Also, the structure of the walls which form th <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> has been examined roughly.

The UV lamp never contacts the water; {{it is either}} housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the <b>water</b> <b>chamber</b> or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.|$|E

After sending Storm Shadow off to the Himalayas to heal, Cobra Commander retreats to his own base of operations, where he rendezvous with Zartan (still disguised as the President). They develop Project Zeus, a super weapon, which uses kinetic bombardment and targets several prominent cities. Cobra Commander demonstrates {{the magnitude of the}} weapon's power in front of the world's leaders by demolishing London. The Joes are able to stop Cobra Commander before he unleashes the full power of Zeus, but the terrorist leader escapes after the deaths of Zartan and Firefly as well as the betrayal of Storm Shadow.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs a new {{technical}} approach, {{wave energy}} converter by using vertical motion {{of water in the}} multiple <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> were developed to realize actual wave power generation as eco-environmental renewable energy. And practical use of {{wave energy converter}} was actually to require the following conditions: (1) setting up of the relevant device and its application to wave power generation in case that severe wave loading is avoided; (2) workability in installation and maintenance operations; (3) high energy conversion potential; and (4) low cost. In this system, neither the wall(s) of the chambers nor the energy conversion device(s) are exposed to the impulsive load due to water wave. Also since this system is profitable when set along the jetty or along a long floating body, installation and maintenance are done without difficulty and the cost is reduced. In this paper, we describe the system which consists of a float, a shaft connected with another shaft, a rack and pinion arrangement, a ratchet mechanism, and rotary type generator(s). Then, we present the dynamics model for evaluating the output electric power, and the results of numerical calculation including the effect of the phase shift of up/down motion of the water in the array of <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> aligned along the direction of wave propagation...|$|R

60|$|Of all land-frequenting fish, however, by far {{the most}} famous is the {{so-called}} climbing perch of India, which not only walks bodily out of the water, but even climbs trees by means of special spines, near the head and tail, so arranged as to stick into the bark and enable it to wriggle its way up awkwardly, something after the same fashion as the 'looping' of caterpillars. The tree-climber is a small scaly fish, seldom more than seven inches long; but it has developed a special breathing apparatus to enable it to keep up the stock of oxygen on its terrestrial excursions, which may be regarded as to some extent the exact converse of the means employed by divers to supply themselves with air under water. Just above the gills, which form of course its natural hereditary breathing apparatus, the climbing perch has invented a new and wholly original <b>water</b> <b>chamber,</b> containing within it a frilled bony organ, which enables it to extract oxygen from the stored-up water during the course of its aërial peregrinations. While on shore it picks up small insects, worms, and grubs; but it also has vegetarian tastes of its own, and does not despise fruits and berries. The Indian jugglers tame the climbing perches and carry them about with them as part of their stock in trade; their ability to live for a long time out of water makes them useful confederates in many small tricks which seem very wonderful to people accustomed to believe that fish die almost at once when taken out of their native element.|$|E

50|$|While air based, {{the split}} air vs <b>water</b> {{pressure}} <b>chamber</b> has a sliding plunger {{that separates the}} compressed air from the water. This technology has so far only been seen on the Water Warriors Aqua Master PreCharger Series. A button is used to toggle whether the pump is priming/pre-pressurizing the pressure chamber with air or whether the pump is moving water into the pressure chamber. Akin to pre-pressurizing the Separate Pressure <b>Chamber</b> <b>water</b> guns, the split air / <b>water</b> pressure <b>chamber</b> takes this one step further by preventing the accidental, undesired release of the pre-pressurized air by keeping it separated from the water by a sliding piston divider. After all the water is expelled from the pressure chamber, the sliding piston prevents loss of the pressurized air, thus {{reducing the number of}} times the water gun must be pumped in order to achieve optimal firing pressure.|$|R
50|$|Detection of SIS {{stimulates the}} giant clam to swell its mantle {{in the central}} region and to {{contract}} its adductor muscle. Each clam then fills its <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> and closes the incurrent syphon. The shell contracts vigorously with the adductor's help, so the excurrent chamber's contents flows through the excurrent syphon. After a few contractions containing only water, eggs and sperm appear in the excurrent chamber and then pass through the excurrent syphon into the water. Female eggs have a diameter of 100 micrometre in. Egg release initiates the reproductive process. An adult T. gigas can release more than 500 million eggs at a time.|$|R

To determine whether the air bubble may function as a physical gill in this species we submitted three groups of snails to different systems in which water contained {{the same level of}} dissolved oxygen whereas the gas phases were atmospheric air, pure nitrogen or pure oxygen. We observed the following parameters: time of permanence on the surface, time of immersion, and frequency at which the snails reached the surface.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common PET isotopes, 18 F, is mainly {{produced}} in liquid targets. The production yield depends linearly on the proton beam current used. However, for a fixed proton-beam energy increasing the current of the proton beam results in depositing increasing amounts of heat into the enclosed <b>water</b> target <b>chamber</b> and eventually in its failure. Hence, understanding the thermodynamics of a <b>water</b> target <b>chamber</b> could lead to a target optimization, removing the maximum amount of heat to balance the pressure, increasing the yield and guaranteeing the stability and durability of the system.
