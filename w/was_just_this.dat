It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury. The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions – from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837 – meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.|$|E

The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in downtown Manhattan—Max's Kansas City and, more famously, CBGB (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16, 1974. Legs McNeil, who cofounded Punk magazine the following year, later described the impact of that performance: [...] "They were all wearing these black leather jackets. And they counted off this song... and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> wall of noise... They looked so striking. These guys were not hippies. This was something completely new." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Stoltz's departure, Fox's {{schedule}} during weekdays {{consisted of}} filming Family Ties during the day, and Back to the Future from 6:30 pm to 2:30 am.

During Fridays, he shot from 10 pm to 6 or 7 am, and {{then moved on to}} film exterior scenes throughout the weekend, as only then was he available during daytime hours. Fox found it exhausting, but [...] "it was my dream to be in the film and television business, although I didn't know I'd be in them simultaneously. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> weird ride and I got on." [...] Zemeckis concurred, dubbing Back to the Future [...] "the film that would not wrap".

So, you take elements of rock and steel and chisel them into interesting shapes." [...] She also describes the creation of the set by stating, [...] "I found the backdrop from Alien, and Bill Roe lit it very dimly and put it behind. And it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull his face apart." [...] According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped {{in the creation of the}} alien torture machine by making the cheeks and putting the hooks in. The makeup supervisor adds that the hooks would actually stretch out and that David Duchovny [...] "sat pretty good through all that." ...|$|E

Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
500|$|The Colour of Magic is {{the second}} live-action {{adaptation}} of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, following the highly successful Hogfather, which was broadcast over Christmas 2006 {{to an audience of}} 2.6 million. After the success of Hogfather, Pratchett was easily persuaded to release the rights for The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. Vadim Jean was employed to adapt the two literary works into a three-hour, two-part screenplay. [...] While Pratchett was given [...] "carte blanche" [...] to [...] "turn up whenever [...] wanted", he was happy to see a more liberal interpretation of his first two works than he had been for Hogfather. Speaking to Sky Magazine, Pratchett said that, [...] "There [...] not so much emotional baggage... riding on The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> book of mine that suddenly started selling incredibly well". Jean's main challenge was to streamline the plot and remove the many irrelevant, but highly amusing, tangents that are an iconic feature of Pratchett's work, without destroying the appeal of the books. [...] Jean said that [...] "there [...] a real danger, with this story, that one could strip out the 'Pratchett-ness'... I had to fight to keep [...] in". Pratchett was pleased with the final script, saying [...] "it wasn't the slaughter job I thought it would have to be", and [...] " [...] to keep the soul... it's still recognisably [...] book".|$|E
