500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What <b>would</b> <b>your</b> take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "It {{should be}} made clear that if {{fundamentalism}} or terrorism exist, they are {{a reaction to the}} colonial militarism of the West in the Islamic world, from the 18th century until today. European armies occupied all of North and South America and Africa, in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, and divided them among themselves. Then they came to the Islamic world in North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is only natural that the Muslims act in accordance with their religious duty, just as you would defend your homes if they were occupied. Why do we call resistance 'terrorism'? When Hitler and the Fascists rolled Europe in blood and dust – <b>would</b> <b>your</b> forefathers be called terrorists if they conducted resistance?" ...|$|E

Then the fourth person <b>would</b> take <b>your</b> clothes off and beat you with a stick. They did not tie us and hang us up, but they tied me against a wall and gave me shocks. They would prod us all over our backs. They would expose our breasts and prod us. They would make us sit on a chair and then slap our faces and push us off the chair so that we fell to the ground." ...|$|R

2500|$|Hood {{became the}} brigade {{commander}} of the unit that was henceforth known as Hood's Texas Brigade on February 20, 1862, part of the Confederate Army of the Potomac, and was promoted to brigadier general on March 3, 1862. Leading the Texas Brigade {{as part of the}} Army of Northern Virginia in the Peninsula Campaign, he established his reputation as an aggressive commander, eager to lead his troops personally into battle, and the Texans quickly gained {{a reputation as one of}} the army's elite combat units. At the Battle of Eltham's Landing, his men were instrumental in nullifying an amphibious landing by a Union division. When commanding general Joseph E. Johnston reflected upon the success Hood's men enjoyed in executing his order [...] "to feel the enemy gently and fall back," [...] he humorously asked, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>your</b> Texans have done, sir, if I had ordered them to charge and drive back the enemy?" [...] Hood replied, [...] "I suppose, General, they would have driven them into the river, and tried to swim out and capture the gunboats." [...] The Texas Brigade was held in reserve at Seven Pines.|$|E

[...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Is it that signs of blessings have not occurred?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "They have." [...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Then, why is it that I still cannot conduct Fengshan?"'Wei responded, [...] "Even though Your Imperial Majesty has accomplished these six areas, we are still inheriting the state left after the great confusion at the end of Sui rule. [...] The population is greatly reduced and has not recovered. [...] The food stores are still empty. [...] When Your Imperial Majesty heads east , the thousands of horses and wagons require supplies everywhere they go, and it is difficult for the local government to do so. [...] In addition, at Fengshan, the rulers and chiefs of the nations should all attend you. [...] However, from the Yi and Luo Rivers [...] to the Sea [...] and Mount Dai , there are still few villages and few people. [...] The weeds grow thickly without end, and this would be inviting barbarians to our abdomen and showing them our weaknesses.
