500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was the sort of person <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard's {{early work}} was written under various pseudonyms {{that he used}} to present {{distinctive}} viewpoints and to interact with each other in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote many Upbuilding Discourses under his own name and dedicated them to the [...] "single individual" [...] <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to discover the meaning of his works. Notably, he wrote: [...] "Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject." [...] While scientists can learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation could reveal {{the inner workings of the}} world of the spirit.|$|E
50|$|An {{interest}} graph is {{an online}} {{representation of the}} specific things in which an individual is interested.Interest graphs have perceived utility and value because of the premise that people’s interests are a major aspect of who they are, forming part of their personal identity, {{and can be used}} as indicators of such things as what they <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to do or buy, where they <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to go, or <b>who</b> they <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to meet, follow or vote for.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{according}} to older SOCs is often reserved for transsexual people only, not for other transgender people, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> to undergo the {{complete set of}} treatments, or who see themselves outside a binary gender system.

On 24 August 1779, he was {{executed}} at Kolkondas, Fier District, {{near the mouth of}} the Seman river (in present-day Albania). There were no formal charges brought against him, nor was he put on trial before being executed - leading to various theories, persisting up to the present, about <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> him dead.|$|R
2500|$|This is {{the second}} Smashing Pumpkins album {{released}} for free over the Internet, the first being 2000's Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music. [...] Teargarden is seeing such a release due to Corgan's reported hope that people hear the album before dismissing it, {{on top of his}} interest in [...] "subverting a system that works against holistic thinking when it comes to how art is made and delivered to those <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to hear it." [...] All of the songs were planned to be released for free as 192-kbps, DRM-free MP3 files, available from direct links on the band's website. Finally, a complete box set release is planned that will contain all of the tracks accompanied by an art film and a making-of documentary. [...] Corgan says he is also considering a single-CD compilation of the best of the forty-four tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Often a {{separate}} institution, called a special purpose vehicle, is created {{to handle the}} securitization of asset backed securities. [...] The special purpose vehicle, which creates and sells the securities, uses the {{proceeds of the sale}} to pay back the bank that created, or originated, the underlying assets. [...] The special purpose vehicle is responsible for [...] "bundling" [...] the underlying assets into a specified pool that will fit the risk preferences and other needs of investors <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to buy the securities, for managing credit risk – often by transferring it to an insurance company after paying a premium – and for distributing payments from the securities. [...] As long as the credit risk of the underlying assets is transferred to another institution, the originating bank removes the value of the underlying assets from its balance sheet and receives cash in return as the asset backed securities are sold, a transaction which can improve its credit rating and reduce the amount of capital that it needs. [...] In this case, a credit rating of the asset backed securities would be based only on the assets and liabilities of the special purpose vehicle, and this rating could be higher than if the originating bank issued the securities because the risk of the asset backed securities would no longer be associated with other risks that the originating bank might bear. [...] A higher credit rating could allow the special purpose vehicle and, by extension, the originating institution to pay a lower interest rate (and hence, charge a higher price) on the asset-backed securities than if the originating institution borrowed funds or issued bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Ronnie later persuades Phil {{to come to}} Billy and Honey's {{engagement}} {{party where}} he coughs up blood and in hospital, the Mitchells are told Phil will be dead within twelve months unless he stops drinking and has a liver transplant.

Ronnie receives flowers with a card reading [...] "RIP", and discovers the person who sent them gave their name as Danielle Jones. Ronnie confronts Hannah, who denies it all and Ronnie believes her, but Jack discovers Hannah's name was on the credit card that paid for the flowers, so Ronnie tells Hannah she knows she sent the flowers. Hannah steps into the road while holding Matthew and is nearly hit by a car. She is arrested for harassing Ronnie. However, Ronnie is still being watched by someone else. Ronnie becomes friends with Andy Flynn (Jack Derges), a builder who is helping Jack to renovate Max's old house into flats. Ronnie speaks in Hannah's defence in court and the charges are dropped.

I have learnt to enter into his affection and deep feeling and anxieties, and I would not have missed these four years of reciprocity with him for anything! And I shall get on better with mamma now. I fancy she has a different nature after all, from what my aunt forced on her. Well, then, you know I have long set up for a maiden aunt, and there is John, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> a housekeeper. Or if I am of no use to my own folks, there are the poor always. Perhaps I may come to Emma Brandon's priory. It would be fine discipline to be under Mother Theresa.|$|E
