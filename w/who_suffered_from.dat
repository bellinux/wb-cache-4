5|$|In the meantime, war-weariness had set {{in among}} the Venetians, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> the {{disruption}} in trade. Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable to the Republic.

40|$|Number of {{patients}} with hypertension have increased from year to year. This is due to an unhealthy lifestyle, excessive stress and so forth. Patiens with hypertension are often unaware of the dangers that {{can be caused by}} disease. The medical diagnosis of hypertension is made when obtained blood pressure is obtained more than 140 / 90 mmHg. In this study, created a system of enforcement of hypertension using sugeno fuzzy logic. This application uses the parameters of age, body mass index, blod pressure(systole and diastole), family history (genetics), diabetes mellitus. From testing the fuzzy logic that has been done, can be obtained on the calculation of 60 patients <b>who</b> did not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension (normal) as much 3 people, <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> prehypertension as much 17 people, <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension grade 1 as much 25 people and <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension degrees 2 as much 15 people.

Guthy-Renker {{were already in}} the infomercial business and agreed to market and distribute it. The first infomercial appeared in October 1995, offering a money-back guarantee and fast delivery, and featuring Judith Light, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> acne problems herself. Rodan and Fields later founded their own skincare brand, Rodan + Fields.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, on July 13, two Disaster Recovery Centers {{opened to}} provide {{information}} {{to those who have}} suffered damage. The next day, state and federal community relations teams were deployed into Alabama’s disaster-declared counties, to assist residents <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> Dennis. The Alabama Emergency Management Agency (AEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had 20federal community relations specialists and their state counterparts working in the disaster areas. Subsequently, three more Disaster Recovery Centers became scheduled to open on July 16.|$|E
5|$|That year, Bachelot, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> {{a form of}} rheumatism, {{became very}} sick. By November1837, he had {{recovered}} sufficiently to leave Hawaii.

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} production of penicillin {{took place in}} the town. In 1938 Howard Florey was working at Lincoln College, Oxford University with Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley, when he read Alexander Fleming's paper discussing the antibacterial effects of Penicillium notatum mould. He made arrangements for this to be grown in deep culture tanks at the Medical Research Council's Antibiotic Research Station in Clevedon, enabling mass production of this mould for the injections of the forthcoming soldiers of World War II <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> wounds caused by weapons.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{city hall}} was {{partially}} destroyed. Along {{the northwest corner}} of the building, the exterior wall in its entirely collapsed, while the north tower was destroyed. The bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E
5|$|At Leavenworth, Garrido met Nancy Bocanegrathe {{secondary}} arrestee in Dugard's kidnapping who {{was visiting}} another prisoner, her uncle. On October 5, 1981, he and Bocanegra were married at Leavenworth. On January 22, 1988, Garrido {{was released from}} Leavenworth to Nevada State Prison, where he served seven months of a five-years-to-life Nevada sentence. He was transferred to federal parole authorities in Contra Costa on August 26, 1988. In Antioch, the Garridos lived {{in the home of}} his elderly mother, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> dementia. As a parolee, he was monitored, later wore a GPS-enabled ankle bracelet, and was visited many times by parole officers, local sheriff's deputies, and federal agents.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{came from}} an old line of country nobility. His direct {{ancestors}} {{had served in the}} Fifth Crusade against Egypt, and again in the Eighth Crusade of Saint Louis against Tunisia in 1270. They had also fought at the Battle of Saint-Omer in 1340 and the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. The family managed to survive the French Revolution. Three members of the family served in Napoleon's Grande Armée and a fourth, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> weak health, served in the supply train. The third son, Constantin, who had served in Napoleon's Russian Campaign, was created a chevalier by King Louis XVIII, and a Papal count by Pope Pius IX in 1857. Constantin had two sons. The older, Alfred Francois Marie (1822–1902), died childless. The younger, Gustave Francois Marie Joseph (1829–1914), became a noted Egyptologist.|$|E

5|$|Most historians {{state that}} Deusdedit {{died of the}} plague that was {{prevalent}} in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions {{the outbreak of the}} plague, the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably bubonic plague. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were unable}} to start a fire using {{friction}} due to the thin air at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to give some protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E

5|$|The song {{appears in}} The Acoustic Album (2006). It was {{performed}} in 2006 by the New England octogenarian chorus group Young@Heart. The group's performance was led by former chorus member Fred Knittle, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> congestive heart failure and breathed with assistance from an oxygen tank. The performance was originally planned to be a duet between Knittle and Bob Salvini, another former chorus member, but Salvini died shortly before the show. Knittle performed it as a solo, {{as a tribute to}} his friend. The performance was initially recorded for a British documentary that aired on Channel 4; footage of the performance was uploaded to YouTube in November 2006 to positive response. An expanded version of the film, titled Young@Heart, debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival and was released in US theatres in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Winners of the Branch Rickey Award have {{undertaken}} different causes. Many winners, including Todd Stottlemyre, Jamie Moyer, John Smoltz, Torii Hunter, Vernon Wells, and Shane Victorino, worked {{with children in}} need. Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old girl <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant, while Moyer's foundation raised US$6million to support underprivileged children. Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself to working with individuals with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to work with major disasters and tragedies. Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks, while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of many}} citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E
