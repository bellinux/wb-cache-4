25|$|Poodles {{are highly}} trainable dogs that {{typically}} excel in obedience training.

25|$|Since reverse swing {{occurs at}} faster speeds, {{later in the}} {{trajectory}} of the ball and with no real obvious change in action and grip (Waqar Younis from Pakistan for example had the same action and grip for nearly all his deliveries), batsmen with a quick eye and reflexes <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>well.</b> In his autobiography Wasim Akram mentions four batsmen— Adam Gilchrist, Brian Lara, Aravinda De Silva and Martin Crowe —who had such reflexes and who were exceedingly difficult to bowl to.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews were {{prepared}} by G. E. Moore and Charles Sanders Peirce, but Moore's was never published {{and that of}} Peirce was brief and somewhat dismissive.

2500|$|Dev.D has 18 tracks by artiste Amit Trivedi. The {{songs were}} written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, Shellee, Anusha Mani, and Shruti Pathak. Released on 31 December under T-Series, he {{specifically}} reports {{that there are two}} special Punjabi tracks, one which is raw Punjabi and the other with a street band baaja flavor to it. He also reports two romantic Haryanvi folk tracks, apart from a hard rock song, world music, an Awadhi number and a song with 1970s-80s pop touch to it. The soundtrack received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critic Joginder Tuteja said, [...] "Chuck the very thought around whether this album <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> commercially or not; it is an exemplary piece of work and that's what that matters most." [...] Ekansh Aatre, critic of Hindustan Times fame, said [...] "Each part of each song in this album is special & gives a great impact on audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Lewis relates “Although we {{had been}} counseled by Joseph the Prophet to leave the mill and go to Far West, but being deceived by the {{messenger}} we sent him for council, we understood it not, for our messenger said to Joseph what shall we do {{that is at the}} mill, Joseph said gather up all of you and come to Far West. [...] "What?" [...] said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, [...] "leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it." [...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix Felicis, more {{commonly}} known as Liquid Luck, grants whoever drinks it unusually good luck. The time span of this luck depends on the amount imbibed. Liquid Luck {{is one of the}} hardest potions to make, as noted by Horace Slughorn; [...] "It has to be cooked for 6 months on an extremely complicated formula, and if you make a tiniest mistake, the consequences are severe". Because of its properties, it is banned in all sporting events, competitions and examinations. In Rowling's original narrative, the potion looks akin to liquid gold. However, in the movie adaptation it is clear and water-like. Slughorn also noted that excessive consumption results in side effects that include giddiness and overzealousness, among other effects that are related to overconfidence. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry pretends to give some to Ron so that he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> at Quidditch. Ron's luck turns for the better, with the confidence working as a placebo. Harry does use most of it later in the same novel in order to extract the true memory about Tom Riddle and Horcruxes from Slughorn (though it also has the pleasant side effect of causing Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley to end their relationship), and the rest is shared between Ron, Hermione, Neville Longbottom and Ginny the night Death Eaters break into Hogwarts.|$|E
