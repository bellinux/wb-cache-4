60|$|At {{first sight}} {{it might seem}} as though there were hardly enough of such pungent and fiery things in {{existence}} to make it worth while {{for us to be}} provided with a special mechanism for guarding against them. That is true enough, no doubt, as regards our modern civilised life; though, even now, it is perhaps just as well that our children should have an internal monitor (other than conscience) to dissuade them immediately from indiscriminate indulgence in photographic chemicals, the contents of stray medicine bottles, and the best dried West India chilies. But in an earlier period of progress, and especially in tropical countries (where the Darwinians have now decided the human race made its first début upon this or any other stage), things were very different indeed. Pungent and poisonous plants and fruits abounded on every side. We have all of us in our youth been taken in by some too cruelly waggish companion, who insisted upon making us eat the bright, glossy leaves of the common English arum, which without look pretty and juicy enough, but within are full of the concentrated essence of pungency and profanity. Well, there are hundreds of such plants, even in cold climates, to tempt the eyes and poison the veins of unsuspecting cattle or childish humanity. There is buttercup, so horribly acrid that cows carefully avoid it in their closest cropped pastures; and yet your cow is not usually a too dainty animal. There is aconite, the deadly poison with which Dr. Lamson removed his troublesome relatives. There is baneberry, whose very name sufficiently describes its dangerous nature. There are horse-radish, and stinging rocket, and biting wall-pepper, and still smarter <b>water-pepper,</b> and worm-wood, and nightshade, and spurge, and hemlock, and half a dozen other equally unpleasant weeds. All of these have acquired their pungent and poisonous properties, just as nettles have acquired their sting, and thistles their thorns, in order to prevent animals from browsing upon them and destroying them. And the animals in turn have acquired a very delicate sense of pungency on purpose to warn them beforehand of the existence of such dangerous and undesirable qualities in the plants which they might otherwise be tempted incautiously to swallow.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, a {{considerable}} interest {{was paid to}} ecological strategies in management of plant diseases and plant growth. Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) gained considerable interest as alternative to pesticides due to their interesting properties. Green synthesis of MNPs using plant extracts is very advantageous {{taking into account the}} fact that plants are easily available and eco-friendly and possess many phytocompounds that help in bioreduction of metal ions. In this research work, we phytosynthesized AgNPs from aqueous extract of Citrus reticulata peels, with high antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal potential. These “green” AgNPs were characterized by modern biophysical methods (absorption and FTIR spectroscopy, AFM, and zeta potential measurements). The nanobioimpact of Citrus-based AgNPs on four invasive wetland plants, Cattail (Typha latifolia), Flowering-rush (Butomus umbellatus), Duckweed (Lemna minor), and <b>Water-pepper</b> (Polygonum hydropiper), was studied by absorption spectroscopy, by monitoring the spectral signature of chlorophyll. The invasive plants exhibited different behavior under AgNP stress. Deep insights were obtained from experiments conducted on biomimetic membranes marked with chlorophyll a. Our results pointed out the potential use of Citrus-based AgNPs as alternative in controlling pathogens in aqueous media and in management of aquatic weeds growth...|$|E
40|$|Persicaria minor (Huds.) Opiz {{known as}} Small <b>water-pepper</b> and well {{recognized}} locally in Malaysia as “daun kesum” is an edible vegetable with nutritional and medicinal benefits utilized generally by South-east Asians. The {{present study was}} conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activity of standardized aqueous-ethanolic and water extracts of P. minor leaves. The leaves of the plant undergone extraction based on Malaysian Standard Guideline which is 30 % aqueousethanol and absolute water as normally used in traditional medicine to produce the respective extract concentrates. Both extracts were evaluated for total protein and polysaccharide contents in which aqueous-ethanolic extract was found to possess high contents of proteins (1713. 67 µg/ml) while contents of polysaccharides were high in absolute water extract (17. 6 µg/ml). These measurements were used as a standard for different batch extract. The extracts were then tested against four standard strains of bacteria which are Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 11229, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 at different concentrations using discdiffusion (qualitative) and microplate dilution (quantitative) assays. For positive and negative control, penicillin and dimethylsulfoxide were used as controls, respectively. Both extracts showed antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values in the range of 50 to 100 mg/mL against S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli, respectively with aqueous-ethanolic extract being more potent. However, none of the extracts were active against P. aeruginosa. Results from this study truly illustrated high potential of P. minor leaves as natural antibacterial agent for the elimination of various bacterial disease and infections...|$|E
