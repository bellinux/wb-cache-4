5|$|On July 24, 1979, Keeler was {{appointed}} Auxiliary Bishop of Harrisburg and Titular Bishop of Ulcinium. He received his episcopal consecration on September 21 from Bishop Joseph Thomas Daley, with Bishops Francis Gossman and Martin Lohmuller serving as co-consecrators. Keeler took as his episcopal motto: Opus Fac Evangelistae ("Do the <b>Work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Evangelist").|$|E
5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|Six {{days after}} the attack on Centaur, a request {{was made by the}} Australian Department of Defence that the {{identification}} markings and lights be removed from Australian hospital ship Manunda, weapons be installed, and that she begin to sail blacked out and under escort. The conversion was performed, although efforts by the Department of the Navy, the Admiralty, and authorities in New Zealand and the United States of America caused the completed conversion to be undone. The cost of the roundabout work came to £12,500, and kept Manunda out of service for three months. On 9 June 1943, communications between the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to the Manunda incident {{as a response to the}} attack on Centaur, with the conclusion that the attack was the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> irresponsible Japanese commander, and that it would be better to wait until further attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings.|$|E
5|$|Traherne was an inconsequential {{literary}} figure {{during his}} lifetime and his works were not known or appreciated until long after his death. As a country priest he led a devout, humble life and {{did not participate in}} literary circles. Only one of his works, Roman Forgeries (1673), was published in his lifetime. Christian Ethicks (1675) followed soon after his death, and later A Serious and Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God (1699), which was published as the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anonymous author whose character and background were discussed in a brief introduction by the publisher. From 1699 until the re-emergence of his work with Bertram Dobell's editions in 1903, Traherne's work fell into obscurity. If not for the chance discovery of an anonymous manuscript, his work and reputation might have been lost.|$|E
5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E

5|$|Mother {{begins with}} the story of a young, married, American couple who mysteriously vanish from their small, rural town. Two years later, the husband, George, {{returned}} as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in the late 1980s (dated specifically as 1988 in the Famicom version, but kept ambiguous in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked at home in a paranormal event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to be the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invading alien race. After finishing a few tasks, Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd, who is being teased at an elementary school. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally {{thought to}} be an epitome (summary) of Matthew, which {{accounts}} for its place as the second gospel in the Bible, most scholars now regard it as the earliest of the gospels, dating from c. AD 66–70. Most scholars also reject the tradition which ascribes it to Mark the Evangelist, the companion of Peter, and regard it as the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unknown author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.|$|E

On 22 November 1984, the Dog Island Lighthouse was registered as a Category I structure, with registration number 395. The lighthouse is significant for its height, its age, {{and the relatively}} rare use of masonry for such a structure. It is also {{an example of the}} <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engineer who was prominent at his time.|$|E
25|$|Up until 1991, all magistrates {{were also}} gazetted as {{industrial}} magistrates. The process of gazetting {{is simply to}} give a magistrate a dual role or appointment. From 1991, magistrates were automatically appointed as an industrial magistrate under the Industrial Relations Act 1991. In practice, however, all <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> industrial nature was performed by the Chief Industrial Magistrate. In 1996, a new Industrial Act was passed. Under this law, magistrates are now only appointed on a needs basis to assist the Chief Industrial Magistrate {{in his or her}} duties.|$|E
25|$|After a few centuries, {{the first}} {{settlement}} was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, {{there was a}} settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BC, perhaps represents the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and {{it is thought that}} they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.|$|E
