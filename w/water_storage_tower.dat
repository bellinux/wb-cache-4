50|$|The organization's {{mission is}} to promote public health in South Africa by {{providing}} easy access to clean, potable water in rural communities. Field designed a self-sustainable system that enabled water to be pumped into a storage tower. This model resulted in a mechanical water extraction process designed after a playground merry-go-round, which {{is attached to a}} water pump. Rotational energy generated by children playing is then used to fill the <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tower.</b> The system enhances living conditions and offers playing equipment for the young population. Since its invention, hundreds of water pump systems have been installed, particularly through the aid of monetary donations and governmental approvals.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: A 1993 large {{water-borne}} {{outbreak of}} Salmonella typhimurium infections in Gideon, Mo, {{a city of}} 1100 with an unchlorinated community water supply, was investigated to determine the source of contamination {{and the effectiveness of}} an order to boil water. METHODS: A survey of household members in Gideon and the surrounding township produced information on diarrheal illness, water consumption, and compliance with the boil water order. RESULTS: More than 650 persons were ill; 15 were hospitalized, and 7 died. Persons consuming city water {{were more likely to be}} ill (relative risk [RR] = 9. 1, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 9, 28. 4), and the attack rate increased with increased water consumption. S. typhimurium was recovered from samples taken from a city fire hydrant and a <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tower.</b> Persons in 31 % (30 / 98) of city households had drunk unboiled water after being informed about the boil water order, including 14 individuals who subsequently became ill. Reasons for noncompliance included "not remembering" (44 %) and "disbelieving" (25 %) the order. CONCLUSIONS: Communities with deteriorating water systems risk widespread illness unless water supplies are properly operated and maintained. Effective education to improve compliance during boil water orders is needed...|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{environmental}} restoration required by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan calls for more water-storage on lands south of Lake Okeechobee in order to restore the natural water flows of the Everglades watershed. The Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) can be used for increased <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> in order to relieve coastal estuaries of excess water in the rainy season. This <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> can deliver additional ecosystem services of soil retention and reduced CO 2 emissions that could compensate farmers for the cost of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> by increasing long term farm profitability. The goals of this study were 1) to quantify the environmental and economic trade-offs of different <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> scenarios using water-tolerant sugarcane cultivars, and 2) to quantify the amount of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> possible in the EAA under different <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> scenarios. A mathematical model was developed to calculate soil depth, soil subsidence, depth to the water table, sugarcane production, farm return, <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> and carbon loss for three different sugarcane cultivars with different water-tolerances. A GIS tool is also developed to estimate the amount of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> possible in the EAA. The study found that even though water-tolerant sugarcane cultivars experience higher yields and net returns than non-water-tolerant cultivars the <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> costs with these water tolerant cultivars was greater. Raising water tables on farm lands did have the environmental benefits of reduced soil subsidence, extended farm life and increased years of <b>water</b> <b>storage.</b> However total CO 2 emissions rise from 14 to 136 %. Results of the GIS analysis revealed that <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> capacity for a DWT of 61 cm is 1, 404, 562 ac-ft, 1, 417, 400 ac-ft for DWT 45 cm and 1, 474, 692 ac-ft for DWT 20 cm. The GIS analysis was also able to identify flow ways that could possibly carry water south from Lake Okeechobee and ultimately to the WCAs south of the EAA. These results show that raising water tables in the EAA to deliver the ecosystem service of expanded <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> is overall more costly, but yearly costs are very low. Therefore <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> on farmlands is an affordable interim method of <b>water</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|R
40|$|While <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> is an {{important}} variable to understand the hydrological functioning of a catchment, {{it is challenging to}} estimate the total <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> in a catchment. Catchment <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> can be estimated based on the water balance, but this approach is prone to errors in the different water balance terms. Here an approach is presented to estimate the daily dynamics of catchment-wide soil- and groundwater <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> based on groundwater level observations, soil properties, and an assumption of hydrological equilibrium above the water table. This approach was applied to a 6, 300 m 2 till catchment in Southwest Sweden. The predicted mean catchment <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> between April 1991 and June 1992 was 210 mm and ranged from 190 to 260 mm. The estimated <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> followed runoff rates closely especially during recession periods. On average, 79 % of the <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> was held in the unsaturated zone and the remaining 21 % was groundwater, but this proportion varied strongly with runoff and total storage.

40|$|Irrigation {{development}} is rapidly expanding in mostly rainfed Sub-Saharan Africa. This expansion underscores {{the need for}} a more comprehensive understanding of water resources beyond surface water. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites provide valuable information on spatio-temporal variability in <b>water</b> <b>storage.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} calibrate and evaluate a semi-distributed regional-scale hydrologic model based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) code for basins in Sub-Saharan Africa using seven-year (July 2002 �April 2009) 10 -day GRACE data and multi-site river discharge data. The analysis was conducted in a multi-criteria framework. In spite of the uncertainty arising from the tradeoff in optimising model parameters with respect to two noncommensurable criteria defined for two fluxes, SWAT was found to perform well in simulating total <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> variability in most areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, which have semi-arid and sub-humid climates, and that among various <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> represented in SWAT, <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> variations in soil, vadose zone and groundwater are dominant. The study also showed that the simulated total <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> variations tend to have less agreement with GRACE data in arid and equatorial humid regions, and model-based partitioning of total <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> variations into different <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> compartments may be highly uncertain.

The soil infiltration rate and <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of pine-oak mixed forest under three different thinning intensity treatments (15 %, 30 %, and 60 %) were studied in Qinling Mountains of China.

The soil infiltration rate and <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> capacity in different thinning treatments followed the order of control (nonthinning) : < 60 %, < 15 %, and < 30 %. It demonstrated that thinning operation with 30 % intensity can substantially improve soil infiltration rate and <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of pine-oak mixed forest in Qinling Mountains. The soil initial infiltration rate, stable infiltration rate, and average infiltration rate in thinning 30 % treatment were significantly increased by 21. 1 %, 104. 6 %, and 60. 9 %, compared with the control.
