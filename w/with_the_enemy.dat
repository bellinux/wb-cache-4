5|$|As the Afrika Korps {{retreated into}} Libya and Tunisia, the 2nd Division, {{as part of}} X Corps, was in pursuit. A series of engagements <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> followed, occupying Kippenberger and his men. After the battle at Takrouna, the 5th Brigade was {{withdrawn}} from the frontlines, having lost 38% of its strength. He remained a highly regarded officer, deputising as commander of the 2nd Division in Freyberg's occasional absence from the field in higher commands.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in May, {{the brigade}} endured 112 {{consecutive}} days of skirmishes, comprising 86 separate clashes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Though {{most of the}} skirmishes were small, {{by the end of}} the period, injuries and desertion had cut the regiment's strength by 25%. Ross was captured in late July at the Battle of Brown's Mill, but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate cavalry counterattack.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war, her encounters <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> were infrequent. In fact, her next submarine contact did not occur until 17December and, like those before, resulted in no definite damage to the enemy. Although the opening months of 1918 brought no new U-boat contacts, Wadsworth worked hard escorting convoys and patrolling British waters.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück. The unit {{not only had}} to contend <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> but also with working through the 'teething' phase of the Me 262and developing the tactics appropriate for a jet unit. On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{spent the}} following {{winter and spring}} near Charleston, Virginia (present-day West Virginia), out of contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Hayes saw little action until July 1863, when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan's cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island. Returning to Charleston {{for the rest of}} the summer, Hayes spent the fall encouraging the men of the 23rd Ohio to re-enlist, and many did so. In 1864, the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized, and Hayes's division was assigned to George Crook's Army of West Virginia. Advancing into southwestern Virginia, they destroyed Confederate salt and lead mines there. On May 9, they engaged Confederate troops at Cloyd's Mountain, where Hayes and his men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field. Following the rout, the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and again successfully skirmished <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The stay of the {{division}} in this sector was marked by several serious encounters <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> where considerable forces were engaged. There were furthermore almost nightly encounters between patrols or ambush parties, and the harassing fire of the artillery on both sides was very active.|$|E

5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the World War I, he became the subject of anti-German attacks in the Press. In 1915, Speyer offered to resign from the Privy Council and to {{relinquish}} his baronetcy, but the Prime Minister turned down the offer. He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> during the war, and had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with his status as a British subject. Speyer denied the charges, but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the Privy Council.|$|E

5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not make contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia, {{and was a}} {{prominent}} figure on the social scene. During the summer of 1778, he met Peggy Shippen, the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen, a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city. Peggy had been courted by British Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia. Peggy and Arnold married on April 8, 1779. Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines, despite military bans on communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury, a Philadelphia merchant.|$|E
5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 12 March 1940. In April 1940 the squadron flew as escort for a De Havilland Flamingo carrying Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to Paris to attend a meeting after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Most of the unit's time during the Phoney War was consumed engaging in intensive training over the Wash which included co-operation with searchlights and mine-laying operations. It did not last for long. On 15 May 1940, 604 relocated to RAF Manston. From the airfield Cunningham flew sorties over the English Channel and patrols over Dunkirk as the Battle for France intensified. Cunningham made no recorded contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> and France capitulated on 25 June 1940.|$|E
5|$|Duke Frederick II of Austria, {{who arrived}} to assist Béla against the invaders, {{defeated}} a small Mongol troop near Pest. He seized prisoners, including Cumans from the Eurasian Steppes {{who had been}} forced to join the Mongols. When the citizens of Pest realized the presence of Cumans in the invading army, mass hysteria emerged. The townsfolk accused Köten and their Cumans of cooperating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> A riot broke out and the mob massacred Köten's retinue. Köten was either slaughtered or committed suicide. On hearing about Köten's fate, his Cumans decided to leave Hungary and destroyed many villages on their way towards the Balkan Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> movements; technical limitations {{made it difficult}} to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
