5|$|When {{talks to}} find an American {{broadcaster}} for Thunderbirds fell through in July 1966, production for the series' second season ended with the completion of just six episodes {{at the behest of}} ITC financier Lew Grade. Having overseen Gerry Anderson's work since the creation of Supercar in 1960 – and going on to buy his production company, AP Films, during the making of Fireball XL5 – Grade was enthusiastic for Anderson's programmes to be transmitted abroad, in the lucrative American market, and decided that a new concept <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to attract potential bidders than a second season of Thunderbirds.|$|E
25|$|The Czech coup, the PCF's failed {{policy of}} {{sabotage}} and the Marshall Plan's likely passage were all beginning to sway French public opinion. 70% of French people now believed the U.S. <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> {{than any other}} country to help France, compared to 7% who thought the USSR <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more.</b> Despite French concern about Germany, it was becoming increasingly clear that the Soviet threat was greater than the German. France would still seek an advantageous power position vis-à-vis Germany, but it was becoming reconciled to the prospect of a rehabilitated Germany as part of postwar Europe.|$|E

25|$|The {{summer of}} 1997 saw a Luton Town {{teenager}} {{with only two}} games under his belt, Matthew Upson, sold to Arsenal for £2million. To make matters worse, star forward Tony Thorpe was sold to Kevin Keegan's Fulham for £800,000. Just one place off the bottom of Division Two on deadline day, Luton looked doomed – but David Pleat, now Tottenham's Director of Football, handed Luton a lifeline – Rory Allen, who {{had just returned from}} injury, was sent on loan to the club to complete his recovery and fill Thorpe's boots Allen <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than that, scoring six goals in his eight matches to keep Luton up.|$|E

25|$|A {{systematic}} review {{reported that there}} is some evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% or 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth reduces the frequency of dry socket. Another {{systematic review}} concluded that there is evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of dry socket (and infection and pain) following third molar extractions of wisdom teeth, however their use is associated with an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. The authors questioned whether treating 12 patients with antibiotics to prevent one infection <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> harm overall than good, in view of the potential side effects and also of antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, there is evidence that in individuals who are at clear risk may benefit from antibiotics. There is also evidence that antifibrinolytic agents applied to the socket after the extraction may reduce the risk of dry socket.|$|E
500|$|Although Southard {{expressed}} {{a great deal}} of interest in research, he was most inclined to work on the classification, nomenclature and definition of psychiatric and philosophical concepts. He said he realized that such work was ridiculed by many, but a [...] "psychiatric dictionary (to include definitions of every near-lying psychological and philosophical term also) <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to push mental hygiene on than any other single thing I can think of." [...] Southard proposed an eleven-category classification system for psychiatric diagnoses, which was not adopted.|$|E
500|$|Burnet's {{essays and}} books {{published}} {{in his later}} life caused contention within the scientific community and {{to the chagrin of}} his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for The Lancet entitled [...] "Men or Molecules?" [...] in which he questioned the usefulness of molecular biology, arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as [...] "a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology." ...|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{nothing in}} David's reign compares in {{importance}} to burghs. While they could not, at first, have amounted to {{much more than}} the nucleus of an immigrant merchant class, nothing <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to reshape the long-term economic and ethnic shape of Scotland than the burgh. These planned towns were or became English in culture and language; William of Newburgh wrote in the reign of King William the Lion, that [...] "the towns and burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by English"; as well as transforming the economy, the failure of these towns to go native would in the long term undermine the position of the native Scottish language and give birth to the idea of the Scottish Lowlands.|$|E
500|$|John S. Barbour Jr. of the Piedmont’s Culpeper County was {{the first}} Unionist to break away into the secessionist camp. While “resolutely {{protecting}} slave labor” he was for encouraging manufacturing and commercial interests in Virginia against those of the North. He asked what <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to promote Virginia's growth, participation “in a hostile confederacy in which your [...] power will be but 11 out of 150 , or in a friendly confederacy {{where it will be}} 21 out of 89 ?” In the South was a government to join [...] "in full working order, strong, powerful and efficient ..." [...] Henry A. Wise tried to move the Convention into a [...] "Spontaneous Southern Rights Convention" [...] to immediately install a secessionist government in Virginia, but on April 4, almost two-thirds of the Convention voted against secession, and a three-man delegation was sent to consult with Lincoln who had resolved to protect Federal property in the South.|$|E
500|$|In his widely reprinted piece [...] "Shall We Compromise", Beecher assailed the Compromise of 1850, a {{compromise}} between anti-slavery and pro-slavery forces brokered by Whig Senator Henry Clay. The compromise banned slavery from California and slave-trading from Washington, D.C. {{at the cost of}} a stronger Fugitive Slave Act; Beecher objected to the last provision in particular, arguing that it was a Christian's duty to feed and shelter escaped slaves. Slavery and liberty were fundamentally incompatible, Beecher argued, making compromise impossible: [...] "One or the other must die". In 1856, Beecher campaigned for abolitionist John C. Frémont, the first presidential candidate of the Republican Party; despite Beecher's aid, Frémont lost to Democrat James Buchanan. During the pre-Civil-War conflict in the Kansas Territory, known as [...] "Bloody Kansas", Beecher raised funds to send Sharps rifles to abolitionist forces, stating that the weapons <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> good than [...] "a hundred Bibles". The press subsequently nicknamed the weapons [...] "Beecher's Bibles". Beecher became widely hated in the American South for his abolitionist actions and received numerous death threats.|$|E

500|$|Churchill's {{view was}} that Coward <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> for the war effort by {{entertaining}} the troops and the home front than by intelligence work: [...] "Go and sing to them when the guns are firing – that's your job!" [...] Coward, though disappointed, followed this advice. He toured, acted and sang indefatigably in Europe, Africa, Asia and America. He wrote and recorded war-themed popular songs, including [...] "London Pride" [...] and [...] "Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans". His London home was wrecked by German bombs in 1941, and he took up temporary residence at the Savoy Hotel. During one air raid on {{the area around the}} Savoy he joined Carroll Gibbons and Judy Campbell in impromptu cabaret to distract the captive guests from their fears. Another of Coward's wartime projects, as writer, star, composer and co-director (alongside David Lean), was the naval film drama In Which We Serve. The film was popular {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and he was awarded an honorary certificate of merit at the 1943 Academy Awards ceremony. Coward played a naval captain, basing the character on his friend Lord Louis Mountbatten. Lean went on to direct and adapt film versions of several Coward plays.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Hay Drummond, his archbishop, {{made clear}} his dislike of Conyers's preaching in 1764, an opinion formed after hearing a visitation sermon at Malton, saying [...] "Were you to inculcate the {{morality}} of Socrates, it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> good than canting about the new birth". But Conyers was favoured by William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth. The Duncombe family restored the chapel at Sproxton, just south of Helmsley, in 1765.|$|E

2500|$|The {{combination}} of extreme weather conditions, Western attempts at colonizing China and growing anti-imperialist sentiment fueled the movement. First, a drought followed by floods in Shandong province in 1897–1898 forced farmers {{to flee to}} cities and seek food.

2500|$|Perhaps {{nothing in}} David's reign compares in {{importance}} to this.
