Ducks dotted the glassy surface of the lakes; a blue heron stood motionless on a water-gate; kingfishers darted with shrieking flight along the shady banks; a <b>white</b> <b>hawk</b> sailed above; and from the trees and shrubs came the song of robins and cat-birds. It was all in strange contrast to the endless slopes of lonely sage and the wild rock environs beyond.

5000|$|The 09/10 {{season was}} a Jekyll and Hyde one for The <b>White</b> <b>Hawks,</b> they were {{virtually}} unbeatable at home yet struggled to take points away. Despite this they finished {{the regular season}} in a very impressive 3rd behind the 2 favorites SønderjyskE & AaB. 3rd giving them home advantage in the quarter finals they choose to play Rødovre again for the 3rd straight year. Some experts doubted they could progress saying [...] "The <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> can't win away so all Rødovre {{needs to do is}} win 1 game away and they will win the series". This series {{would turn out to be}} another classic, Rødovre won the first 2 games despite the <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> dominating the first, the 3rd game saw an impressive come from behind win by The <b>White</b> <b>Hawks.</b> The series was really decided with the <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> away win in the 4th game, a game that saw a goal scored by <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> goalkeeper Frederik Andersen. Andersen had tried to score in game 3 after Rødovre pulled their keeper but just missed, in game 4 he made sure of his aim and scored in the empty net. The <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> went on to win a close game 5 and then game 7 easily. They were then put out in the semifinals after just 4 games by a dominant SønderjyskE who progressed to easily beat AaB in the finals in only 4 games to claim another championship.

5000|$|... 2009 {{saw them}} seeded 7th. If {{not for the}} {{bankruptcy}} of Hvidovre they would have finished 8th and probably faced Herning and forced their local rivals AaB out of the finals by 1 goal differential. However Hvildovre's bankruptcy left an open slot for AaB and put the <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> up a place to face Rødovre (second seed) again in the quarter finals. This was also a very close series with the <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> winning three games over the much favored Rødovre, and pushing them to game 7 again. Rødovre won game 7 fairly easily, but the decisive moment was really Rødovre's overtime win in game 4, without which the <b>White</b> <b>Hawks</b> would have progressed after winning game 6. Rødovre went on to lose the semi finals to SønderjyskE who beat Herning in the finals.|$|R
