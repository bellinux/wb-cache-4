40|$|The 5 -HT 1 A agonist 8 -OH-DPAT, at {{a dose of}} 30 micrograms/kg, {{enhanced}} the consumption of sweetened <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> and sweetened milk in non-deprived rats. In partially satiated rats, sensitivity to the hyperphagic effect of 8 -OH-DPAT on <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> intake was substantially increased, so that the minimally effective dose was reduced to 3 micrograms/kg. Similarly, 8 -OH-DPAT was more efficacious in increasing milk intake in satiated rats. Thus, 30 and 40 micrograms/kg 8 -OH-DPAT produced a 4 -fold increase of milk intake in completely satiated rats compared to a 2 -fold increase in partially satiated animals at a dose of 30 micrograms/kg. The increased intake of liquid and <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> diets observed after treatment with low doses of 8 -OH-DPAT argues against the involvement of non-specific gnawing in the increased consumption of solid food produced by the drug. Rather, the data suggest that 8 -OH-DPAT may specifically stimulate appetite by counteracting a tonic serotonergic inhibition of feeding. The present experiments also showed that 8 -OH-DPAT attenuates fenfluramine-induced anorexia which is thought to depend on increased serotonergic neurotransmission...|$|E

40|$|Nineteen rats were {{maintained}} throughout the experiment on ad libitum <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> {{and water and}} were trained to press a lever on fixed-interval or fixed-ratio schedules of reinforcement with electrical brain stimulation. Fourteen rats ate at least 150 % more mash during intermittent reinforcement sessions than during baseline, massed reinforcement control, and/or extinction sessions. In a 3 -hr session, 11 of those 14 consumed more than 22 g of <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> (13 g dry weight), the equivalent of nearly half an animal's daily food intake. In subsequent control sessions, the electrodes did not support stimulus-bound eating despite attempts to make stimulation parameters optimal.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} cost {{of conventional}} feeds {{calls for the}} unconventional ones. The effect of Allzyme®SSF and diet physical form on performance, haematological and serum biochemical indices of growing pigs fed with palm kernel meal-based diet was determined. Twenty four growing pigs comprising of twelve male and twelve female weighing 8. 95 ± 1. 01 Kg were assigned into four dietary treatment groups involving dry mash diet, <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> diet, dry mash diet+ Allzyme®SSF and <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> diet+ Allzyme®SSF in a completely randomized design. After feeding experiment for six weeks, haematological and serum biochemical parameters were determined. Growth performance was observed {{on a weekly basis}} for six consecutive weeks. The results showed that the diet physical form and Allzyme®SSF supplementation in a palm kernel meal-based diet did not significantly affect the haematological and serum biochemical parameters; however weight gain and feed conversion ratio were significantly influenced by the diet physical form and Allzyme®SSF supplementation, thus making dry mash diet + Allzyme®SSF the best dietary treatment. The experiment showed that the diet physical form and Allzyme®SSF supplementation in a palm kernel meal-based diet did not have any negative effect on the growing pigs and growth performance was not hindered; therefore palm kernel meal-based diet in wet or dry mash form with or without Allzyme ® SSF supplementation could be fed to growing pigs...|$|E

40|$|Taste {{thresholds}} for {{the bitter}} compound sucrose octaacetate (SOA) were elevated by desalivation in mice. Thresholds were determined for control and experimental animals {{both before and}} after ligation of all salivary ducts. There was a significant increase in SOA thresholds in the desalivate mice, and the pre- to post-operative differences in threshold between the control and experimental groups were significant. The altered response to SOA by desalivate mice is shown to be due to the assumption of a prandial pattern of drinking as a result of desalivation. This conclusion is based on experiments with <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> which failed to show any differences in threshold between the same control and desalivate mice that demonstrated a significant difference when tested on fluids and dry pellets...|$|E
40|$|Six hundred day-old Pekin and Muscovy male ducklings {{were raised}} on diets based {{exclusively}} on food wastes to market ages of 7 and 11 weeks, respectively. Three dietary treatments were {{offered to the}} birds: commercial pellets (control), feeds consisting partially of food waste, and feeds consisting entirely of food waste. The two experimental treatments each had a dry pelleted diet and a <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> diet. Twenty-four carcasses from each breed were analyzed {{to determine the effects}} of the experimental diets compared to those of the control (commercial pellets). In addition to corn and soybean meal, a total of nine food waste ingredients were tested. The precise-feeding technique was performed to establish DM, fat, and fibre digestibility as well as N retention, AME, AMEn, TME, TMEn values for the 11 feedstuff ingredients. The results of this study provide reliable data for formulation of duck diets using the tested food waste ingredients as well as corn and soybean meal in both Pekin and Muscovy ducklings at 2 different ages during growth.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{was carried out in}} order to explore further the possibility that hungry rats, both mature and weanling, might learn to associate flavours with different sizes of meals made from the same diet. The general procedure used involved providing rats with either a large meal (e. g. 5 gm). usually consisting of <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> with an added flavour such as anise, or a small meal (e. g. 1 gm) of the same diet with a second flavour such as vanilla added, on alternate days. Following a number of such discrimination training days, subjects were given a two-jar extinction choice test to assess their relative preferences for the two flavours. It was originally anticipated that rats would come to prefer the flavour associated with the larger meal (i. e., conditioned appetite), because the larger meal provided more calories. However, this result was never obtained. When a significant preference was acquired, this was for the flavour of the small meal instead, (i. e. conditioned satiety). The conditioned effects not only extinguished very rapidly but were also rather elusive at times. It is thought that the observed conditioned satiety effects were probably due to flavour-calorie rather than flavour-flavour associations. ...|$|E
40|$|In Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica; n = 9), the doubly labeled water (DLW) method (2 H, 18 O) for {{estimation}} of CO 2 production (l/day) was validated. To evaluate its sensitivity to water efflux levels (rH 2 Oe; g/day) and to assumptions of fractional evaporative water loss (x; dimensionless), animals were repeatedly fed a dry pellet diet (average rH 2 Oe of 34. 8 g/day) or a <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> diet (95. 8 g/day). We simultaneously compared the novel infrared laser spectrometry (LS) with isotope ratio mass spectrometry. At low rH 2 Oe, calculated CO 2 production rate exhibited little sensitivity to assumptions concerning x, {{with the best}} fit being found at 0. 51, and only little error was made employing an x value of 0. 25. In contrast, at high rH 2 Oe, sensitivities were much higher with the best fit at x = 0. 32. Conclusions derived from isotope ratio mass spectrometry and LS were similar, proving the usefulness of LS. Within a threefold range of rH 2 Oe, little error in the DLW method is made when assuming one single x value of 0. 25, indicating its robustness in comparative studies. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} wet feeding {{with or without}} {{drinking}} water on rectal temperature, respiratory rate, behavioural pattern (panting, eating and resting), haematological and serum biochemistry of broilers was investigated. Seventy (70), six weeks old broilers {{were used for the}} study. The treatments consist of: Conventional dry mash and <b>Wet</b> <b>mash</b> with varying amounts of water addition (1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 parts of water to 1 part of feed) with or without drinking water. Mixing was done at the time of feeding. Results showed that there was no significant relationship between behavioural pattern (panting, eating and resting) and feeding form in the morning (p> 0. 05, X 2 = 0. 52), afternoon (p> 0. 05, X 2 = 3. 28) and evening (p> 0. 05, X 2 = 0. 94). Respiratory rate was significantly (p 0. 05) affected by feeding form. Heamatological indices did not show any significant (p> 0. 05) variation with the application of wet feed with or without drinking water.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 8 -OH-DPAT {{treatment}} on rat grooming behaviour, elicited either prandially or {{in response to}} spraying with water were investigated. Dose (≤ 0. 1 mg/kg s. c.) response studies employed momentary time sampling over 30 or 60 min with behaviour being scored in one of 6 or 7 (depending on food availability) mutually exclusive categories (feeding, active, scratching, face-grooming, body grooming, genital-grooming and resting) at 15 s intervals. In non-deprived rats, tested with <b>wet</b> <b>mash</b> available, feeding and activity frequencies were increased, but resting and total grooming were inhibited by 8 -OH-DPAT. Face-, body- and genital-grooming occurred at higher levels than scratching, but all categories were reduced with reductions in scratching occurring at a lower dose (0. 01 mg/kg). Misting rats with a fine water spray selectively increased body grooming and decreased activity without altering feeding, while 8 -OH-DPAT increased feeding and reduced face-, body- and genital-grooming, without affecting already low levels of scratching. In misted rats, tested without food, 8 -OH-DPAT reduced face-, body- and genital-grooming and increased resting. These results confirm i) that the water spray technique is a useful method for increasing grooming and ii) that 8 -OH-DPAT has a suppressant effect on grooming independent of response competition from enhanced feeding...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{pharmaceutical}} {{interest for}} the endocannabinoid system as a target for antiobesity therapies has been restricted by the severe adverse effects of the CB 1 antagonist rimonabant. This study points at oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a monounsaturated analogue, and functional antagonist of anandamide, as a potential and safer antiobesity alternative to CB 1 antagonism. Mice treated with equal doses (5 or 10 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) of OEA or rimonabant were analyzed for the progressive expression of spontaneous behaviors (eating, grooming, rearing, locomotion, and resting) occurring during the development of satiety, according to the paradigm called behavioral satiety sequence (BSS). Both drugs reduced food (<b>wet</b> <b>mash)</b> intake to a similar extent. OEA treatment decreased eating activity within the first 30 [*]min and caused a temporary increase of resting time that was not accompanied by any decline of horizontal, vertical and total motor activity. Besides decreasing eating activity, rimonabant caused a marked increase of the time spent grooming and decreased horizontal motor activity, alterations that might be indicative of aversive nonmotivational effects on feeding. These results {{support the idea that}} OEA suppresses appetite by stimulating satiety and that its profile of action might be predictive of safer effects in humans as a novel antiobesity treatment...|$|E

40|$|A 3 x 2 {{factorial}} {{experimental design}} was adopted {{to investigate the}} effect of varying dietary protein levels (optimum = 19. 64 %, low = 17. 72 % and high = 21. 52 %) offered on dry and wet forms on the performance and carcass traits of broiler finishers. The diets were isocaloric and gave energy to protein ratio of 148. 36, 164. 23 and 135. 15. The wet feed was constituted at 1 : 1 w/v of feed and water. One hundred and eighty started chicken broilers were randomly allocated to the three dietary protein levels in wet and dry feed forms at 10 birds per replicate and 3 replicates per treatment. Feed and water were provided ad libitum throughout the 4 -week feeding trial. Feeding of diets of varying dietary protein levels (17. 72 – 21. 52 %) had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on the final live weight, feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio and water intake of the broiler chickens. Broiler chickens on wet feed had higher (P 0. 05) for performance parameters measured. Carcass traits were not significantly (P> 0. 05) influenced by the treatments.
