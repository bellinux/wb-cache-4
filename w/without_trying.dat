Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E

Nash views the collection as simultaneously promoting the study and understanding of both women and anthropology.|$|E
25|$|The {{reported}} {{reasons for}} self-harm {{differ from the}} reasons for suicide attempts. Nearly 70% of people with BPD self-harm <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> to end their life. Reasons for self-harm include expressing anger, self-punishment, generating normal feelings (often in response to dissociation), and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances. In contrast, suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others {{will be better off}} following the suicide. Both suicide and self-harm are a response to feeling negative emotions. Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{approach}} these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control seeks to reduce the heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> to convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E

500|$|The Coens {{are known}} for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a {{relatively}} straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls [...] "a pretty savage film". Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.|$|E

Hassett fell after being beaten in flight by Young. [...] Aiming to break Young's {{restrictive}} leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Washbrook at wide mid-off. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps, with their personal tallies on 23 and 48 respectively. The run rate {{picked up in the}} last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time.|$|E
500|$|David Scheffer, {{director}} of the Northwestern University School of Law Center for International Human Rights, said the fact that bin Laden had previously been indicted in 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for conspiracy to attack U.S. defense installations was a complicating factor. [...] "Normally when an individual is under indictment {{the purpose is to}} capture that person in order to bring him to court to try him... The object is not to literally summarily execute him if he's under indictment." [...] Scheffer and another expert stated {{that it was important to}} determine whether the mission was to capture bin Laden or to kill him. If the Navy SEALs were instructed to kill bin Laden <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> first to capture him, it [...] "may have violated American ideals if not international law." ...|$|E

Scott praised the film for striking a balance between humor and sentimentality, writing, [...] "It's both funny and serious <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> too hard to be either, and by trying above all to be honest." [...] Peter Debruge described Jenny Slate as [...] "wildly funny" [...] in Variety, while Marc Mohan called her performance [...] "endearing and real" [...] in The Oregonian. The Hollywood Reporter Todd McCarthy was also impressed by Slate's performance and opined that the supporting cast members were equally impressive.|$|E

[...] While the tracks [...] "Don't Go Away" [...] and [...] "The Girl in the Dirty Shirt" [...] were described as unabashedly sentimental, Du Noyer went on to observe that [...] "there is compassion and sensitivity in these tracks that is not the work of oafs." [...] Du Noyer conceded that Noel often tied himself up in [...] "cosmic knots", but had [...] "written words that sound simple and true, and are therefore poetic <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> to be."

500|$|The order {{resulted}} {{in the death of}} both Waldmann and his wingman Schrey on the following mission. Waldmann was killed following a mid-air collision with Leutnant Hans-Dieter Weihs shortly after takeoff, and Schrey was killed in combat with US fighters. Mindful of the direct order of the Reichsmarschall, Oberleutnant Grünberg (1st Staffel), Oberleutnant Fritz Stehle (2nd Staffel) and Waldmann (3rd Staffel) had decided that each of them would lead a flight of four Me 262s, taking off and flying around for an hour before returning <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> to engage the enemy. Grünberg's Schwarm took off first followed by Stehle's Schwarm. Waldmann chose Weihs, as the most experienced pilot trained in instrument flight, to lead the Schwarm, while Schrey once again served as Waldmann's wingman. Waldmann's Me 262 A-1 [...] "Yellow 3" [...] (Werknummer 117097—factory number) took off at 12:24 and Weihs ordered the Schwarm to form a close formation, flying wing tip to wing tip.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, stating that the band seemed more settled and comfortable while [...] "accentuating the big riffs and bigger emotions, crafting songs without a worry as to whether they're hip or not and, most importantly, enjoying the deep-rooted, nervy arena rock that is uniquely their own." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album four out of five stars, commenting that while [...] "some key sounds and sensibilities" [...] and uplifting lyrics were unlike Pearl Jam's earlier style, the music in Lightning Bolt marked a return to the [...] "thick-bottomed rhythms, hard-nosed guitars and darkened tone of classic Pearl Jam" [...] compared to predecessor Backspacer. Cole Waterman of PopMatters gave the album an eight out of ten, praising [...] "Pearl Jam thriving in their persona, building on what worked in the past <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> to copy it while adding new elements to the mix" [...] and feeling that despite [...] "the closing songs get monotonous in their united balladry", [...] "Future Days" [...] was a good album closer, comparing it to Tom Waits.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} {{able to have a}} little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun <b>without</b> <b>trying</b> all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E
