We claim that, while objective data on product attributes (e.g., the clock speed of a processor) is easy to obtain, subjective information on these attributes (e.g., <b>what</b> <b>users</b> <b>think</b> about the speed of this processor) are much harder to gather and to keep updated.|$|E
30|$|Password reuse {{has been}} {{identified}} as a common [1], but troubling user behavior that leaves many vulnerable to a broad range of attacks [10, 11]. To address this problem, password managers are designed to reduce or eliminate password reuse across multiple accounts and devices through lightweight password generation and management features that allow users to create random, unique passwords across their accounts while only needing to remember the password to their password manager to access those accounts. If properly utilized, a password manager can help users stay secure without increasing their cognitive burden through arduous memorization, and so many experts recommend users take up the tool [2, 8]. Thus, this study investigates <b>what</b> <b>users</b> <b>think</b> of these tools towards understanding why some choose to use them while others do not.|$|E

In previous evaluations, we received very positive feedback from our users about this visual methodology. Users found the approach understandable and useful. So far, the ImageNotion methodology supports {{for the sake}} of simplicity only three kinds of relations: broader, narrower and unnamed relations. We were interested, however, whether users would find it useful to have more kinds of relations, which would also make our ontology more expressive. We therefore evaluated in an online survey <b>what</b> <b>users</b> <b>think</b> of this issue. The evaluation was based on the publicly available online prototype of the system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to find out}} if {{augmented}} reality can improve people’s knowledge about archaeology. First of all there is some research about what augmented reality is and the technology {{that can be used to}} create a successful augmented reality application. Augmented reality as it is often used on smartphones in the form of layar applications can be seen some sort of pseudo augmented reality, while real augmented reality applications require much more advanced technology to integrate virtual objects into real world images, and to make more precise tracking possible. Furthermore there are some projects that combine archaeology and augmented reality described in this thesis, with the purpose of finding out which techniques are used and <b>what</b> <b>users</b> <b>think</b> of these techniques and the augmented reality applications in general. Most augmented reality applications have been evaluated, but these evaluations were mostly technical, to find out if an application worked correctly and if there was any room for improvement. There is little information about user experiences with augmented reality applications and the techniques they use. It is only known that people like augmented reality because it is fun and new. There has also been some research into other possibilities of combining archaeology and augmented reality. There are plenty of these possibilities, since most augmented reality applications today are pseudo augmented reality applications, fast to create and cheap layar applications on smartphones. There still are a lot of possibilities in creating real augmented reality applications that integrate virtual objects instead of superimposing them on real world images. These augmented reality applications should also be more focused on archaeology instead of consisting for a large part of historical data...|$|E

40|$|The {{philosophy}} {{behind the}} HyBIS instrument {{is to develop}} a technological solution that addresses the specific requirements of the user. Rather than provide a comprehensive engineering capability in a single system (e. g. an ROV), we used the specific scientific needs of the user to inform the design and development of the technology. The result is surprising: a versatile technology, modular in design, that has a low capital cost and is relatively easy to operate. We believe that this approach is both efficient and cost effective. For a fraction of the capital and running cost of a conventional ROV, the HyBIS system meets many of the users' needs. Ensuring that excess capacity and common formats are designed in from the start, the instrument can be easily expanded and developed to meet future requirements. Key to the success of this approach is knowing exactly <b>what</b> the <b>user</b> needs and distinguishing this from <b>what</b> the <b>user</b> <b>thinks</b> they want. This requires a bi-lateral process of information flow: educating both the engineer and the user so that each knows what can be achieved and what is actually required...|$|R

However, unlike the document interface paradigm of the World Wide Web (WWW), these online games have more stringent requirements that are not fulfilled by the Internet’s best effort service model.

Consequently, the volatile nature of the Internet can affect the enjoyment of all, {{or at the very least}} a few, of the users. To ameliorate the impact caused by network problems that may arise during game play, game developers have adopted adaptation techniques in the design and implementation of online games.

They expect a continued pattern of decline unless some possible measures undertaken to curb the problem. Respondents are, for most part, supportive of management. Most of them understand the importance of the variables that management can manipulate and agree on some fundamental element of a common management strategy but lack incentive for compliance due to the absence of property right. Moreover, they showed motivation and willingness to share management responsibility with fisheries officials. Consolidation of the community coupled with local control of resource base access and active involvement in the management thereof, are important ingredients for achieving true success – i. e. long term sustainability – in the exploitation of the fishery resources...|$|R

What kind of information do households really want on their bills? <b>What</b> do <b>users</b> <b>think</b> of the information they get on the bill today?

How important is it whether the bill is based on actual readings of electricity use and not just on preliminary estimates? The experience of Swedish households indicates that the information included in the electricity bill is difficult to understand. Most customers feel that it is important that the bill is based on current readings of electricity usage. The electricity bills are not coming frequently enough to enable the households to relate their usage of electricity to habits and behaviour in everyday life. Historical information on the household’s electricity usage could be added to the information in the bill to make such relations between electricity consumption and habits visible, although there are some limitations due to the format of the bills. The cost of the feedback is also an obstacle since neither the sender of the bill nor the receiver is willing to pay for the information...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in question examines whether a newspaper benefits from its {{activity on the}} Internet and if so - how. Today, the morning press is relatively stable, but tendencies show that there’s a decrease amongst regular readers. The extension of this may jeopardize {{the position of the}} morning newspapers in the market and several newspapers choose to publish their content on the Internet. An Internet activity is foremost about keeping the position in the market, not to make an economical profit, and to compete at the same terms with free newspapers and news sites. Later, advertisers have drawn their attention to the Internet which means that the conditions of financing a webpage are improving. As a part of the paper, we have been commissioned by the editor in chief at the Nya Wermlands-Tidningen, Staffan Ander, to investigate how their website currently is presented, <b>what</b> the <b>users</b> <b>think</b> of the website and what the future possibilities are for the website. The results are based on a questionnaire that 345 subscribers participated in. Thus isn’t the results representative for the whole readership of the Nya Wermlands-Tidningen. There are tendencies that articulate that there is a vague interest in the website in its current form. This is derived from the subscribers’ opinion that the website is superfluous in its current state and that the website is poorly marketed, which could explain the lack of interest. The conclusions are that the Nya-Wermlands-Tidningen at the moment is unthreatened as the leading newspaper in the county, but it’s a good investment in the long-term to further develop the website partly to get hold of the younger generation of readers who doesn’t have a strong tradition of reading newspapers.

BY ABBAS MOALLEM og-in and sign-in pages are important components of most commercial Web sites. Through log-in pages, users can enter data for an application, perform daily tasks, access content, place orders, or view their accounts or the status of their orders. A user might log in to several sites for a variety of reasons. For example, one might log in to a bank Web site to perform transactions, to a brokerage account to trade stocks, or to an e-mail account to view or send e-mails. Consequently, one might log in more than 10 times in a typical day. The information that users enter on various log-in and sign-in pages is almost identical: their usernames and pass-words. Occasionally (sometimes frequently), users forget their usernames or passwords and must either get help to remember them or ask for their information to be reset. Even though the components of log-in or sign-in pages seem to be almost identical, there are important inconsisten-cies and differences among commercial and public Web sites, making the user's task more complicated. These include the vocabulary, the physical attributes of the objects, and the configuration of the pages. Besides forgetting their different usernames and passwords, users often must select a different username or password based on the security requirements of each site (Krause 2003; Sasse, Brostoff, & Weirich 2001). To improve and standardize the log-in page, it is important to investigate current design and user preferences in this domain.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to provide}} certain lines {{of work for}} reading promotion in public libraries. It seeks to document and analyze a successful experience of reading promotion {{in order to identify}} best practices that can be replicated in other contexts. This study case focuses on the reading promotion service called "Casero del Libro" (market seller of books), driven by the Municipal Library of Miraflores in Lima. Variables related to reading practices and the service provided and their impact on the target audience, market sellers, are analyzed. It seeks to distinguish the characteristics of a reading promotion service of a public library so that it is more accessible to its public; it seeks to synthesize the best practices of this particular service. The overall objective of the research is to understand the main characteristics of a successful experience of reading promotion developed in a public library in Lima; while specific objectives are to identify the most relevant strategies of reading promotion employed in this experience and to identify the changes in reading habits of the users of this service. The research begins with the following research questions: What are the objectives of a reading promotion service in non-traditional places offered by a public library? What are the main features that should have a reading promotion service to be successful in Lima, Peru? What strategies were used {{in the creation of the}} reading promotion service? What strategies could be replicated to promote reading? Why users participate in the service? <b>What</b> do <b>users</b> <b>think</b> about the reading promotion service? Have they changed their reading habits during the years of service? <b>What</b> do <b>users</b> <b>think</b> about books and reading? We worked with the following assumptions: • The public library approaches its potential users through reading promotion services in non-traditional places, while doing so it accomplishes two goals: to instill reading habits in adults and to attract adults and their families to the library. • The most important strategies to promote reading in adults are focused on a personalized service and the use of oral language as motivators for reading. • Users participate in this service because reading is useful for them, on a personal and family level, as in the workplace. In summary, all proposed hypotheses are true, except that in this study case, the library fails to attract new users for its institution, meaning the users of the service "Casero del Libro" only use the service, but do not go to the library after that. The research is qualitative; interviews with users and librarians (managers and service librarians) were performed. Qualitative methodology was chosen because with this work seeks to understand the perceptions of the different actors of the service and this methodology allows to collect the wealth of imagination, opinions and points of view of people. Interviews were conducted with 19 market sellers and 5 librarians during 2008 and 2013 in Lima. The main limitation of this study is that since a qualitative methodology was used, this case study includes only the experience among actors of this service. The first chapter presents a theoretical review of the concepts of reading, reading habits, reading promotion and public library; Peruvian statistics on the subject are also provided. The second chapter presents the international background of the reading promotion service "Casero del Libro", a brief history and context of the Municipal Library of Miraflores and the "Casero del Libro" service developed in Santa Cruz (Miraflores).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the level of knowledge internet users have about the regulation of the Social Networking System (SNS) in China and identify how much and in what ways regulation affects the way SNS systems are used. This project is based on qualitative methods. Its findings may be utilised to give an indication of <b>what</b> internet <b>users</b> <b>think</b> about the regulated SNS in China. The research employs two data collection methods : focus groups and interviews. Focus groups enable the researcher to assess overall trends and identify other issues the researcher had not already considered. Interviews enable the searcher to conduct a more in-depth exploration of the research topic and allow participants who might feel uneasy in the focus group to express sensitive opinions. The thesis finds that perceptions of internet users surrounding internet regulation can be separated the two groups: some internet users oppose internet regulation on SNS, and some support internet regulation on SNS. In the first group, the internet users hoped the internet in China could be visited without any censorship. They were aware that the Chinese government wants to create the world’s largest intranet in order to control public information. Also, they complained that the standards of censorship in China were not clear. In addition, the participants admired the free internet in Western countries. However, some internet users were prepared to tolerate government regulations. These users were more likely to self-regulate online. These internet users felt they were helpless and had no choice except observing government regulations. In another group, the internet users supported the internet regulation in China. They could understand why the government had to control online speech, in order to avoid “terrorists” using the internet to incite people to rise up against the government. However, some users in this group complied with Chinese internet regulations in appearance but opposed them in their minds...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the willingness to}} pay among readers of Danish online news providers. In an online survey, respondents are asked whether they pay, whether they intent to pay {{in the future and}} why they have decided to pay or not to pay. Furthermore, the respondents are asked to consider, which types of content and presentations of the news that would make them more likely to pay for online news, and they are asked questions regarding their opinion about the prices for online news as well. The questionnaire is supplemented by interviews with few of the respondents to answer further, <b>what</b> the <b>users</b> <b>think</b> about the paywalls as a whole, why they have decided to pay or not to pay and what could change their willingness to pay. Overall, quite few respondents have paid for online news so far, but a reasonably larger group is considering paying in the future. The biggest reason not to pay is the possibilities to find similar news and articles for free on other websites, as well as the fact that the respondents are not ready to pay for something, they could get for free in the past. Throughout the examinations, the majority of the respondents and interviewees ask for more unique articles as well as more in-depth articles to compete with the free options. As the thesis shows, the news medias still have a task in hand to develop their products even more, and simple tasks such as informing about the difference between paid articles and the rest is still a major issue that the media {{will have to deal with}} if they want further future success with the paywalls. All in all though, there is a reason to be optimistic, as the willingness to pay for digital content overall is growing, and it might just be a matter of time before the main part of news consumers are used to paying for online news, if only the news providers are able to keep developing their content to stand out from what has been – and is being – given away for free...|$|R

When police officers are conducting interviews with children, some of the disclosures can be quite shocking. This can make it difficult for an officer to maintain their composure without subtly indicating their shock to the child, which can in turn impede the information acquisition process. Using a robotic interviewer could eliminate this problem as the behaviours and expressions of the robot can be consciously controlled. To date research investigating the potential of Robot-Mediated Interviews has focused on establishing whether children will respond to robots in an interview scenario and if so how well. The results of these studies indicate that children will talk to a robot in an interview scenario in a similar way to which they talk to a human interviewer. However, in order to test if this approach would work in a real world setting, it is important to establish what the experts (e. g. specialist child interviewers) would require from the system. To determine the needs of the users we conducted a user panel with a group of potential real world users to gather their views of our current system and find out what they would require for the system to be useful to them. The user group we worked with consisted of specialist child protection police officers based in the UK. The findings from this panel suggest that a Robot-Mediated Interviewing system would need to be more flexible than our current system in order to respond to unpredictable situations and paths of investigation. This paper gives an insight into <b>what</b> real world <b>users</b> would need from a Robot-Mediated Interviewing system...|$|R

The design science research method has been selected as scientific method. A product in form of a positional voice chat library has been constructed. This library has been integrated into the existing game engine and its usage has been evaluated by the game’s end users. Results show a positional voice system that in theory supports up to 12500 simultaneous users can be built from scratch and be patched into an existing game in less than 600 man-hours. The system needs third-party libraries for threading, audio input/output, audio compression, network communication and mathematics. All libraries used in the project are free for use in commercial products and do not demand code using them become open source. Based on a survey taken by more than 200 users, the product received good ratings on Quality of Experience and most <b>users</b> <b>think</b> having a positional voice chat in a game like Mortal Online is important. Results show a trend of young and less experienced users giving the highest average ratings on quality, usefulness and importance of the positional voice chat, suggesting it may be a good tool to attract new players to a game...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study exploring the views of charitable beneficiaries on literature that is designed to appeal to donors. Ethical questions raised by using images of beneficiaries in fundraising materials have been a matter of debate for some time, but such debates normally only include the opinions of ‘powerful’ voices such as charity leaders, moral philosophers and media commentators. This research extends the parameters of the debate by canvassing the opinions of those depicted, to ask: <b>what</b> do <b>users</b> <b>think</b> of the images of themselves found in fundraising appeals? The study is based on five focus groups attended by a total of 38 young people living in, or attending services at, homeless hostels in four English cities. Focus group participants were asked their opinion of an array of images of homelessness that had recently been used in fundraising campaigns run by major charities working in this field. The findings demonstrate that this group of beneficiaries are visually literate, familiar with how marketing works and largely supportive of methods that maximize income. They understood why charity marketing often makes use of contrived and simplified images to depict homelessness, and showed appreciation for the skills of fundraisers in balancing the accurate depiction of social problems with the need to generate enough donations to – literally, in most cases – provide a roof over their heads. However, participants also expressed a desire for fundraising imagery to ‘tell stories’ about how people find themselves in need of charitable assistance and how they can turn their lives around, so that potential donors can appreciate how others come to be in need of help. This preference for dynamic imagery andstorytelling was contrasted with ‘sympathy snapshots’: fundraising materials that simply show an image of beneficiaries at their lowest ebb. Our study participants preferred the use of images that elicit empathy in potential donors, rather than those that only attempt to arouse sympathy, as they hope people will decide to make a generous response {{as a result of a}} recognition of common humanity rather than through emotions such as guilt or pity. The paper concludes by noting that the images used in fundraising materials play a key role both in defining social issues and in attracting a public response to those issues. Therefore the representations of need that are promoted by charities matter to beneficiaries, and it is important to include their voice in debates about the content of fundraising appeals...|$|R
40|$|Students at Jönköping School of Engineering {{were given}} an {{assignment}} from Jönköping municipality, to evaluate their decision support system, QlikView. The students have also developed proposals for improvement with focus on usability. The Jönköpings municipality has currently got 11000 employees and consists of nine different administrations. The target group for QlikView is approximately 600 first-line managers. The intention of QlikView is that the users can get an overall picture of their business by having all information in just one system. The purpose of the thesis is to obtain a picture of <b>what</b> the <b>users</b> <b>think</b> about the system today and present relevant suggestions for improvement, which the Jönköping municipality can use when {{the introduction of the}} new version of QlikView takes place. The research questions that the study aims to answer are: • Has QlikView got a user friendly interface?• How can the interface be improved to become more user friendly? Theories that this work is based on is Jacob Nielsens ten usability principles and Ben Schneidermans eight golden rules. They are both well-known authors in the subject of interaction design. The thesis also deals with theories regarding how an evaluation should be performed and how you collect data in the most positive way. The evaluation is started with a questionnaire that was sent out to the employees who had been logged into the system the past six months, the students also carried out interviews with 6 first-line managers. The result from the questionnaire and the interviews is presented in both diagrams, tables and in running text. In the questionnaire, 44 % of the respondents thought that the usability in QlikView was low. Opinions that stood out were that the selections are marked in an unclear way and that respondents found it difficult to know how to use the system. The six interviewed persons agreed that they all wanted to have a search box instead of the search function that today is ”hidden”. The suggested improvements that are presented are based on theories and result from the questionnaire and interviews. The work ends with a discussion and a conclusion. The conclusion is that the Jönköping municipality should make some changes in terms of functions and layout to enhance the usability. The students hope that this work will help the Jönköping municipality in their new version of QlikView...|$|R

40|$|Web-based {{applications}} typically {{allow for}} {{many ways to}} accomplish a task, {{as well as many}} methods to navigate to the same place within a site. While <b>users</b> <b>think</b> {{this is a good thing}} (at least most of the time), we as testers find that this fact complicates matters, requiring that we look not only at <b>what</b> <b>users</b> do within an application but also at how they do it. This part of the “User Experience, Not Metrics ” article series discusses how to use Rational TestStudio to script and design suites to accommodate the many possible navigation paths users can choose to take, so that the results of a testing effort accurately represent user experience. Stress-testing experts may argue that this level of detail in test script development is just extra work and doesn’t add value to a project. I would agree with them [...] . if our objective were to conduct a stress test. In Part 1 of this series, stress tests are defined as “any combination of scripts that are played back at a high user load excluding user delays [...] . but are not valid for determining user experience. ” As you’ll recall from Part 1, the focus o...|$|R
