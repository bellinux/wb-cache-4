However, they managed to collect all ten items without penalties, with Helene and Raef bargaining well for the cow hide and obtaining a second-hand Santos orange juicer in the last few minutes, despite buying it for a fair price. Meanwhile, Renaissance's execution of the task was a shambles, as Jennifer paid little attention to the dossiers, deciding to straight to the market and thus resulting in the team being disorganised and making mistakes, such as buying the <b>wrong</b> <b>colour</b> of mosque alarm clock, while Jenny and Michael attempted to bribe a sports store so to sabotage Alpha's efforts.

It appears Worth had the charm or gravitas to overcome his clients' requests for the <b>wrong</b> <b>colour</b> or trimming. His son Jean Philippe later recalled: [...] "His practised eye discerned the color and style of robe that would most completely enhance a woman's charm, and with complete serenity she might leave the matter to him and give her mind to the contemplation of home affairs, her children and philanthropies".|$|E
60|$|In {{the tense}} hush which {{had fallen on}} {{the crowd at the}} {{restarting}} of the wheel, Sally's laugh rang out with an embarrassing clearness. It had a marked effect on all those within hearing. There is something almost of religious ecstasy in the deportment of the spectators at a table where anyone is having a run of luck at roulette, and if she had guffawed in a cathedral she could not have caused a more pained consternation. The earnest worshippers gazed at her with shocked eyes, and Ginger, turning with a start, saw her and jumped up. As he did so, the ball fell with a rattling click into a red compartment of the wheel; and, as it ceased to revolve and it was seen that at last the big winner had picked the <b>wrong</b> <b>colour,</b> a shuddering groan ran through the congregation like that which convulses the penitents' bench at a negro revival meeting. More glances of reproach were cast at Sally. It was generally felt that her injudicious behaviour had changed Ginger's luck.|$|E
60|$|But, perhaps, {{you will}} {{tell me that the}} {{external}} beauty of the world has almost entirely passed away from us, that the artist dwells no longer {{in the midst of the}} lovely surroundings which, in ages past, were the natural inheritance of every one, and that art is very difficult in this unlovely town of ours, where, as you go to your work in the morning, or return from it at eventide, you have to pass through street after street of the most foolish and stupid architecture that the world has ever seen; architecture, where every lovely Greek form is desecrated and defiled, and every lovely Gothic form defiled and desecrated, reducing three-fourths of the London houses to being, merely, like square boxes of the vilest proportions, as gaunt as they are grimy, and as poor as they are pretentious--the hall door always of the <b>wrong</b> <b>colour,</b> and the windows of the wrong size, and where, even when wearied of the houses you turn to contemplate the street itself, you have nothing to look at but chimney-pot hats, men with sandwich boards, vermilion letterboxes, and do that even at the risk of being run over by an emerald-green omnibus.|$|E

40|$|A {{printing}} {{firm has}} {{a large number of}} costumers, it is therefore important that documents are delivered in the right way, fulfilling all requirements. Unneccacery stops and quality problems are consequeses otherwise. The requirements are for example that right fonts should be included and that images should have the right resolution. Errors in the files are however very common and few programs can justify them. For costumers the varying amount of colour and conversions between different colour spaces cause effects like colour shifts and smearing. For the printers varying amount of colour and shifting colour spaces cause technical problems, for instance slower printing speed, <b>wrong</b> <b>colours,</b> smearing and in the end dissatisfied costumers and large extra costs. Binuscan has developed PDF Server, a program that solve some of the problems mentioned above. With PDF Server Binuscan is focusing on ink savings and conversions to the press profile. Less ink is of course an economical question, but ink saving has also other advantages; problems like smearing and mirroring decrease if less ink is used. Match press is also important for a printer that wants to reduce its costs. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate and evaluate PDF Server on Binuscan’s behalf. It was done in cooperation with a couple of printing firms. Both tests and interviews were used as methods. The tests showed {{that it is possible to}} decrease the consumption of ink and at the same time keep the colour reproduction as good as before. The interviews was also indicating that the printing quality were improved, problems like smearing, mirroring and colour cast decreased. Reproduction of press settings, the decrease of the time to press start, shorter drying times and less cleaning of press and rollers were also advantages of PDF Server. The program is however not yet perfect, some functions needs to be overhauled, the interface could be more user-friendly and complete manual needs to be developed...|$|R
60|$|Giving the stout {{shoulders}} a hug, Gyp {{seized the}} black devils, {{and ran up}} the path under the trellis, while the Scotch-terrier pups, squeezed against her breast, made confused small noises and licked her nose and ears. Through the square hall she ran into the drawing-room, which opened out on to the lawn; and there, in the French window, stood spying back at the spick-and-span room, where everything was, of course, placed just <b>wrong.</b> The <b>colouring,</b> white, ebony, and satinwood, looked nicer even than she had hoped. Out in the garden--her own garden--the pear-trees were thickening, but not in blossom yet; a few daffodils were in bloom along the walls, and a magnolia had one bud opened.

Her bedroom, the dressing-room, the spare room, the bathroom--she dashed into them all.

60|$|I lit a {{pipe and}} waited for the sun. The sky in front of me was tinged with a faint pink. Every moment it flushed a deeper red. I {{maintain}} that anyone, not an expert, would have said that was the portion of the horizon on which to keep one's eye. I kept my eye upon it, but no sun appeared. I lit another pipe. The sky in front of me was now a blaze of glory. I scribbled a few lines, likening the scattered clouds to brides blushing at the approach of the bridegroom. That would have been all right if later on they hadn't begun to turn green: it seemed the <b>wrong</b> <b>colour</b> for a bride. Later on still they went yellow, and that spoilt the simile past hope. One cannot wax poetical about a bride who at the approach of the bridegroom turns first green and then yellow: you can only feel sorry for her. I waited some more. The sky in front of me grew paler every moment. I began to fear that something had happened to that sun. If I hadn't known so much astronomy I should have said that he had changed his mind and had gone back again. I rose with the idea of seeing into things. He had been up apparently for hours: he had got up at the back of me. It seemed to be nobody's fault. I put my pipe into my pocket and strolled round to the front. The cow was still there; she was pleased to see me, and started bellowing again.|$|E
60|$|If {{you have}} been obedient, and have {{hitherto}} done all that I have told you, I trust {{it has not been}} without much subdued remonstrance, and some serious vexation. For I should be sorry if, when you were led by the course of your study to observe closely such things as are beautiful in colour, you had not longed to paint them, and felt considerable difficulty in complying with your restriction to the use of black, or blue, or grey. You ought to love colour, and to think nothing quite beautiful or perfect without it; and if you really do love it, for its own sake, and are not merely desirous to colour because you think painting a finer thing than drawing, there is some chance you may colour well. Nevertheless, you need not hope ever to produce anything more than pleasant helps to memory, or useful and suggestive sketches in colour, unless you mean to be wholly an artist. You may, in the time which other vocations leave at your disposal, produce finished, beautiful, and masterly drawings in light and shade. But to colour well, requires your life. It cannot be done cheaper. The difficulty of doing right is increased--not twofold nor threefold, but a thousandfold, and more--by the addition of colour to your work. For the chances are more than a thousand to one against your being right both in form and colour with a given touch: it is difficult enough to be right in form, if you attend to that only; but when you have to attend, at the same moment, to a much more subtle thing than the form, the difficulty is strangely increased--and multiplied almost to infinity by this great fact, that, while form is absolute, so that you can say at the moment you draw any line that it is either right or <b>wrong,</b> <b>colour</b> is wholly relative. Every hue throughout your work is altered by every touch that you add in other places; so that what was warm a minute ago, becomes cold when you have put a hotter colour in another place, and what was in harmony when you left it, becomes discordant as you set other colours beside it; so that every touch must be laid, not with a view to its effect at the time, but with a view to its effect in futurity, the result upon it of all that is afterwards to be done being previously considered. You may easily understand that, this being so, nothing but the devotion of life, and great genius besides, can make a colourist.|$|E
60|$|And then {{followed}} an experience impossible to describe. It {{was as if}} I had been blundering about since my birth with two huge and unmanageable machines, of different shapes and without apparent connection--the world and the Christian tradition. I had found this hole in the world: {{the fact that one}} must somehow find a way of loving the world without trusting it; somehow one must love the world without being worldly. I found this projecting feature of Christian theology, like a sort of hard spike, the dogmatic insistence that God was personal, and had made a world separate from Himself. The spike of dogma fitted exactly into the hole in the world--it had evidently been meant to go there-- and then the strange thing began to happen. When once these two parts of the two machines had come together, one after another, all the other parts fitted and fell in with an eerie exactitude. I could hear bolt after bolt over all the machinery falling into its place with a kind of click of relief. Having got one part right, all the other parts were repeating that rectitude, as clock after clock strikes noon. Instinct after instinct was answered by doctrine after doctrine. Or, to vary the metaphor, I was like one who had advanced into a hostile country to take one high fortress. And when that fort had fallen the whole country surrendered and turned solid behind me. The whole land was lit up, as it were, back to the first fields of my childhood. All those blind fancies of boyhood which in the fourth chapter I have tried in vain to trace on the darkness, became suddenly transparent and sane. I was right when I felt that roses were red by some sort of choice: it was the divine choice. I was right when I felt that I would almost rather say that grass was the <b>wrong</b> <b>colour</b> than say it must by necessity have been that colour: it might verily have been any other. My sense that happiness hung on the crazy thread of a condition did mean something when all was said: it meant the whole doctrine of the Fall. Even those dim and shapeless monsters of notions which I {{have not been able to}} describe, much less defend, stepped quietly into their places like colossal caryatides of the creed. The fancy that the cosmos was not vast and void, but small and cosy, had a fulfilled significance now, for anything that is a work of art must be small in the sight of the artist; to God the stars might be only small and dear, like diamonds. And my haunting instinct that somehow good was not merely a tool to be used, but a relic to be guarded, like the goods from Crusoe's ship-- even that had been the wild whisper of something originally wise, for, according to Christianity, we were indeed the survivors of a wreck, the crew of a golden ship that had gone down before the beginning of the world.|$|E
60|$|Flowers {{transmit}} their colour truly, or most capriciously. Many annuals come true: thus I purchased German {{seeds of}} thirty-four named sub-varieties of one RACE of ten-week stocks (Matthiola annua), {{and raised a}} hundred and forty plants, all of which, {{with the exception of}} a single plant, came true. In saying this, however, it must be understood that I could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the thirty-four named sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower always correspond with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that they came true, because in each of the thirty- six short rows every plant was absolutely alike, with the one single exception. Again, I procured packets of German seed of twenty-five named varieties of common and quilled asters, and raised a hundred and twenty- four plants; of these, all except ten were true in the above limited sense; and I considered even a <b>wrong</b> shade of <b>colour</b> as false.|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{logistics}} is {{a popular}} topic for retailers, {{especially when it comes}} to clothing retailers and their webshops. Reverse logistics has been given much attention in recent years due to the cost it brings for companies. There are not many studies made on reverse logistics, especially since it is regarded as a new field of research. The few studies that have been made all have different definitions, which prove the challenge it brings for companies facing the cost problem. However, companies that find a way to operate its reverse logistics activities in an efficient way can gain major competitive advantages, thus the reverse flow is much more complicated than forward logistics. The research is based on a case study of Nudie Jeans and investigates how their reverse logistics activities are structured as well as the return policy. In order to gather relevant data interviews mainly with representatives from Nudie Jeans‘s headquarter and their warehouse Korallen were carried out. Also, their competitors and the purchasing conditions were investigated in order to make a comparison to see how Nudie Jeans competed in the fierce clothing market. The main result from this study is that Nudie Jeans needs to change the price for returns, so that customers can buy products without feeling any anxiety of choosing the <b>wrong</b> size or <b>colour.</b> By doing so they can compete with other clothing retailers, who offer free returns.

Neither can I conceive with what view he should have engaged Diana in the gloomy maze of casuistry which schoolmen called philosophy, or in the equally abstruse though more certain sciences of mathematics and astronomy; unless it were to break down and confound in her mind the difference and distinction between the sexes, and to habituate her to trains of subtle reasoning, by which he might at his own time invest that which is <b>wrong</b> with the <b>colour</b> of that which is right. It was in the same spirit, though in the latter case the evil purpose was more obvious, that the lessons of Rashleigh had encouraged Miss Vernon in setting at nought and despising the forms and ceremonial limits which are drawn round females in modern society. It is true, she was sequestrated from all female company, and could not learn the usual rules of decorum, either from example or precept; yet such was her innate modesty, and accurate sense of what was right and wrong, that she would not of herself have adopted the bold uncompromising manner which struck me with so much surprise on our first acquaintance, had she not been led to conceive that a contempt of ceremony indicated at once superiority of understanding and the confidence of conscious innocence. Her wily instructor had, no doubt, his own views in levelling those outworks which reserve and caution erect around virtue. But for these, and for his other crimes, he has long since answered at a higher tribunal.|$|R

6000|$|As to {{the choice}} and harmony of colours in general, if you cannot choose and {{harmonize}} them by instinct, {{you will never}} do it at all. If you need examples of utterly harsh and horrible colour, you may find plenty given in treatises upon colouring, to illustrate the laws of harmony; {{and if you want}} to colour beautifully, colour as best pleases yourself at quiet times, not so as to catch the eye, nor to look as if it were clever or difficult to colour in that way, but so that the colour may be pleasant to you when you are happy, or thoughtful. Look much at the morning and evening sky, and much at simple flowers--dog-roses, wood hyacinths, violets, poppies, thistles, heather, and such like--as Nature arranges them in the woods and fields. If ever any scientific person tells you that two colours are [...] "discordant," [...] make a note of the two colours, and put them together whenever you can. I have actually heard people say that blue and green were discordant; the two colours which Nature seems to intend never to be separated and never to be felt, either of them, in its full beauty without the other!--a peacock's neck, or a blue sky through green leaves, or a blue wave with green lights though it, being precisely the loveliest things, next to clouds at sunrise, in this coloured world of ours. If you have a good eye for colours, you will soon find out how constantly Nature puts purple and green together, purple and scarlet, green and blue, yellow and neutral grey, and the like; and how she strikes these colour-concords for general tones, and then works into them with innumerable subordinate ones; and you will gradually come to like what she does, and find out new and beautiful chords of colour in her work every day. If you enjoy them, depend upon it you will paint them to a certain point right: or, at least, if you do not enjoy them, you are certain to paint them <b>wrong.</b> If <b>colour</b> does not give you intense pleasure, let it alone; depend upon it, you are only tormenting the eyes and senses of people who feel colour, whenever you touch it; and that is unkind and improper. You will find, also, your power of colouring depend much on your state of health and right balance of mind; when you are fatigued or ill you will not see colours well, and when you are ill-tempered you will not choose them well: thus, though not infallibly a test of character in individuals, colour power is a great sign of mental health in nations; when they are in a state of intellectual decline, their colouring always gets dull.[242] You must also take great care not to be misled by affected talk about colour from people who have not the gift of it: numbers are eager and voluble about it who probably never in all their lives received one genuine colour-sensation. The modern religionists of the school of Overbeck are just like people who eat slate-pencil and chalk, and assure everybody that they are nicer and purer than strawberries and plums.|$|R
