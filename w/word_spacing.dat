25|$|The {{earliest}} manuscripts had negligible punctuation {{and breathing}} marks. The manuscripts also lacked <b>word</b> <b>spacing,</b> so words, sentences, and paragraphs {{would be a}} continuous string of letters (scriptio continua), often with line breaks {{in the middle of}} words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way {{to reduce the number of}} pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the nomina sacra. Yet another method involved the palimpsest, a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus and the Syriac Sinaiticus).|$|E
25|$|The {{print of}} the Goražde Psalter is clean, clear, and easy to read. The text in red was printed first, {{followed}} by the text in black. The faces of the cast metal types used for its printing were designed {{in the manner of}} uncial Cyrillic of medieval Serbian manuscripts, with certain elements of cursive. Ordinary text is printed in black letters with the corpus size of 2.7millimetres. Their strokes have moderately varying widths; their ascenders and descenders are also of moderate sizes. In the first 136 leaves, a block of ten lines of text written in these letters is 74millimetres high, and there are usually 18 to 20, though occasionally 21, lines per page. In the other leaves, the ten-line block is 70millimetres high, with mostly 22 lines per page, and <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> is tighter than {{in the first part of}} the book. Somewhat larger letters, 5 to 6millimetres high, appear at the beginning of some sentences; they can be black or red. Headings and lines at the beginning of textual units are printed in red. Among the punctuation marks used in the book are the indexes and symbols in the form of a fish, horn, and quadruple dot.|$|E
25|$|The en dash – {{always with}} spaces in running text when, as {{discussed}} in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the not spaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated {{by the use of}} thin spaces, hair spaces, or even zero-width spaces {{on the sides of the}} em dash. This provides the appearance of a not spaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Word</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{preceding}} or following punctuation, {{should be}} optically adjusted {{to appear to}} be of the same value as a standard <b>word</b> <b>space.</b> If a standard <b>word</b> <b>space</b> is inserted after a full point or a comma, then, optically, this produces a space of up to 50% wider than that of other <b>word</b> <b>spaces</b> within a line of type. This is because these punctuation marks carry space above them, which, when added to the adjacent standard <b>word</b> <b>spaces,</b> combines to create a visually larger space. Some argue that the [...] "additional" [...] space after a comma and full point serves as a [...] "pause signal" [...] for the reader. But this is unnecessary (and visually disruptive) since the pause signal is provided by the punctuation mark itself.|$|R

500|$|Until the 20th century, {{publishing}} {{houses and}} printers {{in many countries}} used additional space between sentences. [...] There were exceptions to this traditional spacing method—some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than <b>word</b> <b>spacing.</b> [...] This was French spacing—a term synonymous with single-space sentence spacing until the late 20th century. [...] With {{the introduction of the}} typewriter in the late 19thcentury, typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters. [...] While wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid-20th century, the practice continued on typewriters and later on computers. [...] Perhaps because of this, many modern sources now incorrectly claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{hierarchical}} model incorporating motion patterns, proto symbols and words is proposed. The proto symbols abstract motion patterns, while {{the words are}} associated with the proto symbols stochastically. This paper describes the construction of a <b>word</b> <b>space,</b> where <b>words</b> are located in a multidimensional space based on dissimilarities among the words. The dissimilarity between two words can be calculated by using association probabilities that the words generate motion proto symbols. The <b>word</b> <b>space</b> encapsulates relations among the words such as similar or dissimilar pairs of <b>words.</b> The <b>word</b> <b>space</b> also allows motion recognition based on words. The validity of the constructed <b>word</b> <b>space</b> is demonstrated on a motion capture database. Moreover, the addition of the word associations is found to change the conventional proto symbol space so that the discrimination among the proto symbols is improved. I...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Word</b> <b>spacing</b> in {{typography}} {{refers to}} the size of the space between words. It should be distinguished from letter-spacing (the spacing between the letters within each word) and sentence spacing (the spacing between sentences). Typographers may modify the spacing of letters or words in a body of type to aid readability and copy fit, or for aesthetic effect. In web browsers and standardized digital typography the <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> is controlled by the CSS1 word-spacing property.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Word</b> <b>spacing</b> {{is crucial}} for the written form because it {{illustrates}} the sound of speech where audible gaps or pauses take place [...] With typography, <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> shows this unspoken aspect of speech. Otherwise, {{it would be difficult}} for people to read one long continuous line of letters. It is hard to determine how much spacing should be put in between words, but a good typographer is able to determine proper spacing. When text and spacing are consistent, this makes it easier to read.|$|E

40|$|<b>Word</b> <b>space</b> models, in {{the sense}} of vector space models built on {{distributional}} data taken from texts, are used to model semantic relations between words. We argue that the high dimensionality of typical vector space models lead to unintuitive effects on modeling likeness of meaning and that the local structure of <b>word</b> <b>spaces</b> is where interesting semantic relations reside. We show that the local structure of <b>word</b> <b>spaces</b> has substantially different dimensionality and character than the global space and that this structure shows potential to be exploited for further semantic analysis using methods for local analysis of vector space structure rather than globally scoped methods typically in use today such as singular value decomposition or principal component analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{will analyze}} the {{behavior}} of several parameters, namely type of contexts, similarity measures, and <b>word</b> <b>space</b> models, in the task of word similarity extraction from large corpora.

Special attention will {{be paid to the}} comparison between syntax-based contexts and windowing techniques, binary similarity metrics and more elaborate coefficients, as well as baseline <b>word</b> <b>space</b> models and Singular Value Decomposition strategies. The evaluation leads us to conclude that the combination of syntax-based contexts, binary similarity metrics, and a baseline <b>word</b> <b>space</b> model makes the extraction much more precise than other combinations with more elaborate metrics and complex models. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} pointed out the differ-ence between the {{concepts}} of semantic similarity and semantic relatedness.
