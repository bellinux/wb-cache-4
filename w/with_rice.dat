40|$|Abstract. The {{upper part}} and {{lower part of}} rice straw were {{respectively}} used as raw materials to prepare composites with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) by hot-pressing at 140 ℃ for 10 min. The performance differences of two kinds of composites were studied. Results showed that composites prepared <b>with</b> upper-part <b>rice</b> straw had higher tensile strength, strength at tensile break and hardness than that <b>with</b> lower-part <b>rice</b> straw. But the tensile elongation of composite prepared <b>with</b> upper-part <b>rice</b> straw was lower than that <b>with</b> upper-part <b>rice</b> straw. Difference ratio of tensile strength is higher than 6 % and difference ratio of tensile elongation is higher than 16 %. These differences were related to morphology and structure of upper-part rice straw and lower-part rice straw. Two parts of rice straw are both hollow, but upper-part rice straw has thinner holes. So the defect ratio of composite prepared <b>with</b> upper-part <b>rice</b> straw was low...|$|R

5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited <b>with</b> <b>Rice,</b> {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Mangalorean Catholic diet was {{completely}} vegetarian. This changed during the 20th century, when {{with the advent}} of Westernisation, meat came to be consumed increasingly in the community, especially amongst the elite.

Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna is idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas is pork) {{is one of the most}} popular dishes of the Mangalorean Catholic community.

5|$|If {{the account}} of Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the {{unearthing}} of Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map. The Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD. Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains <b>with</b> <b>Rice</b> (c. 845 AD). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant 0.93 m2 (10ft2) jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421–466 AD) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479).|$|E
