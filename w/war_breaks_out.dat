Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across Aiur, while the cerebrates—the secondary commanders of the Swarm—attempt to regain control. After the discovery of alien life in the Koprulu Sector, the United Earth Directorate (UED)—the international body governing Earth—decides to send an expeditionary force to secure the sector and prevent the aliens from finding Earth.

25|$|The Shadows, {{an ancient}} and {{extremely}} powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are {{revealed to be}} the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258. Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with their mysterious human representative Mr. Morden in the ongoing conflict with the Narn. The elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, unfortunately has insufficient control to prevent others from instigating war against the Narn Regime. When the emperor dies suddenly during a peace mission to Babylon 5, a number of conspirators, including Ambassador Londo Mollari and Lord Refa, take control of the Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor's unstable nephew on the throne. Their first act is to start open aggression against the Narn. After a full-scale <b>war</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>out,</b> the Centauri {{with the help of the}} Shadows through Londo eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving mass drivers, outlawed weapons of mass destruction. Towards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting freedom of speech. The Vorlons are revealed to be the basis of legends about angels on various worlds, including Earth, and are the ancient enemies of the Shadows. They enlist the aid of Sheridan and the Babylon 5 command staff in the struggle against the Shadows.|$|E
500|$|When Ike {{returns to}} his headquarters, he is hired by the Laguz Alliance, {{consisting}} of the hawk nation of Phoenicis, the raven nation of Kilvas, and the beast nation of Gallia. Their representative, Ranulf, explains that Rafiel has revealed that the Begnion senate was responsible for assassinating the previous apostle of Begnion and framing the heron clans for it, resulting in their near annihilation. This {{has led to the}} newly formed Laguz Alliance declaring war on Begnion. The situation quickly escalates, threatening to become a world war that will awaken the god of chaos Yune, who will supposedly destroy the world if unleashed. Begnion coerces Daein into preparing to join the war on their side with the blood pact and uses another blood pact to force Kilvas to betray the Laguz Alliance. The Alliance makes major gains in the early months of the conflict, aided a great deal by the tactical ingenuity of Ike and his mercenaries. As the Alliance prepares to march south into Begnion's heartland, the Begnion central army arrives to block the way. The central army is better equipped than the previous enemies of the Alliance and is led by the highly capable General Zelgius. Zelgius and his army hold back an attempted river crossing by the Alliance, and Zelgius defeats Skirmir (the hot-headed commander of the beast laguz) in single combat, severely wounding him. While this is occurring, Begnion launches an invasion of Phoenicis and razes its capital to the ground, severely weakening the capabilities of the hawk laguz. Seeing the weakened state of the Alliance, the Begnion senate orders Daein to enter the war and crush the Laguz Alliance. Seeing no other choice, Pelleas orders Micaiah (who, along with the population of Daein, know nothing of the blood pact) to lead the Daein army south into Begnion. Micaiah attempts to trap the Alliance between her forces and the central army, but a lack of concern for her soldiers {{on the part of the}} Begnion senate deprives her of accurate information on the size of the laguz forces. Ike is able to lead the Alliance to safety. Zelgius, openly loyal to Empress Sanaki in the decades long political Senate-Empress power struggle, allows the Alliance to escape, hinting to Ike that the Empress does not support the war. In response to this, the senators have Sanaki's prime minister and father figure Sephiran arrested. The Empress flees the capital of Begnion soon afterward with her royal guard. Now in control of the country, the senate orders Zelgius (who is an ardent supporter of Sephiran) to pursue and destroy the retreating Laguz Alliance, and sends one of their number, Senator Valtome, to enforce order in the army. The Alliance falls back to the borders of Gallia, the homeland of the beast nation. Ike is able to lead the Alliance through a perilous volcanic cave network and thereby elude the central army. Undeterred, the senate decides to invade Gallia by marching through the neutral nation of Crimea. Begnion demands that Elincia provide them with supplies, but the Queen refuses due to her alliance with Gallia (signed at the end of Path of Radiance) and because the earlier rebellion destroyed much of the kingdom's crops. Valtome, infuriated by the denial, orders the central army to take what it needs from the Crimeans, whom he views as subjects of Begnion. Begnion begins raiding Crimean villages for supplies, drawing the Crimean Royal Knights into a skirmish. As the Laguz Alliance and the central army prepare to fight a battle on Crimean soil, Elincia arrives and places herself in between the two opposing armies. She demands that both sides leave Crimean territory, as it is a land of peace. Zelgius leads the central army off of the field of battle, an action that enrages Valtome. He orders his soldiers to kill Elincia, an action prevented by the Royal Knights and Greil Mercenaries. Back in the central army camp, Valtome orders Zelgius to be executed for his disloyalty. This is stopped by the arrival of Empress Sanaki and her royal guard. The soldiers of the central army turn on Valtome, who flees with all of the men loyal to the senate. Soon after, the Crimeans, the Empress' men, and the Laguz Alliance members sign a treaty and make a pact to defeat the Begnion senate. Civil <b>war</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>out</b> across the Begnion Empire as the forces of the Empress and Senate begin to clash.|$|E
