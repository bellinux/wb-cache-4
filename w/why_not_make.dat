2500|$|In December 1909, The Washington Post {{published}} Cochems {{comments on}} the game under the headline, [...] "FOOTBALL LIKE AN AIRSHIP WOULD OPEN UP THE GAME." [...] Cochems advocated the redesign of the football to render it more aerodynamic and easy to handle:"The story in a nutshell is this. [...] The ball is too large and too light. Some of the best teams in the country find it impossible to use the pass owing to lack of players who can make it. ... Since {{it is impossible to}} grow larger hands and it is possible to make the ball conform to human dimensions, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> the ball fit the needed conditions? ... With a ball such as I have proposed, longer, narrower, and a bit heavier, so that it would carry {{in the face of a}} strong wind, I firmly believe that the game of rugby would develop [...] into one of the most beautiful and versatile sports the world ever saw." ...|$|E

60|$|MARTELLUS. <b>Why</b> did you <b>not</b> <b>make</b> {{a man and}} a woman? Their {{children}} would have been interesting.|$|R
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. <b>Why</b> did you <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a woman {{instead of}} a man? She would have known how to behave herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are {{satisfied}} that Mr. Fitch is all right, Dad, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> have him <b>make</b> {{a survey of}} the Franklin place?" [...] suggested Jack.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are, {{but since}} it may be some time before {{you are in a}} {{condition}} to leave here, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> yourself familiar with this branch of mining?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strategy, my dear Brill," [...] he said, smiling; [...] "strategy. Now why {{waste your}} time? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> some other woman happy? Why not try her companion, Miss Philpotts? I’m sure any little assistance—" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a sorry {{business}} at the best, Whiskey; and now you're fairly sober, if you'll take my advice you'll remain so. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> up your mind, like a man, and vow you'll never touch another drop." ...|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN [coaxingly] <b>Why</b> do you <b>not</b> <b>make</b> toys of us? Then {{you would}} play with us; {{and that would}} be very nice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't care. I mean to {{kill the}} man afterwards; but that is no reason <b>why</b> I should <b>not</b> <b>make</b> myself {{pleasant}} to his spouse.' ...|$|R
60|$|STREPHON [crying out in {{his grief}} for the first time] <b>Why</b> did you <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a woman whom you could love? That was the secret you needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} traitor, Your Majesty," [...] protested Files. [...] "I {{resigned}} in a proper manner, not liking the job. But {{there are plenty of}} people to take my place. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> Shaggy Man the private soldier?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} hand, and as I did so a politic idea flashed up within me. If I must {{be friends with}} this woman, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> use of her? This was a moment when she was well {{disposed}} to serve me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seeing my opportunity, I came to {{the rescue}} this time. 'You have got a yacht, Mr. Armadale,' I said; 'and you know that Midwinter is going to Italy. When you are tired of Somersetshire, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a voyage to the Mediterranean, and meet your friend, and your friend's wife, at Naples?' ...|$|E
40|$|Political {{parties in}} Italy are in crisis. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> really <b>make</b> parties "the tools by which {{citizens}} contribute to national politics"? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> encourage parties (and governments) {{to listen to}} the people-for issues, for candidates and for how to change the system itself? Would it not be easier for parties to regain the trust of voters if they used public funding also to involve citizens in their decisions...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{yet he is}} so good-humoured, and so gay, and so pleasant, that I do <b>not</b> see <b>why</b> {{he should}} <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a very good husband to some girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is that, and <b>why</b> did you <b>not</b> <b>make</b> {{use of it}} {{just now}} to prevent our being needlessly led farther into these mountains?" [...] asked Fred, in surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make your room-door fast to-night, and {{tomorrow}} let Bob have a bed there," [...] he said earnestly, as {{he rose to}} go. [...] "By the way, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> those chalk marks on the door just for the night? You can laugh at them to-morrow. Sort of suggestion of the Passover about it, isn’t there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By all means, give it away," [...] I said. [...] "Give it {{for some}} public purpose. That will at least be better than any private purpose, and put it somehow in {{the control of the}} State, beyond the reach of {{individuals}} or corporations. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it the foundation of a free school {{for the study of the}} Altrurian polity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I just {{stuck on}} {{and did what}} I could with the stuff. I got a bit of money of my own--and I said to myself, 'Well, here you are with the gear and no one to look after you. You won't get such a chance again, my boy, not in all your born days. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> what you can with it? '" ...|$|E
60|$|Seth {{was more}} alarmed {{now than when}} he saw the flames of the burning oil {{threatening}} the destruction of the building, and he dumbly wondered <b>why</b> Gladys did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> her appearance.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{whites are}} among the savages, <b>why</b> should they <b>not</b> <b>make</b> {{themselves}} known?" [...] demanded Robert Willoughby. [...] "Your character, sir, is no secret; {{and they must be}} acquainted with their own errand here." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{old lady}} leant {{back in her}} chair, placed her hands on its arms and softly panted, while out of the rather broad {{serenity}} of her face she sat blinking up at her companion as if after a long talk, instead of {{at the beginning of}} one. 'No,' she repeated reflectively, 'I don't like your looks at all; yet here we are, enjoying beautiful autumn weather, Mr Lawford, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> use of it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{your fault}} if I say this," [...] she whispered. [...] "It is you {{yourself}} who have prepared the way. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> sure of riches? The world can give {{so much to}} the rich. You can buy education, manners, taste. Anything, surely, would be better than taking up the life of an auctioneer's clerk once more? With riches you can at least get away from the most oppressive forms of vulgarity." ...|$|E
6000|$|His dam {{held that}} the Quiet made all things [...] 170 Which Setebos vexed only: 'holds not so. Who made them weak, meant {{weakness}} He might vex. Had He meant other, while His hand was in, <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> horny eyes no thorn could prick, Or plate my scalp with bone against the snow, Or overscale my flesh 'neath joint and joint, Like an orc's armour? Ay,--so spoil His sport! He is the One now: only He doth all.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you join}} me you will run a good many," [...] said Maxwell. [...] "There were reasons <b>why</b> I could <b>not</b> <b>make</b> the offer until to-day. Give me {{about ten minutes}} to explain the venture." ...|$|R
5000|$|Will Payne {{made the}} {{conscious}} choice not to pattern his performance after previous Charley Brewsters William Ragsdale or Anton Yelchin. [...] "This {{is a whole}} new cast so <b>why</b> <b>not</b> try and <b>make</b> this my own character, my own creation?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{like him}} {{simply because he}} does not talk much. That may be a good reason <b>why</b> you should <b>not</b> <b>make</b> of him an {{intimate}} companion,--because you like talkative people; but it should be no ground for dislike." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} {{anything}} of Mrs. Charmond's past history? Perhaps that would throw some light upon things. Before she came here as the wife of old Charmond {{four or five years}} ago, not a soul seems to have heard aught of her. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> inquiries? And then do ye wait and see more; there'll be plenty of opportunity. Time enough to cry when you know 'tis a crying matter; and 'tis bad to meet troubles half-way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why," [...] rejoined Cineas, [...] "can not we {{sit down}} and take our ease, and enjoy {{ourselves}} now, instead of taking all this trouble beforehand? You have already at your command every possible means of enjoyment; <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> yourself happy with them now, instead of entering on a course which will lead to such dreadful toils and dangers, such innumerable calamities, and through such seas of blood, and yet bring you after all, at the end, nothing more than you have at the beginning?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You say," [...] she continued, [...] "that in {{your own}} country the limits of life are being drawn closer. <b>Why</b> do you <b>not</b> <b>make</b> for {{yourself}} a career {{in a country like}} this? Theos has need of such men as you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That is {{a capital}} plan, Master Stephen,” Wilcox said. “I {{have not been}} {{thinking}} of a village, except {{as to how to}} get past it; but, as you say, there is no reason <b>why</b> we should <b>not</b> <b>make</b> off in a canoe.” ...|$|R
6000|$|When on the {{way home}} Mistress Susan asked her little boy <b>why</b> he would <b>not</b> <b>make</b> his obeisance to the pretty lady, he sturdily answered, [...] "She is no pretty lady of mine. She is an evil woman who slew her husband." ...|$|R
