5000|$|In 1918 he left Edison's lab {{to devote}} {{full-time}} {{to his own}} company: Miller Reese Hutchison, Incorporated had been formed in 1916 to further develop and sell batteries developed at Edison's laboratory. After World War I he founded Hutchison Office Specialties Company for the new market of electric business machines. One popular product was the [...] "Spool-O-Wire" [...] fastener machine. As its name implied, it used a continuous spool of wire to attach business documents to each other. It was advertised as handling from two to 40 sheets of paper, cloth, or cardboard, with a single <b>wire</b> <b>spool</b> replacing 15,000 individual staples.|$|E

Lara {{can use the}} environment to her advantage; hiding in bushes or trees, shooting arrows at objects to distract enemies, crafting Molotov cocktails and makeshift grenades, or avoiding combat altogether by climbing trees and traversing rooftops. The bow and arrow return from Tomb Raider. The grappling hook, now known as a <b>wire</b> <b>spool,</b> also returns after being absent from the series since Tomb Raider: Underworld. Different types of bows can be fashioned from specific animals and materials that Lara can hunt and salvage. Lara's pistol, shotgun, assault rifle and climbing axe all return from Tomb Raider, each with their own variants. New items introduced include a hunting knife for melee or sneak attacks, a re-breather for underwater exploration, and a lock pick to open locked crates and doors.|$|E
50|$|The last {{entry in}} the class is the UGST heavy {{deepwater}} torpedo {{with a range of}} up to 60 km (export versions are limited to 40 km). It differs from the most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or peroxide propulsion, it uses the Otto fuel axial engine, which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots. It also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive wake homing, features a phased array active sonar and an improved wire guidance system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance <b>wire</b> <b>spool</b> in the torpedo body, with the wire released through the hollow propeller shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the wire release port on the side. Together with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before. It was supposed to enter service in the 1990s, but the teething problems and the lack of funding during that period made the deployment sluggish, and it entered the widespread service only in the 2015 by the Fizik name, being quickly replaced by the new-generation Futlyar (Fizik-2). Sources refer to them as heat-seeking torpedoes.|$|E
40|$|Tritium up {{to fifty}} times {{background}} {{has been observed}} upon electrolyzing 1 N D 2 SO 4 in four out of four cells when using Pd cathodes "of a certain type". No tritium was detected in four control cells, containing H 2 S 04 in H 2 O, employing Pd cathodes cut from the same <b>wire</b> <b>spool.</b> Tritium amounts were from 7 x 1010 to 2. 1 × 1011 atoms, corresponding to average generation rates from 5. 1 × 104 to 2 × 105 atoms/sec/cm 2. In all cases, D/Pd and H/Pd loadings of 1 ± 0. 05 were attained. A cyclic loading/unloading regime rather than the usual continuous constant current regime was applied to attain these high loadings. Tritium analysis was performed in Pd, electrolyte and the gas head space of the sealed cells. Maximum tritium concentrations of 8. 9 × 1010 atoms/g Pd, 180 times the detection limit, {{were found in the}} D-loaded Pd cathodes, none in the Η-loaded Pd, Also, no tritium within detection limit was found in 150 unused Pd pieces. Of these, 13 were cut randomly from the same <b>wire</b> <b>spool</b> as the four D-loaded Pd cathodes. The probability that the tritium in the latter was due to random spot contamination is computed as 1 in 2, 380. It is concluded that the tritium was generated by nuclear reactions in the Pd. However, no tritium was detected in four D-loaded Pd cathodes of a different type in spite of attaining loadings D/Pd = 1. Different metallurgical history and impurity contents may play an important role. I...|$|E

40|$|At Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, {{the author}} {{designed}} and fabricated a precision wire feeder {{to be used}} with high energy density (electron beam and laser beam) welding for weld joints where filler wire might be needed to fill a gap or to adjust the chemical composition so that a crack-free weld could be made. The wire feeder incorporates a 25, 000 step-per-revolution motor to power a urethane-coated drive roll. A microprocessor-based controller provides precise control of the motor and allows both continuous and pulsed feeding of the wire. A unidirectional 0. 75 -in. -dia ball bearing is used to press the wire against the drive roll. A slight constant backward tension is maintained on the <b>wire</b> <b>spool</b> by a Bodine torque motor. A Teflon tube is used to guide the wire from the drive roll to the vicinity of the weld, where a hypodermic needle is used to aim the wire into the weld pool. The operation of the wire feeder was demonstrated by feeding a 10 -mil-dia, Type 304 stainless steel wire into a variety of CO{sub 2 } laser beam welds. The resulting welds are smooth and continuous, and the welds are considered to be completely satisfactory for a variety of applications...|$|E
50|$|Ionized {{material}} {{captured by}} the magnetic field lines will rotate with the Sun {{as if it were}} a solid body. As material escapes from the Sun due to the solar wind, the highly ionized material will be {{captured by the}} field lines and rotate with the same angular velocity as the Sun, even though it is carried far away from the Sun's surface, until it eventually escapes. This effect of carrying mass far from the centre of the Sun and throwing it away slows down the spin of the Sun. The same effect is used in slowing the spin of a rotating satellite; here two <b>wires</b> <b>spool</b> out weights to a distance slowing the satellites spin, then the wires are cut, letting the weights escape into space and permanently robbing the spacecraft of its angular momentum.|$|R
5000|$|The missile has a {{distinctive}} bulging nose and four clipped triangular wings. The missile has two {{solid fuel rocket}} motors. One is a powerful booster rocket that burns for 2.2 seconds and the second, is a sustainer motor that burns for 28 seconds. The booster motor exhausts through two nozzles on the sides near {{the trailing edge of}} the wings [...] and the sustainer motor exhaust is located in the missile rear at the center. The wings are positioned at an angle of one degree to the direction of flight so that the missile spins, giving it stability. Two rearward-facing flares which ignite on launch make the missile more visible to the operator during flight. Two flares are mounted {{on the opposite side of}} the booster nozzles between the wings so as not to interfere with the two guidance <b>wires</b> <b>spooling</b> out of the rear section of the missile.|$|R

A thin-walled cylinder is positioned coaxially between the rotor and the stator to prevent debris from the stator windings from reaching the rotor. The stator windings are wound on <b>wire</b> <b>spools</b> made of ceramic, thereby avoiding need for mica insulation and epoxy/adhesive. The stator and rotor are encased in a stator housing with rear and front end caps, and rear and front bearings for the rotor shaft are mounted on external sides of the end caps to keep debris from the motor migrating into the bearings' races...|$|R

50|$|Forge welding {{has been}} used {{throughout}} its history for making most any items out of steel and iron. It {{has been used}} in everything from the manufacture of tools, farming implements, and cookware to the manufacture of fences, gates, and prison cells. In the early Industrial Revolution, it was commonly used in the manufacture of boilers and pressure vessels, until the introduction of fusion-welding. It was commonly used through the Middle Ages for producing armor and weapons. One of the most famous applications of forge welding involves the production of pattern-welded blades. During this process a smith repeatedly draws out a billet of steel, folds it back and welds it upon itself. Another application was the manufacture of shotgun barrels. Metal <b>wire</b> was <b>spooled</b> onto a mandrel, and then forged into a barrel that was thin, uniform, and strong. In some cases the forge-welded objects are acid-etched to expose the underlying pattern of metal, which is unique to each item and provides aesthetic appeal.|$|R
50|$|Wire-cut {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) is primarily used for small production lot sizes where either extreme precision is required or other cutting technologies are not readily available. Wire-cut EDM cuts keyways by eroding material away from the workpiece {{through a series of}} rapid electric current discharges between a <b>spooling</b> <b>wire</b> and the workpiece through a dielectric liquid. Computer numerical control (CNC) wire-cut EDM machines allow for a wide variety selection of keyways to be cut, inclusive of multiple keyways on the same hub. The main limitations of CNC wire-cut EDM is {{the time it takes to}} cut a keyway as well as the size of parts a given wire-cut EDM machine can accommodate.|$|R
50|$|In this process, a wire (or {{bundle of}} wires) is {{preheated}} to above the glass transition or melting {{temperature of the}} polymer coating {{that is to be}} applied. This is to ensure adhesion of the new coating. Next, this preheated bare wire is pulled very rapidly through a die which places a thin coating of polymer around the wire. Due to the geometry of the dies used, relatively high extrusion rates are possible while still avoiding melt fracture. The newly coated wire is then drawn through an air or gas flame to smooth the surface of the coating, and finally a water bath to fully cool the coated wire. Coated <b>wires</b> are now <b>spooled</b> to prepare for further processing, if desired.|$|R
50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of wire rope, comprising multiple <b>wire</b> strands, <b>spooling</b> the <b>wire</b> has presented technical challenges. When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers {{have a tendency to}} crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The rubbing of rope against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.These problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1937, patented the use of a groove bar on hoisting drums to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply welded or screwed to existing plain steel drums. Ever since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the <b>spooling</b> of <b>wire</b> rope onto and off winch drums.Introducing a continuous helical groove onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.Frank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.|$|R
5000|$|The medium, {{long and}} {{extended}} range {{versions of the}} Spike also have the capability of [...] "Fire, Observe and Update" [...] operating mode. The missile is connected by a fiber-optical <b>wire</b> that is <b>spooled</b> out between the launch position and the missile. With this, the operator can obtain a target {{if it is not}} in the line of sight of the operator at launch, switch targets in flight, or compensate for the movement of the target if the missile is not tracking the target for some reason. Hence, the missile can be fired speculatively for a target of opportunity, or to provide observation {{on the other side of}} an obstacle. The missile has a soft launch capability - the motor firing after the missile has left the launcher - that allows for the missile to be fired from confined spaces, which is a necessity in urban warfare.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the missile}} was about 30-50 {{meters from the}} gunner, the missile was {{propelled}} forward and guided towards the target by 3 rows of thrusters aligned longitudinally along the missile body. The rocket spiraled as it moved forward, and the thrusters were fired in pairs to move the missile forward as well as keep the missile on target. These were activated by the sight controller which sent signals from the sight mechanism to the missile along the <b>wire</b> which <b>spooled</b> out behind the missile and remained connected to the sight. The operator kept the sight crosshairs on the target; the sight tracked the infrared flare and sent corrections to the missile service motor to bring the flight of the missile to the aim point. The service charges were fired as needed both to keep the missile correcting toward the aim point and to keep it up and moving forward. A missile moving towards a stationary target and tracked by a steady gunner would fire the thrusters about every [...]5 to 1 second, resulting in its signature 'popping' sound as it moved downrange. If the operator over-corrected his aim point beyond the service motor's capability to keep up, the missile grounded itself. Conversely, if the guidance wire broke, the missile would fire its rockets rapidly, sending the missile into a rapid ascent. This was a recoilless weapon—the launcher did not [...] "kick" [...] per se when fired—but the sudden loss of the 30 lb missile weight from the shoulder caused many soldiers to flinch badly enough to lose track of the target, resulting in a missile grounding.|$|R
40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the impact of}} a Blowout Preventer (BOP) failure, this work proposes a method and machine that can create a gradual flow reduction to zero in an offshore well by introducing a mechanical plug inside the BOP. The backup safety tool, referred to as the Hampering Active Wellbore Kit (HAWK), is a machine that gradually introduces a continuous medium (e. g. <b>wire)</b> from a <b>spool</b> through the choke/kill lines of a failed BOP to gradually stem the flow through the BOP. The machine can couple to a standard choke/kill line on the BOP and can co-exist with the BOP or be deployed at the time of an accident. This work presents the design theory for wire feeding in order to form an entanglement, and the mechanism by which to accomplish the reliable feeding of the continuous structure. The efficacy of the entanglement is evaluated by comparing flow rates of a single experimental wellbore before and after the introduction of the mechanical plug. by Folkers Eduardo Rojas. Thesis: Ph.

2500|$|One {{particularly}} dangerous warhead was Livermore's W47, {{designed for}} the Polaris submarine missile. The last test before the 1958 moratorium was a one-point test of the W47 primary, which had an unacceptably high nuclear yield of [...] of TNT equivalent (Hardtack II Titania). With the test moratorium in force, {{there was no way}} to refine the design and make it inherently one-point safe. Los Alamos had a suitable primary that was one-point safe, but rather than share with Los Alamos the credit for designing the first SLBM warhead, Livermore chose to use mechanical safing on its own inherently unsafe primary. The result was a safety scheme consisting of a boron-coated wire inserted into the hollow pit at manufacture. The warhead was armed by withdrawing the <b>wire</b> onto a <b>spool</b> driven by an electric motor. Once withdrawn, the wire could not be re-inserted. [...] The wire had a tendency to become brittle during storage, and break or get stuck during arming, preventing complete removal and rendering the warhead a dud. It was estimated that 50-75% of warheads would fail. This required a complete rebuild of the W47 primaries. The oil used for lubricating the wire also promoted corrosion of the pit.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{outstanding}} current problems in both geobiology and environmental microbiology is the quantitative analysis of in situ microbial metabolic activities. Techniques capable of such analysis would have wide application, from quantifying natural rates of biogeochemical cycling to identifying the metabolic activity of uncultured organisms. We describe here a method that represents one step towards that goal, namely the high-precision measurement of ^(13) C in specific populations of microbial cells that are purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Sorted cells are concentrated on a Teflon membrane filter, and their ^(13) C content is measured by coupling an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) with a home-built <b>spooling</b> <b>wire</b> microcombustion (SWiM) apparatus. The combined instrumentation provides measurements of δ^(13) C in whole cells with precision better than 0. 2 ‰ for samples containing as little as 25 ng of carbon. When losses associated with sample handling are taken into account, isotopic analyses require sorting roughly 10 ^ 4 eukaryotic or 10 ^ 7 bacterial cells per sample. Coupled with ^(13) C-labelled substrate additions, this approach {{has the potential to}} directly quantify uptake of metabolites in specific populations of sorted cells. The high precision afforded by SWiM-IRMS also permits useful studies of natural abundance variations in ^(13) C. The approach is equally applicable to specific populations of cells sorted from multicellular organisms...|$|R

Duncan became {{interested}} in guitars at a young age, and after lending his guitar to a friend who accidentally broke the pickup, Duncan decided to re-wind it, using a record player turntable to hold the pickup in place and rotate it while <b>spooling</b> <b>wire</b> around the pickup bobbin. He was then inspired by how {{the tone of the}} guitar had changed for the better, and started learning more about pickups from guitarist/inventor Les Paul, and later mentor and humbucker inventor Seth Lover. After having developed considerable skill working on guitars, Duncan gained employment at the Fender Soundhouse in London, where he started working on the instruments and pickups of artists including Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page. After having moved to California he met and married Cathy Carter and decided to start a pickup rewinding service. With demand for his services growing, Duncan and Carter eventually expanded into offering their own Stratocaster, Telecaster and humbucking pickups, and within two decades had a full assortment of pickups for electric, bass and acoustic guitar as well as electric guitar accessories. In 2012 Seymour Duncan was inducted into the Vintage Guitar Hall of Fame for contributions to the music industry, and he continues to create pickups in the Seymour Duncan factory in Santa Barbara, California.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a pinned composite material which possesses spatially varying through-thickness thermal conductivity. When a constant temperature distribution is applied to one surface, a range of temperatures can be obtained on the opposing surface. One perceived market for this material is the pharmaceutical drug development process where it is desirable to run many in vitro tests at varying temperatures simultaneously. This led to a multi-pronged iterative design process which consisted of numerical simulation, specimen fabrication, and experimental prototype testing. Numerical simulation identified three pin arrangements of interest: clusters, a 1 D linear gradient, and a 2 D linear gradient of pins. Further simulation focused on a 1 D gradient of pins and specific candidate base and pin materials. Two different manufacturing processes which utilized a special-purpose 3 -axis CNC machine were evaluated. The first batch process inserts pin nails using a commercial pin nailer whereas the second continuous process inserts <b>spooled</b> <b>wire.</b> In experimental tests, prototypes were fabricated using the batch process. For example, a 4 °C change in temperature across the length of the test specimen was achievable. However, agreement between experimental and numerical results was imperfect. The thermal response of the prototypes was generally consistent with expectations except that the top surface was 10 - 15 °C cooler than expected. Follow-up analysis suggested this was due to several effects including probe quenching (approximately 4 °C) and manufacturing process variation (up to 8 °C) amongst other effects. The thesis concludes by identifying a number of desirable modifications in experimental protocol that will address these issue...|$|R
50|$|To {{assemble}} the ZMC-2 a skin-riveting machine {{was developed by}} the Aviation Tool Co., a division of the Detroit Aircraft Corporation. The device was invented by Edward J. Hill, who had come to work on the ZMC-2 after leaving the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The machine consisted of an aluminum casting, weighing about 100 pounds, and was supported on springs from a framework that ran on concentric circular rails set into the floor of the hangar. There were two sets of circular rails, one {{at each end of the}} building. Three riveting machines were made, one for each set of tracks, and one for reserve when repairs might be needed. The reason for two sets of tracks was that the hull was built in two sections, front and rear. Each end started from a circular plate suspended from the hangar roof by a cable and free to rotate as each 18 inch wide strip Alclad was added. In this manner, each end of the ship slowly grew as succeeding rows were added, looking like a bulls eye at first and later like a huge inverted teacup. Both sections were under construction continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week, once the hull was started. The riveting machine fed three small aluminum <b>wires</b> from large <b>spools</b> to make a seam about a quarter inch wide composed of three rivets, one above the other in a staggered pattern. In theory the machine could sew about 50 feet of seam in an hour, but in practice about 10 or more feet was the average. The sheets of Alclad used were eight to nine thousandths of an inch thick. As the each section of the hull grew internal annular rings were added at appropriate distances to give stiffness and reinforcement to the hull skin. In addition, lightweight longitudinal channels were added between the circular rings, giving the internal structure the appearance of a huge bird cage. The helium gas was contained by the hull only, no fabric was used to contain the helium. Inside the hull were two large airbag cells, called ballonets, made of rubberized fabric and containing air. These cells could be expanded or contracted to control pressure as the helium expanded or contracted with the heating or cooling of the atmosphere or to adapt to changes of atmospheric pressure with altitude, and to control fore and aft trim. In operation the ZMC-2 was susceptible to heating and cooling effects of the sun causing it to pop and buckle in the evenings if pressure from blowers was not applied. During its service life the ZMC-2 was found to have a gas diffusion rate much lower than that of fabric-hulled blimps, meaning that a much longer time would pass before additional helium needed to be added.|$|R
