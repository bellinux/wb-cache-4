There have been times when I've really thought of writing to you; I've even had a bold bad idea of proposing myself to you for a Sunday. Then the crisis, my momentary alarm, has struck me as blowing over, and I've felt I could wait for some luck like this, which would sooner or later come."

However, you English, I know, don't like one to speak of one's religion. I'm just as simply thankful for mine--I mean with as little sense of indecency or agony about it--as I am for my health or my carriage. My point is at any rate that I say in no cruel spirit of triumph, yet do none the less very distinctly say, that the person Mr. Mitchett's marriage has inevitably pleased least may be now rather to be feared." [...] These words had the sound of a climax, and she had brought them out as if, with her duty done, to leave them; but something that took place, for her eye, in the face Mr. Longdon had half-averted gave her after an instant what he might have called her second wind. [...] "Oh I know you think she always HAS been! But you've exaggerated--as to that; and I don't say that even at present it's anything we shan't get the better of. Only we must keep our heads.

5000|$|Thomas Hobbes {{distinguished}} absurdity from errors, including basic linguistic errors {{as when a}} word {{is simply}} {{used to refer to}} something which does not have that name. According to Aloysius Martinich: [...] "What Hobbes is <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> absurdity. Only human beings can embrace an absurdity, because only human beings have language, and philosophers are more susceptible to it than others". Hobbes wrote that [...] "words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call absurd, insignificant, and nonsense. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a round quadrangle; or, accidents of bread in cheese; or, immaterial substances; or of a free subject; a free will; or any free, but free from being hindered by opposition, I should not say he were in an error, but that his words were without meaning, that is to say, absurd". He distinguished seven types of absurdity. Below is the summary of Martinich, based on what he describes as Hobbes' [...] "mature account" [...] found in [...] "De Corpore" [...] 5., which all use examples that could be found in Aristotelian or scholastic philosophy, and all reflect [...] "Hobbes' commitment to the new science of Galileo and Harvey".

5000|$|The lyrics for Engine of a Million Plots {{were the}} primary focus of many {{critical}} reviews {{at the time of the}} album's release, noting the [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "serious" [...] nature of Reese Roper's lyrics in stark comparison to the band's earlier work which was largely characterized by humor, pop culture references and more overtly praise-centered messages. Much of Engine of a Million Plots deals with issues of doubt, adversity and religious frustration, as well as the renewal of faith and hope. In an interview with Relevant, Roper explained that he didn't care about his potentially alienating or controversial lyrics clashing with the wider Christian music market, noting [...] "For the most part, I think most of organized Christianity has kind of tossed Iron Frenzy off...What I'm more <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> the people that have been marginalized by the Church and those fans that used to be Christians and still love us. I really care about them. I want to write an album for those people". He elaborated about his frustrations with the Church, saying [...] "As time passes, I become more embarrassed about the Church, more embarrassed by the actions of Christians", acknowledging that the irreligious members of the band felt the same way: [...] "They have a lot of questions and a lot of searching, and it's the same for me. So I've tried to be more inclusive in writing lyrics". Roper has also commented that there is a threaded theme throughout the entirety of the album about [...] "being cold and in the dark versus fire and light".|$|E

Even worse than their lousy skills is the team's resigned and defeatist attitude, goofing off during practice with the attitude of [...] "why bother trying when we just will lose anyway?". This causes Coach Armstrong to crack up, and Miss Nelson sends him on vacation to regain his bearings. Later, Miss Nelson and Mr. Blandsworth overhear {{some of the students}} complain about the team at Lulu's ice cream parlor and the problem that Miss Viola Swamp isn't around at the moment, causing them to consider the matter seriously. Another problem the entire school is <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> that Thanksgiving will have the school's final game, and they are slated to take on the Central Werewolves, one of the city's most vicious teams. The next day, the team is momentarily shocked to hear Viola Swamp is back, only to find it is Blandsworth in a witch costume, to which he gets laughed off the field, with Blandsworth grumbling [...] "Oh Rats! How can they tell?" [...] But then Coach Swamp appears on the field and quickly puts the team in her control. Coach Swamp applies her trademark discipline to the team, demanding tough exercises and no back talk from the players. The team pulls together and sharpens their skills. When Coach Armstrong returns, the team was finally acting like a real football team. Finally, at the football game, the Tornadoes beat the Werewolves [...] "seventy-seven to three", and a pleased Blandsworth treats the whole team to hot dogs at Lulu's. In this book, Miss Nelson is spotted by Blandsworth grading papers while Coach Swamp is warning the team about misbehaving again - in the end it is revealed that Miss Nelson's twin sister Barbara filled in for her while she was assuming the identity of Miss Swamp (in the pictures, Miss Nelson isn't wearing a watch whereas Barbara is, and in the final picture Miss Swamp's sweatsuit is on Miss Nelson's bed and not Barbara's).|$|E

One of the key issues that the clients of banking structures are <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> the issue of identification {{of the degree of}} reliability and trust to the bank. As of now there are no common generally accepted methods of bank rating and the issue of bank reliability is rather problematic. The article considers a modern DEA method of economic and mathematical analysis which is a popular instrument of assessment of quality of services of different subjects and which became very popular in foreign econometric studies. The article demonstrates application of the data encapsulation method (data envelopment analysis, DEA) for obtaining new methods of development of bank ratings and marks out incoming and outgoing indicators for building a DEA model as applied to the Ukrainian banking system. The authors also discuss some methodical problems that might appear when applying component indicators for ranging the subjects and offer methods of their elimination...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{will look}} into the {{relationship}} between landscape and identity on the island nation of Kiribati, a low lying island nation in the Micronesian region of the Pacific that is currently under threat by climate change. Based on qualitative research from several islands in Kiribati (semi-structured interviews and observations), I explore how landscape and landscape changes, identity, and present and future challenges are perceived by Kiribati residents. Landscape {{is more than just}} physical surroundings, encompassing qualities of heritage, memory, skills, knowledge and learning, and there is a strong link between landscape and identity for Kiribati islanders. Respondents stressed the importance of community and the ‘simple life’ as important qualities of life in Kiribati. People still come together frequently in their communities where they discuss issues such as building a new house for someone. Communities have as main purpose helping each other and are based on strong bonds of love and friendship. Respondents defined the simple life as a life without violence, without having to worry about money, without any major natural disasters (apart from climate change), and a life in which people are open and friendly to everyone. When it comes to present and future challenges, most respondents were worried about issues related to environmental changes such as changes in fresh water resources and coastal erosion. Although many respondents felt the effect of these environmental changes and people have become more aware of the link between those and global warming, many residents remained sceptical towards climate change, simply because believing it would make it real. A future challenge respondents were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> the risk of having to resettle in the future. They are afraid that this will affect their community, their Kiribati identity, and that it would mean the loss of the simple life. For example, the idea exists that in other countries people will not smile on you on the street and that the only family you will have is your core family. Many people also never had to find a job {{and this is something that}} scares them as well. I conclude that landscape is a part of every aspect of life in Kiribati. Therefore it is strongly connected to the sense of identity of Kiribati islanders and many fear what will happen in the case of a radical landscape change...|$|E
