While this was in place the architectural paint analyst Lisa Oestreicher was able to examine the decorative scheme that had been used in the spaces and room frequented by the public. Three principal phases were identified: 1860s original; 1870s updates and adaptions; 1887–90 redecoration, which returned the main spaces to the original green colours and motifs created by Crace.

25|$|After {{the first}} World War the carpets {{started to be}} {{produced}} for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class {{of the twentieth century}} aspired to acquire a <b>Wilton</b> <b>carpet</b> for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.|$|E
2500|$|In 1733 Sir Darcey Levir, of Accrington, Lancashire, gave £50 {{towards a}} marble altar piece, {{of which there}} is no further record at the time, but which is {{believed}} to be the most recent and which was restored in the late Victorian period. In 17489 some very elaborate furniture of crimson velvet, crimson damask curtains and a <b>Wilton</b> <b>carpet,</b> were provided for the communion table, costing £140 13s. 4d. in total. At this time the altar was railed off, and the item of [...] "painting and gilding the ironwork to the altar rail £12 10s."

The two gilt chandeliers, now hanging, were given by William Drake of Shardeloes, in 1749, but for twenty-three years (from 1865 to 1887) were in Coleshill Church. The building had by this time been exposed to the trying atmosphere of Oxford for nearly one hundred years, and consequently sundry external repairs were necessary from time to time to keep the fabric in proper condition. £350 is spent in new slating, timber, and lead, in 1779. Fourteen years later one of the ends is scaffolded, and the vases taken down. Decay seems to have gone on gradually, and in 1817 the east end is reported to be very perishable, having decayed to the depth of 3 or 4 inches from its former surface.|$|E

By their smoky yellow glare I {{could see that the}} roof was, at least, fifty feet above us, and was hung by long lime-crystals, which sparkled and gleamed with great brightness. The floor of the cave was formed of fine sand, as soft and velvety as a <b>Wilton</b> <b>carpet,</b> sloping down in a way which showed that the cave must at its mouth open upon the sea, which was {{confirmed}} by the booming and splashing of the waves, and by the fresh salt air which filled the whole cavern.

60|$|A small {{side door}} {{led into the}} {{whitewashed}} corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of <b>Wilton</b> <b>carpet</b> in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured {{that it may have}} dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.|$|E
60|$|That was the {{residence}} of the principal citizen, {{all the way from}} the suburbs of New Orleans to the edge of St. Louis. When he stepped aboard a big fine steamboat, he entered a new and marvelous world: chimney-tops cut to counterfeit a spraying crown of plumes--and maybe painted red; pilot-house, hurricane deck, boiler-deck guards, all garnished with white wooden filigree work of fanciful patterns; gilt acorns topping the derricks; gilt deer-horns over the big bell; gaudy symbolical picture on the paddle-box, possibly; big roomy boiler-deck, painted blue, and furnished with Windsor armchairs; inside, a far-receding snow-white 'cabin;' porcelain knob and oil-picture on every stateroom door; curving patterns of filigree-work touched up with gilding, stretching overhead all down the converging vista; big chandeliers every little way, each an April shower of glittering glass-drops; lovely rainbow-light falling everywhere from the colored glazing of the skylights; the whole a long-drawn, resplendent tunnel, a bewildering and soul-satisfying spectacle! In the ladies' cabin a pink and white <b>Wilton</b> <b>carpet,</b> as soft as mush, and glorified with a ravishing pattern of gigantic flowers. Then the Bridal Chamber--the animal that invented that idea was still alive and unhanged, at that day--Bridal Chamber whose pretentious flummery was necessarily overawing to the now tottering intellect of that hosannahing citizen. Every state-room had its couple of cozy clean bunks, and perhaps a looking-glass and a snug closet; and sometimes there was even a washbowl and pitcher, and part of a towel which could be told from mosquito netting by an expert--though generally these things were absent, and the shirt-sleeved passengers cleansed themselves at a long row of stationary bowls in the barber shop, where were also public towels, public combs, and public soap.|$|E

5000|$|Mary Todd Lincoln's {{refurbishment}} of the White House in 1861 led {{to historic}} {{changes in the}} room. Mrs. Lincoln purchased two armchairs, a rosewood center table, a chest of drawers, four side balloon-back side chairs, a sofa, and—most importantly—a 6 ft wide, 8 ft long rosewood bed frame for the room. The headboard was pierced and richly carved with images of birds, grapes, and vines. The footboard featured similar, though more simply-carved, images. Attached to the headboard was a gilt canopy carved {{in the shape of}} a crown, with a shield in the front. Purple satin trimmed in gold lace hung from the canopy. This bed became known as the [...] "Lincoln bed", even though President Lincoln is not known to have slept in it.

Presented shortly after America 2 ̆ 7 s entrance into World War I and just weeks after Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s now-famous 2 ̆ 2 Fourteen Points 2 ̆ 2 speech, this 2 ̆ 2 Liberty Rug 2 ̆ 2 provided a symbolic narrative of the triumph of American progress while serving as physical proof of the country 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing prowess. More than just a chronicle of history, however, the Liberty Rug was an emblem of the period 2 ̆ 7 s cultural embrace of order and industry, as well as the fervent patriotism associated with Progressive-era political notions of expanding American democracy. This presentation will discuss the Karnak Liberty Rug 2 ̆ 7 s manufacture and primary motifs as they relate to issues of national identity, and political and industrial power in America during the war. A brief introduction will address the history of American carpet manufacture {{and the role of the}} Shuttleworth Brothers Company in particular.

50|$|One of {{the bridal}} suites was in Louis XV style, with satin brocade hangings and furniture, and {{curtains}} of Brussels point lace; {{and the other}} was {{in the style of the}} First Empire, with upholstering of French tapestry, and curtains of point lace. Each of the 350 rooms was furnished and decorated in a distinctive style. A special feature of each was an electric indicator by which a guest, without waiting for a bell-boy, could signal direct to the office for any of 140 various articles. This indicator, known as the Herzog Teleseme, was one of the conveniences of Holland House, serving as a signalling system. It consisted of a dial sunk into the wall, and connected by electricity with the office; upon this dial were printed 140 articles at times needed by travellers, and the guest moved the pointer until it pointed at the desired object, and then pressed an electric button, whereupon the clerk in the office sent up the desired newspaper, or bottle, or food, or any other needed thing. The rooms had brass bedsteads, red-birch woodwork, <b>Wilton</b> <b>carpets,</b> and modern furniture. Holland House was fire-proof, and contained sanitary plumbing. Its walls and floor-arches were of porous terra cotta, a nonconductor of heat, cold or noise. The heating pipes are encased in asbestos.|$|R
50|$|By the 17th century, weaving {{had become}} a large trade, and the carpet {{industry}} began in 1741, when two French weavers were brought in by Earl Henry Herbert of Pembroke to teach the local people new skills.
