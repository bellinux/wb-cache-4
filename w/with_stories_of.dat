5|$|McCarthy's {{committee}} {{then began}} {{an investigation into}} the United States Army. This began at the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy garnered some headlines <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but ultimately nothing came of this investigation. McCarthy next {{turned his attention to the}} case of a U.S. Army dentist who had been promoted to the rank of major despite having refused to answer questions on an Army loyalty review form. McCarthy's handling of this investigation, including a series of insults directed at a brigadier general, led to the Army-McCarthy hearings, with the Army and McCarthy trading charges and counter-charges for 36 days before a nationwide television audience. While the official outcome of the hearings was inconclusive, this exposure of McCarthy to the American public resulted in a sharp decline in his popularity. In less than a year, McCarthy was censured by the Senate and his position as a prominent force in anti-communism was essentially ended.|$|E
5|$|Operation Kugown was {{the name}} given to the {{psychological}} warfare operation that had played {{an important part in}} the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the Comite, so that the local agency could receive some credit. The Comite also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad ("Later We Discover the Truth"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.|$|E

25|$|The poems used in most Kurdish {{music are}} filled <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> romance and unrequited love. These poems have often two verses, which are divided in ten, eleven, or twelve syllables, and {{are based on}} the Gathas of the Zoroastrians. Kurdish melodies are very simple; their range is usually {{confined}} to a few notes. The form of the music is often strophic, and every gourani has a particular melody that is sung with various stanzas. At the end of every stanza the strophe is repeated unchanged throughout the song. Every gourani is characterized by a specific strophe. Similar to a lied or a chanson, gouranis may be accompanied by instrumental sections, which have three parts: prelude, middle section, and the ending. The prelude and the ending are performed by the group, and the middle section is performed in the form of call and response.|$|E
