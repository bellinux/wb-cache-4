Like {{elementary and middle school}} students, {{high school students}} have in addition two <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> for Christmas and New Year, and two <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> in March or April for Spring Break. Moreover, college students get four <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> for Christmas and New Year (from mid-December to mid-January) but only one week of Spring Break.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} 2007-2008 school year, Rochester Community Schools began a {{balanced}} school-year calendar, meaning that students {{go to school}} for nine weeks and then have two <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> throughout the school year. The first of the two <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> is an inter-session period where students who need help still attend school for extra help.|$|R

5|$|The season length {{was similar}} to the 2010 Claxton Shield by {{spreading}} ten rounds over twelve weeks, playing only the season's first game in the first week and taking a <b>week</b> <b>off</b> for Christmas and Boxing Day. Six teams were involved, playing a four-game series every week totaling two series against each team, one at home and one away. In total, the schedule allowed for 40regular season games per team before a four-team finals series. During the regular season, games were played Thursday to Sunday, varying depending on the series and team, with 18games scheduled as doubleheaders on a Saturday. Doubleheaders were scheduled to have the first of the two games shortened to seven innings, with the second game using the full nine innings.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, Foyt {{announced}} {{that at the}} end of the 2005 season, he would leave Foyt Enterprises and drive in the NASCAR Busch Series for the #38 Akins Motorsports team and was signed as a developmental driver for Evernham Motorsports. He ran several events in the #38 late in 2005, but failed to produce results. In 2006, he was scheduled to run the entire Busch Series schedule in the #38 and be a competitor for the Rookie of the Year award. However, early in the 2006 season, Akins was purchased by Braun Racing, which switched the #38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies. Foyt had an exclusive contract with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team. After a <b>week</b> <b>off,</b> Ray Evernham found him a ride with FitzBradshaw Racing, but he failed to qualify for his first race with the team and has not attempted a NASCAR race since.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{attaining}} the premiership, Chamberlain obtained {{passage of}} the Factories Act 1937. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. In 1938, Parliament enacted the Coal Act 1938, which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the Holidays with Pay Act. Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers a <b>week</b> <b>off</b> with pay, it led to a great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for the working classes. The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance and maintained rent control. Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect. In the event, it wasn't until 1 September 1972 when the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began 1964.|$|E
50|$|In Mexico, summer {{vacation}} starts in early July and finishes in mid-August since 2000. In addition, Mexican children get {{two or three}} <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> for Christmas and New Year (from the third Thursday in December to January 7), and two <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> in March or April for Spring Break (from the Friday before lazarus Saturday to the Monday after Easter Monday).|$|R
60|$|He {{accepted}} Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for {{an evening}} two <b>weeks</b> <b>off.</b> A dinner two <b>weeks</b> <b>off,</b> even a family dinner, never seems so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the National Football League {{experimented with}} a two-bye week format. After {{the success of}} {{expanding}} the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in the 1990 NFL season, the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue. However, teams felt that having two <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> {{during the regular season}} was too disruptive for their weekly routines, and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended. The negative effects of having two bye weeks can be similar to the negative effects of resting starters, as having several <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> (in the case of a division winner, several consecutive <b>weeks</b> <b>off),</b> a player's routine can be hurt.|$|R
5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have {{to remain on the}} island {{for more than a year}} unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day a <b>week</b> <b>off</b> work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a <b>week</b> <b>off</b> from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E
25|$|The Fall Series saw {{major changes}} for 2009, {{with one of}} its events moving to May and another {{dropping}} off the schedule entirely. It returned to its original start date of the week after the Tour Championship. Then, as in 2008, it took a <b>week</b> <b>off,</b> this time for the Presidents Cup. It then continued with events in three consecutive weeks, took another <b>week</b> <b>off</b> for the HSBC Champions (now elevated to World Golf Championships status), and concluded the week after that.|$|E
50|$|A month's {{availability}} at Ulithi {{to repair}} her damaged bow ended in late February and Guadalupe again steamed for battle, this time operating {{in support of}} the Iwo Jima invasion. After two <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> Iwo Jima, 24 February to 7 March, Guadalupe returned empty to Ulithi to prepare for her role in the bloody Okinawa campaign. Departing Ulithi 25 March 1945, Guadalupe spent three <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> Okinawa, returned to Ulithi for more fuel, and then spent another three <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> Okinawa. As the fierce struggle raged for this rockbound island, last step before the Japanese home islands, Guadalupe operated through heavy weather and high seas to provide other services, as well as her normal duties of refueling the giant invasion fleet, largest ever assembled in the Pacific.|$|R
