No longer a part of manager Kenny Dalglish's plans following the arrival of new midfielders including John Barnes, Wark was sold back to Ipswich on 4 January 1988 for £100,000.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{account of}} the origin of the Delphic oracle is provided in the Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo, which recent scholarship dates within a narrow range, c. 580–570 BC.

But Apollo, who had Delphinios as one of his cult epithets, leapt into the ship {{in the form of a}} dolphin (delphys", gen. [...] "delphinos). Dolphin-Apollo revealed himself to the terrified Cretans, and bade them follow him up to the [...] "place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have rich offerings". The Cretans [...] "danced in time and followed, singing Iē Paiēon, like the paeans of the Cretans in whose breasts the divine Muse has placed [...] "honey-voiced singing".

2500|$|Perhaps {{the climax}} of the feud came during Fred Allen's parody of popular quiz-and-prize show Queen for a Day, which was barely a year old when Allen decided to have a crack at it on The Fred Allen Show—an episode that has survived for today's {{listeners}} to appreciate. Calling the sketch [...] "King for a Day", Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot. Benny answered the prize-winning question correctly and Allen crowned him [...] "king" [...] and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes. Allen proudly announced, [...] "Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be the judge in a chicken-cleaning contest," [...] to which Benny joyously declared, [...] "I'm king for a day!" [...] At this point a professional pressing-iron was wheeled on stage, to press Benny's suit properly. It didn't matter that Benny was still in the suit. Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny's suit, one item at a time, ending with his trousers, each garment's removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience. As his trousers began to come off, Benny howled, [...] "Allen, you haven't seen the end of me!" [...] At once Allen shot back, [...] "It won't be long now!" ...|$|E
