50|$|Fasching’s <b>walk-in</b> <b>sculpture</b> Der Hammer des Thors/Thor’s Hammer, {{created in}} 1990 in the {{entrance}} hall of the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts (Museum für Angewandte Kunst - MAK), also emerged before {{the eyes of the}} museum’s visitors, thus enabling them to follow the process of creation. A further <b>walk-in</b> <b>sculpture</b> was created by Bernd Fasching in the Dominican Republic between 1996 and 1997. Terra Nova, the title of this walk-in formation of sculptures, depicts the landing place of Christopher Columbus on the island as an incentive to reflect on the checkered, often terrible History of the American Continents.|$|E
