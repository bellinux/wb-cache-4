5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> the camp.

5000|$|The story {{takes place}} {{primarily}} within Burland's capitol, a city once called [...] "Hart's Hope" [...] but eventually renamed Inwit. The city is notable for its multiple entrances, and the restrictions placed upon those <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> through those gates: a merchant <b>who</b> <b>enters</b> through the Asses' Gate is issued a pass which only allows him {{access to the}} commercial areas of the city, while a religious figure <b>who</b> <b>enters</b> through Gods' Gate can only visit the temples and so on. Beggars <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> through Piss Gate are granted a three-day pass during which to find work.

50|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} invitees i.e. Business Invitee and Public Invitee.

Licensee is a person <b>who</b> <b>enters</b> certain property with express or implied permission of the land occupier and no business purpose is involved.

5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months.

5|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at City College went {{through a series of}} further changes.

The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (<b>who</b> <b>entered</b> the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
