5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|Beaumont {{was fully}} {{involved}} in the political crises that punctuated the reign of Henry VI: Griffiths has labelled him one of 'a small group of like-minded men, led by Suffolk' who could work for the king <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> council or on royal progress, although his attendance at council seems to have become more sporadic by 1443. As Steward of England, he personally- although accompanied by, for example, other lords such as Buckingham and the earl of Salisbury- arrested Humphrey, duke of Gloucester for treason, in Bury St Edmunds 18 February 1447.|$|E

5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany {{was beginning to}} have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> the war zone or not.|$|E

Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E

5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some lands to the Livonian Order – portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava—although his control over these western lands was tenuous. There {{has been much}} discussion among historians as to <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> later years (1255–1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order; the case for this scenario is bolstered {{by the fact that}} some of the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals.|$|E
5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E

5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight {{that could result in}} overheating. Other species make nests above ground, <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E

5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – <b>whether</b> <b>in</b> nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
