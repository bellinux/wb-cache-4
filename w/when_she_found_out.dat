5|$|Tatlock {{broke up}} with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August that year he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening Harrison, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Harrison had been married three times previously. Her first {{marriage}} lasted only a few months. Her second husband was Joe Dallet, {{an active member of}} the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She finally asked Harrison for a divorce <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in Reno, Nevada, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth husband on November 1, 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E

In December 2006, Nick and Phyllis welcomed a baby girl, Summer Newman.|$|E
25|$|Her mother threw Rita out of {{the house}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that her {{daughter}} was collaborating with the police. She did not care that her own son's killer was to be brought to justice; in her opinion – and the deep-rooted Mafia culture she belonged to – the police were {{on the wrong side of}} the law. Rita was relocated to a safe house in a seventh-floor flat on the outskirts of Rome, where the only people she knew were her police guards. Borsellino became her lifeline.|$|E
500|$|Later {{that year}} the serial {{included}} a storyline which was branded [...] "bizarre" [...] after it mirrored {{a real life}} scandal that had occurred weeks earlier. Lewis who plays love interest Geoff had been {{caught up in a}} sex tape scandal which leaked onto the internet, the serial decided to include Nicole making a sex tape with Trey Palmer (Luke Bracey) and having it leaked. Trey filmed without Nicole's consent, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the truth she ended their relationship. Trey thought she and Geoff were getting back together so aired the tape at a local film festival to gain revenge. James described Nicole's state of mind adding, [...] "She's quite vulnerable at the moment, with her dad, Roman, in prison. She's relying on Trey, so this is the last thing she needs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gandhari's {{marriage}} was arranged to Dhritarashtra, the eldest prince of the Kuru kingdom, a region in Delhi and Haryana region. The Mahabharata depicted {{her as a}} beautiful and virtuous woman and a very dedicated wife. Gandhari was married with Dhritarashtra, king of Hastinapur. Their {{marriage was}} arranged by Bhishma. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> it <b>out</b> that her would-be husband was born blind, she decided to blindfold herself {{in order to be}} like her husband. What was going through the young girl's mind <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> it <b>out</b> that <b>she</b> was going to marry a blind man is not depicted in the epic. Popular narration said that the act of blindfolding herself was a sign of dedication and love. On the other hand, Irawati Karve and many modern scholars debated that the act of blindfolding was an act of protest against Bhishma, as he forced her father to give away her hand in marriage with the blind prince of Hastinapur.|$|R

Tell John, when you speak to him, that I am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept {{in close contact with}} her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E

Amanda Fairbank-Hynes was cast in the role, on which she stated, [...] "It all happened so quickly but I'm really excited to be working on EastEnders. It's an amazing group of people and they are great to work with." [...] Fairbank-Hynes attended five auditions for the part, and she found out she got the part two days before filming started. She stated that she was pleased <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> as attending that many auditions—the most she had auditioned for any part—made her want the part more. The character was still being written and changed a lot during the audition process. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier {{performed}} Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, {{and sang}} in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She {{returned to the}} Netherlands in January 1949 {{for a series of}} recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated [...] "this abominable accompanist" [...] who deserved [...] "a kick in the pants". <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: [...] "What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.|$|E

She has a [...] "peace at any price" [...] principle, leading her to deny Ayumu's declaration of teasing by passing {{it off as}} [...] "Ayumu's fault" [...] (Volume 6 of the manga). She is shown as very sympathetic towards Katsumi and Manami. During summer vacation, Ms. Toda starts dating Katsumi and is seen kissing him on a beach by Manami's group. <b>When</b> <b>she's</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> by Manami, <b>she</b> promises Manami to help her {{to get rid of}} Miki in exchange of her silence. Her actions, however, backfire and Manami blackmails her with the beach photo but Ms. Toda decides to speak the truth. As a result of that, she is forced to resign but teaches somewhere else. In the drama, she dates Katsumi; to keep anyone else from finding out (save for Manami, who had already figured it out), she frames Ayumu by blaming her for all the bullying that goes on at Nishikō, even though they [...] "both" [...] know full well that Ayumu is the victim, rather than the one behind it.|$|R

500|$|Commentators {{attempted}} {{to tie the}} characters in the song to specific people in Dylan's personal life in 1965. In his book , Andy Warhol recalled that some people in his circle believed that [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] contained hostile references to him; he was told, [...] "Listen to 'Like a Rolling Stone'—I think you're the diplomat on the chrome horse, man." [...] The reason behind Dylan's alleged hostility to Warhol was supposedly Warhol's treatment of actress and model Edie Sedgwick. It has been suggested that Sedgwick is the basis of the Miss Lonely character. Sedgwick was briefly involved with Dylan in late 1965 and early 1966, around which time there was some discussion of the two making a movie together. According to Warhol's collaborator Paul Morrissey, Sedgwick may have been in love with Dylan, and was shocked <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that Dylan had secretly married Sara Lownds in November 1965. However, in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, Michael Gray argues that Sedgwick had no connection with [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", but states [...] "there's no doubt that the ghost of Edie Sedgwick hangs around Blonde on Blonde".|$|E

Along with May, Justin Shirley Smith also played guitars; Gene Grimaldi mastered the track. Olle Romo did additional recording and programming. Gaga teased that [...] "someone legendary" [...] would be producing the track before production credits were announced in April 2011. Gaga, a Queen fan (even taking her stage {{name from the}} Queen song [...] "Radio Ga Ga"), admitted to [...] " [...] to the floor crying and laughing" [...] <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that May agreed to the collaboration. Lange asked Gaga to record a [...] "rough lead vocal" [...] for the track while she was touring. Gaga later recalled: [...] "I had about 30cigarettes {{and a couple of}} glasses of Jameson and just put on a click track and sang my face off, thinking we'd redo the vocals." [...] However, Lange was satisfied with her recording and used it on the track. Ware recalled that the song was recorded the night after Gaga's March 17, 2011, concert for The Monster Ball Tour. She welcomed his opinions and encouraged his input which he said helped make the four-hour session the best working experience he has had with a celebrity. [...] "She was flattering toward the studio — and Omaha, too, for that matter. She is a bright young lady with remarkable music instincts who charts her own path," [...] he added.|$|E

Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: [...] "Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that they'd put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry. … She wanted to go to Washington to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn't let her because it would be unpatriotic."
