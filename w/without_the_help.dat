Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached.

5|$|The new candle was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp.

5|$|Arjona's primary musical {{style is}} Latin pop. He usually sings <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of {{featured}} or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona took risks {{to keep his}} music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden Déjame Decir Que Te Amo, on the following two albums Arjona experimented {{with a range of}} pop/rock styles. Animal Nocturno intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the instrumentation is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums. On Historias, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and Hammond B-3, and strings. On Si El Norte Fuera El Sur, he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring and are performed acoustically with Caribbean touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.|$|E
5|$|Like Wollstonecraft's first novel, , The Wrongs of Woman {{is heavily}} autobiographical; the two novels even repeat {{many of the}} same biographical details. After being {{abandoned}} by her lover and the father of her child, Gilbert Imlay (the model for Darnford), Wollstonecraft attempted to commit suicide. Her despair over these events is written into the book as well as many other experiences from the mid-1790s. Moreover, Maria Venables's family history shows clear similarities to Wollstonecraft's own. Like Maria, Wollstonecraft had a mother who favored an elder brother and she also devotedly cared for that mother during her dying days, only to be pushed away during the final moments of her life. Wollstonecraft also looked after her sisters like Maria does, albeit <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of a wealthy uncle. Perhaps most strikingly, Wollstonecraft's sister Eliza left her husband, at Wollstonecraft's prodding, much as Maria leaves hers. As Kelly explains, autobiography is common in Jacobin novels. Philosophical novels were expected to be autobiographical; audiences believed that the philosophizing novelists would draw on their own experiences in order to illustrate their abstract principles.|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of meta-cognitive <b>help</b> in <b>the</b> context of {{learning}} by teaching. Students learned to solve algebraic equations by tutoring a teachable agent, called SimStudent, using an online learning environment, called APLUS. A version of APLUS was developed to provide meta-cognitive help on what problems students should teach, as well as when to quiz SimStudent. A classroom study comparing APLUS with and <b>without</b> <b>the</b> meta-cognitive <b>help</b> was conducted with 173 seventh to ninth grade students. The data showed that students with <b>the</b> meta-cognitive <b>help</b> showed better problem selection and scored higher on the post-test than those who tutored SimStudent <b>without</b> <b>the</b> meta-cognitive <b>help.</b> These results suggest that, when carefully designed, learning by teaching can support students to not only learn cognitive skills but also employ meta-cognitive skills for effective tutoring. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|R

5|$|The {{region of}} a {{planetary}} system {{adjacent to the}} giant planets will be influenced in a different way. In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that {{a huge number of}} small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The text {{virtually}} ignores {{his wife}} and family, but Cibber wrote in detail about {{his time in the}} theatre, especially his early years as a young actor at Drury Lane in the 1690s, giving a vivid account of the cut-throat theatre company rivalries and chicanery of the time, as well as providing pen portraits of the actors he knew. The Apology is vain and self-serving, as both his contemporaries and later commentators have pointed out, but it also serves as Cibber's rebuttal to his harshest critics, especially Pope. For the early part of Cibber's career, it is unreliable in respect of chronology and other hard facts, understandably, since it was written 50 years after the events, apparently <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of a journal or notes. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source for all aspects of the early 18th-century theatre in London, for which documentation is otherwise scanty. Because he worked with many actors from the early days of Restoration theatre, such as Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth Barry {{at the end of their}} careers, and lived to see David Garrick perform, he is a bridge between the earlier mannered and later more naturalistic styles of performance.|$|E
5|$|Using the French ports, U-boats {{targeted}} many {{of their}} victims just east of 20°W. The services set up the ACHQ (Area Combined Headquarters) for A/S operations in the Atlantic. Organisation and inter-service was born, and became the ‘nerve centre’ of the Atlantic war.

RAF Fighter Command was to receive the priority, to make good losses from the Battle of Britain. During 1 October to 1 December 1940, 100 Allied ships were sunk. In the First Happy Time, May 1940 to 2 December 1940, the U-boats sank 298 ships for more than 1.6 million tons, almost all in the Northwest Approaches. This included 37 tankers (27 British).
