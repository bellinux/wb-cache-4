5|$|Meanwhile, Bart enlists Lisa to {{help find}} out what Sideshow Bob is up to, but only ends up being {{discovered}} rummaging in Bob's trash and angrily escorted home by him. They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> reveals {{that he is the}} one who embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to blow it up, taking the money with him.|$|E

25|$|On 6 March 1907, {{the steel}} barque Dundonald was wrecked on Disappointment Island (in the Auckland group). The island lacked a depot, and the 17 castaways (from {{a crew of}} 28) subsisted on what water and food they could find (mainly mollymawks and seals) and dug crude sand shelters. Using wood {{scavenged}} {{on the island and}} canvas from the ship's sails, they crafted a crude coracle to bear four men across the seven-mile strait to Auckland Island in search of depots. After several attempts and the loss of two boats, they made a successful crossing to the island in October and journeyed across it to the depot. They found a boat at the depot along with the supplies, so after making sails from their clothing, the four men sailed back to Disappointment Island to retrieve their shipmates and return to the depot. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> ammunition, the castaways were able to supplement their diet with wild cattle hunted on Rose and Enderby Islands. They were picked up by the Hinemoa on 16 November, and (once Captain Bollons had completed his steamship's survey of the Campbell and Antipodes Islands) were taken to Bluff.|$|E
