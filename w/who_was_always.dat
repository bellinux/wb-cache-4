5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E
5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, Helen Forrest {{recorded}} more than 500 songs. In 2001, she was posthumously inducted into the now-defunct Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.

25|$|When {{asked who}} the models for her characters, Loos would almost always {{say they were}} {{composites}} of various people, but when pressed, admitted that toothless flirt Sir Francis Beekman was modeled after writer Joseph Hergesheimer and producer Jesse L.

Dorothy Shaw was modeled after herself and Constance Talmadge, and Lorelei herself most closely resembled acquisitive Ziegfeld showgirl, Lillian Lorraine, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> looking for new places to display the diamonds bestowed by her suitors.|$|E

Williams, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{more interested in the}} Constructors' title than the Drivers' as it showed that his team was the best, refused to do this, rightly believing that having two proven F1 winners in Piquet and Mansell would better-serve the team than Nakajima would as an F1 rookie.|$|E
25|$|Karreman was an {{exceptionally}} devoted educator, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> supportive {{of his research}} associates, family, and friends; he was a generous man, obviously having not forgotten Rashevsky's help in his early life at the University of Chicago. He had {{a wide range of}} interests in his readings, a keen interest in the fine arts—such as paintings, was an advanced chess player, and a most devoted husband and father. Between 1987 and 1997, he frequently travelled to the Pacific Northwest where his son and daughter had their homes and children.|$|E
25|$|Precocious and intelligent, Victoria {{quickly learned}} French {{at the age}} of {{eighteen}} months, and she began to study German when aged four. From the age of six, her curriculum included lessons of arithmetic, geography and history, while her father tutored her in politics and philosophy. Her school days, interrupted by three hours of recreation, began at 8:20 and finished at 18:00. Unlike her brother, whose educational program was even more severe, Victoria {{turned out to be an}} excellent student <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> hungry for knowledge.

He obtained a position as an official in the government's Finance Ministry and was set up for a promising career. However, Mishima had exhausted himself so much that his father agreed to his resigning from the position {{during the first year of}} employment in order to devote himself to writing.|$|E
25|$|Orwell's {{novel was}} adapted for {{television}} by Nigel Kneale, {{one of the}} most prolific television scriptwriters of the time. The previous year he had created the character of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the popular science-fiction serial The Quatermass Experiment. The adaptation was produced and directed by the equally respected Rudolph Cartier, perhaps the BBC's best producer-director of the 1950s <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> adventurous artistically and technically. Cartier, a veteran of the UFA film studios in 1930s Germany who had fled the Nazi regime for Britain in 1936, had worked with Kneale the previous year on The Quatermass Experiment and was a veteran of many television drama productions.|$|E
25|$|The {{deck and}} command crew (hypēresia) was {{headed by the}} helmsman, the kybernētēs, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> an {{experienced}} seaman and was often the actual commander of the vessel. These experienced sailors were to {{be found on the}} upper levels of the triremes. Other officers were the bow lookout (prōreus or prōratēs), the boatswain (keleustēs), the quartermaster (pentēkontarchos), the shipwright (naupēgos), the piper (aulētēs) who gave the rowers' rhythm and two superintendents (toicharchoi), in charge of the rowers {{on each side of the}} ship. What constituted these sailors' experience was a combination of superior rowing skill (physical stamina and/or consistency in hitting with a full stroke) and previous battle experience. The sailors were likely in their thirties and forties. In addition, there were ten sailors handling the masts and the sails.|$|E

25|$|In 1885 Hobhouse {{accepted}} a peerage as Baron Hobhouse, of Hadspen in the County of Somerset, {{with a view}} to assisting in the judicial work of the House of Lords, but a statutory qualification by which only judges of the high courts of the United Kingdom could sit to hear appeals had been overlooked. In 1887 the disqualification was removed by Act of Parliament in regard to members of the Judicial Committee; but Hobhouse did not take up the work of a judge in the House of Lords. He only sat there to try three cases, in two of which, Russell v. Countess of Russell (1897 Appeal Cases 395) and the Kempton Park case (1899 Appeal Cases 143), he was in a dissenting minority. As a judge Hobhouse, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> careful and painstaking, invariably stated the various arguments fully and fairly, but he was tenacious of his deliberately formed opinion.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} duty of RAT Parents was to haze freshman {{members of}} the band and enforce RAT Rules. The modern role of RAT Parents is to welcome freshman band members, teach them Georgia Tech and band traditions, help them adjust to life at Tech and in the band and {{to act as a}} friend and advisor to them. In {{the early days of the}} tradition, there was just a Rat Mom, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a male band member. Since the mid-1980s, there has been both a RAT Mom and a RAT Dad, the latter of which is always a female band member. Until 1990, the selection of Rat Parents was fairly informal. From 1990 to 1993, RAT Parents were selected by the band's executive board, partly to keep the decision in the hands of the students. When the executive board was dissolved in 1993, the selection was made by the director of bands following an interview process. New RAT Parents are announced along with the new drum majors for the upcoming year.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Galligan, {{many of the}} supporting actors and actresses were better known. Veteran actor Glynn Turman portrayed the high school science teacher whose study of a newborn Mogwai leads to his death after it forms a cocoon and emerges as a vicious gremlin. Dick Miller, who was a regular in Dante's films, was another experienced actor on the set, playing a World War II veteran who first refers to the creatures as gremlins. Rand was played by Hoyt Axton, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the filmmakers' preferred choice for the role {{even though it was}} widely contested by other actors. Axton's experience included acting as the father in The Black Stallion (1979), and he was also a country music singer-songwriter. After an introductory scene to Gremlins was cut, Axton's voice earned him the added role of the narrator to establish some context. Mr. Wing was played by Keye Luke, a renowned film actor, whose film career spanned half a century. Although in reality he was around 80 at the time of filming, and his character was very elderly, Luke's youthful appearance had to be covered by make-up.|$|E

25|$|His {{two sons}} {{followed}} him, {{as soon as}} their existing engagements allowed them to leave Leicestershire. The younger, John, who married in 1816, became his father's curate, and the elder, who married a year later, became curate at Pucklechurch, also nearby. Crabbe's reputation as a poet continued to grow in these years. His growing reputation soon made him a welcome guest in many houses to which his position as vicar of Trowbridge might not have admitted him. Nearby was the poet William Lisle Bowles, who introduced Crabbe to the noble family at Bowood House, home of the Marquess of Lansdowne, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> ready to welcome those distinguished in literature and the arts. It was at Bowood House that Crabbe first met the poet Samuel Rogers, who became a close friend and had an influence on Crabbe's poetry. In 1817, {{on the recommendation of}} Rogers, Crabbe stayed in London from the middle of June to the end of July in order to enjoy the literary society of the capital. While there he met Thomas Campbell, and through him and Rogers was introduced to his future publisher John Murray.|$|E
25|$|Krohn's {{work also}} {{sheds light on}} Hitchcock's {{practice}} of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis). Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency of giving himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this {{and a great deal}} of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. His fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each film poster for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as Bill Gold and Saul Bass—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.|$|E
25|$|After World War II {{the term}} School of Paris often {{referred}} to Tachisme, the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to Cobra. In 1952 Michel Tapié authored the book Un Autre art which gave name and voice to Informalism. Important proponents being Jean Dubuffet, Pierre Soulages, Nicolas de Staël, Hans Hartung, Serge Poliakoff, and Georges Mathieu, among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (<b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a figurative artist), and de Staël, abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and {{he became one of}} the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American Bay Area Figurative Movement, as many of those abstract painters like Richard Diebenkorn, David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Wayne Thiebaud, Nathan Oliveira, Joan Brown and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction of the 1960s and 1970s. Nicolas de Staël's bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.|$|E
