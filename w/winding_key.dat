50|$|They {{were the}} most common type of watch from their {{development}} in the 16th century until wristwatches became popular after World War I during which a transitional design, trench watches, were used by the military. Pocket watches generally have an attached chain to allow them to be secured to a waistcoat, lapel, or belt loop, and to prevent them from being dropped. Watches were also mounted on a short leather strap or fob, when a long chain would have been cumbersome or likely to catch on things. This fob could also provide a protective flap over their face and crystal. Women's watches were normally of this form, with a watch fob that was more decorative than protective. Chains were frequently decorated with a silver or enamel pendant, often carrying the arms of some club or society, which by association also became known as a fob. Ostensibly practical gadgets such as a watch <b>winding</b> <b>key,</b> vesta case, or a cigar cutter also appeared on watch chains, although usually in an overly decorated style. Also common are fasteners designed to be put through a buttonhole and worn in a jacket or waistcoat, this sort being frequently associated with and named after train conductors.|$|E

A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) analysis have been completed resulting in the identification of high risk components within the design. The design has been analyzed from a commercial and economic point of view and Cost of Energy (COE) calculations have been carried out with the potential to reduce COE by up to 18 % when compared with a permanent magnet direct drive 5 MW baseline machine, resulting in a potential COE of 0. 075 $/kWh.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{present the}} {{investigation}} on transient over voltage that appears across the motor terminals when motor is supplied with a sinusoidal supply {{and with a}} PWM converter. When motor is operated on sinusoidal supply, then during switching period voltage across motor phase becomes equal to supply line voltage and the maximum voltage across any of the coil obtained is 30 % more than the rated value. Unexpected behaviour was observed in variation of coil voltage (harmonic voltage after few cycle from starting) with sinusoidal supply during starting, however this is not producing large over voltages or high dv/dt. Voltage rise time when motor is supplied with converter is very small and is {{of the order of}} micro second. In some cases the peak voltage at motor terminals reaches to value which more than twice the value of dc link voltage and rated line to line voltage of the motor. The distribution of voltage during switching condition is not even among the coils of a winding and hence turns. The voltage drop in coils near the terminal is more than that of in other coils. The measured voltage drop across first coil from terminal of winding of four coils in series is varying 30 to 65. 8 % of the phase voltage against 25 % of the phase voltage. Comparison of wave forms for sinusoidal supply and inverter supply shows that distortions were very large with inverter supply which increases the losses and produces more stresses on the insulations.

Observational clues as {{to the existence of}} such outflows in radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are provided, for instance, by blue shifted absorption lines in Seyferts and Broad Absorption Line Quasi Stellar Objects (BAL QSOs). We study a model for wind-type flows in Seyfert 1 s and explore the physical conditions of the outflowing gas, taking into account explicitly both heating and cooling processes, including Compton interaction with radiation.

An overall goal is to illuminate the rich physics of radiative driving and the challenges that lie ahead in developing dynamical models that can explain the broad scaling of mass loss rate and flow speed with stellar properties, as well as the often complex structure and variability observed in massive-star outflows.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of winds on the time {{evolution}} of isothermal, self-gravitating accretion discs by adopting a radius-dependent mass-loss rate because of the existence of the wind. Our similarity and semi-analytical solution describes time evolution of the system in the slow accretion limit. The disc structure is distinct in the inner and outer parts, irrespective of the existence of the wind. We show that the existence of wind will lead to a reduction of the surface density in the inner and outer parts of the disc in comparison to a no-wind solution. Also, the radial velocity significantly increases in the outer part of the disc, however, the accretion rate decreases due to the reduced surface density in comparison to the no-wind solution. In the inner part of the disc, mass loss due to the wind is negligible according to our solution. But the radial size of this no-wind inner region becomes smaller for stronger <b>winds.</b> <b>Key</b> words: accretion, accretion discs – stars: formation – quasars: general...|$|R

30|$|We found a {{new class}} of {{solutions}} for MHD equations that satisfies the condition that cylindrical flux ropes can expand self-similarly even when the polytropic index γ is larger than 1. We achieved this by including the effects of elongation along the symmetry axis as well as radial expansion and assuming that the radial expansion rate {{is the same as the}} elongation rate. In previous studies (Osherovich et al., 1993 a, 1995), a class of self-similar solutions was described for which cylindrical flux ropes expand only in the medium where γ is less than 1. We compare the models including elongation and excluding elongation observationally by using the <b>WIND</b> <b>key</b> parameters. The difference in the fitting results of the magnetic field between these two models is slight. However the fitting of the velocity is improved when elongation is included and when new geometric parameters that are necessary to represent the elongation are introduced. The values of these parameters are almost the same scale as the radius of flux ropes, which is consistent with the assumption of the isotropic expansion. This new exact solution to a time-dependent two-dimensional MHD problem can also be used to test numerical codes.|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamical winds from a spherical two-temperature plasma {{surrounding}} a compact object are constructed. The mass-loss rate is computed {{as a function}} of electron temperature, optical depth and luminosity of the sphere, the values of which can be constrained by the fitting of the spectral energy distributions for known X-ray binary systems. The sensitive dependence of the mass loss rate with these parameters leads to the identification of two distinct regions in the parameter space separating wind-dominated from non wind dominated systems. A critical optical depth (τc), {{as a function of}} luminosity and electron temperature, is defined which differentiates these two regions. Systems with optical depths significantly smaller than τc are wind-dominated. The results are applied to black hole candidate X-ray binary systems in the hard spectral state (Cyg X- 1, GX 339 - 4 and Nova Muscae), and it is found that the inferred optical depth (τ) is similar to τc suggesting that they are wind regulated systems. On the other hand, for X-ray binary systems containing a neutron star (e. g., Cyg X- 2) τ is much larger than τc indicating the absence of significant hydrodynamical <b>winds.</b> <b>Key</b> words: binaries: accretion, accretion-discs- black hole physics- hydrodynamic...|$|R
