The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.|$|E

Despite early successes however, the team had an inconsistent season.

2500|$|The Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility {{commenced}} {{an investigation}} into the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys. [...] Their report was issued in September 2008. [...] The report cited serious issues of accountability removing a few of the U.S. Attorneys, but there was no finding that the nine U.S. Attorneys were removed for illegal or improper reasons. [...] To the contrary, the report concluded that Margaret Chiara and Kevin Ryan were removed appropriately for management issues. [...] Paul Charlton was removed for his action relating to a death penalty case and unilateral implementation of an interrogation policy. [...] The report found Carol Lam was removed because of the Justice Department's concerns about the low number of gun and immigration prosecutions in her district. [...] The report concluded John McKay was asked to leave because of his disagreement with the Deputy Attorney General over an information-sharing program. [...] The report could not cite to a reason Dan Bogden was asked to leave, but there was no finding that anything illegal or improper occurred with his removal. [...] The report concluded Bud Cummins was asked to leave to make room for another political appointee that he himself conceded under oath was qualified to serve as a U.S. Attorney. [...] These findings were consistent with testimony given by Gonzales. [...] Politics was clearly involved. [...] Likewise, the report concluded Todd Graves was removed to settle a political dispute in Missouri. [...] Again, this was motivated by politics. [...] Finally, the report found that it could not conclude that David Iglesias was removed for an improper reason. [...] However, since the IG had no authority to investigate Congress or the White House, the IG asked Attorney General Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Iglesias removal. This special prosecutor found no wrongdoing in the removal of David Iglesias. [...] The DOJ IG found no criminal wrongdoing in the records. [...] As the Wall Street Journal reported [...] "the Justice Department informed Congress on <b>Wednesday</b> <b>that</b> a special investigator in the case found no evidence of wrongdoing….the investigator's final word is that no Administration official gave 'false statements' to Congress or to the DOJ Inspector General, which carried out their own investigation." [...] In particular, the report found no evidence that Gonzales made false or misleading statements to Congress, thus clearing him of accusations of perjury.|$|E
