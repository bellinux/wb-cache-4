25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> {{to be accomplished}} {{by the end of}} the course. Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers will know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> to be accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E

25|$|With a {{clear sense}} of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> to be accomplished, {{instructors}} will be able to structure their lessons around the studentâ€™s needs. OBE does not specify a specific method of instruction, leaving instructors free to teach their students using any method. Instructors will also be able to recognize diversity among students by using various teaching and assessment techniques during their class. OBE is meant to be a student-centered learning model. Teachers are meant to guide and help the students understand the material in any way necessary, study guides, and group work are some of the methods instructors can use to facilitate students learning.|$|E
25|$|A coxswain is {{the coach}} in the boat, in {{addition}} to following the orders of the team coach, the coxswain {{is connected to the}} way the boat feels, what's working, <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> to be changed, and how. A successful coxswain must keep track of the drill, time, pace, words of the coach, feel of the boat, direction of the boat, and safety. During a race, a coxswain is responsible for steering, calling the moves, and responding to the way the other boats are moving. Success depends on the physical and mental strength of the rowers, ability to respond to the environment, {{and the way in which}} the coxswain motivates the rowers, not only as individuals but as members of the crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E

500|$|Sociology {{and applied}} {{sociology}} {{are connected to}} the professional and academic discipline of social work. Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual. However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems. For example, a sociologist might study why a community is plagued with poverty. The applied sociologist would be more focused on practical strategies on <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> to be done to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on action; implementing theses strategies [...] "directly" [...] or [...] "indirectly" [...] by means of mental health therapy, counselling, advocacy, community organization or community mobilization.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} year {{following}} the election defeat, Romney generally kept a low profile, with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses. In December 2012, he joined the board of Marriott International for a third stint as a director. In March 2013, Romney gave a reflective interview on Fox News Sunday, stating, [...] "It kills me not to be there, {{not to be in}} the White House doing <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> to be done". He again expressed regret at the [...] "47 percent" [...] remark, saying [...] "There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign." [...] (He was still echoing both of these sentiments a year later.) [...] Romney began working as executive partner group chairman for Solamere Capital, a private capital firm in Boston owned by his son Tagg. He was also involved in supporting several charitable causes.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{wrote the}} cantata in 1723 {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig for the 13th Sunday after Trinity. The {{prescribed}} readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's teaching on law and promise (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Good Samaritan (...) [...] The cantata text was written by Johann Oswald Knauer and appeared in Gotha in 1720 in [...] (Holy singing and playing to God). The text relates closely to the readings, even to the situation in which the parable was told, referring to the question of a lawyer <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> to be done to achieve eternal life. The answer, which the lawyer had to give himself, was the commandment to love God and your neighbour. This, the Great Commandment, is the text of the first movement. Accordingly, the following text is divided in two parts, one recitative and aria dealing with the love of God, and a symmetrical part handling the love of the neighbour.|$|E
