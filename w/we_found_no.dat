500|$|The trophy was {{presented}} by former Cambridge student Prince Edward. Cambridge stroke John Pritchard said [...] "After our initial start we built up for 20 strokes, steadied {{and then just}} grinded away." [...] He added [...] "I was just stirring the tea while the others did the work." [...] Cambridge cox Carole Burton noted [...] "I went where I wanted to go." [...] Following tradition, Pritchard picked her up and threw her into the river. Oxford's Jones remarked [...] "we were as well prepared as last year but <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> magic." [...] Topolski conceded that even had Oxford been at their best, they would still have lost the race.|$|E
2500|$|Many criticisms {{leveled against}} Allstate (and other insurers), {{including}} Barardinelli's book, involved {{the use of}} a software program called [...] "Colossus" [...] to process claims. [...] In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies {{in the manner in which}} Colossus was used. [...] It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the allegations, an {{investigation}} {{conducted by the}} US Inspector General, {{at the request of}} US Senator Christopher Dodd, requested a review of American activities leading up to and during the coup attempt. The OIG report found no [...] "wrongdoing" [...] by US officials either in the State Department or in the Embassy, and concluded that [...] "While it is clear that NED’s, DOD’s, and other U.S. assistance programs provided training, institution building, and other support to organizations and individuals understood to be actively involved in the events of April 11–14, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> evidence that this support directly contributed, or was intended to contribute, to those events. NED is, however, mindful of the fact that, in some circumstances, its efforts to assist specific organizations, or foster open elections, could be perceived as partisan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hastings and Eric Bates, {{executive}} editor of Rolling Stone, repeatedly defended the accuracy of Hastings' article. An inquiry by the Defense Department inspector general {{found no evidence of}} wrongdoing by McChrystal or his military and civilian associates. The Pentagon report also challenged the accuracy of Hastings' article, disputing key incidents or comments reported in it. The report from the inquiry states: [...] "In some instances, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> witness who acknowledged making or hearing the comments as reported. In other instances, we confirmed that the general substance of an incident at issue occurred, but not in the exact context described in the article." [...] In response, Rolling Stone stated that “the report by the Pentagon’s inspector general offers no credible source—or indeed, any named source—contradicting the facts as reported in our story." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Harriet Sherwood, {{writer for}} the Guardian, even if Hamas were violating the law on this matter, it would not legally justify Israel's bombing of areas where {{civilian}}s are known to be. Amnesty International stated that [...] "Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks (where the likely number of civilian casualties or damage to civilian property outweighs the anticipated military advantage to be gained) are … prohibited." [...] It said that [...] "Israel's relentless air assault on Gaza has seen its forces flagrantly disregard civilian life and property". Human Rights Watch has said {{that in many cases}} [...] "the Israeli military has presented no information to show that it was attacking lawful military objectives or acted to minimize civilian casualties." [...] An investigation by Human Rights Watch found that [...] "in most of the sites we investigated so far (in this conflict) <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> valid military targets". A high-level group of former diplomats and military experts concluded that [...] "the IDF acted within the bounds of international law during the war." [...] The Israeli government issued a report saying that its military actions were [...] "lawful and legitimate" [...] and that [...] "Israel made substantial efforts to avoid civilian deaths." [...] The High Level Military Group, composed of military experts from Australia, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Britain, the United States, and Spain, released an assessment on Operation Protective Edge acknowledging Israel made [...] "unprecedented efforts" [...] to avoid civilian casualties exceeding international standards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAbdominal {{patterning}} in Drosophila {{requires the}} function of Nanos (nos) and Pumilio (pum) to repress posterior translation of hunchback mRNA. Here we provide the first functional analysis of nanos and pumilio genes during blastodermal patterning of a short-germ insect. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that <b>nos</b> and pum in {{the red flour beetle}} Tribolium castaneum crucially contribute to posterior segmentation by preventing hunchback translation. While this function seems to be conserved among insects, we provide evidence that Nos and Pum may also act on giant expression, another gap gene. After depletion of nos and pum by parental RNAi, Hunchback and giant remain ectopically at the posterior blastoderm and the posterior Krüppel (Kr) domain is not being activated. giant may be a direct target of Nanos and Pumilio in Tribolium and presumably prevents early Kr expression. In the absence of Kr, the majority of secondary gap gene domains fail to be activated, and abdominal segmentation is terminated prematurely. Surprisingly, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>Nos</b> and Pum also to be involved in early head patterning, as the loss of Nos and Pum results in deletions and transformations of gnathal and pre-gnathal anlagen. Since the targets of Nos and Pum in head development remain to be identified, we propose that anterior patterning in Tribolium may involve additional maternal factors...|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> café {{that looked}} any good. Coming to the inn, we {{asked if there}} was a fire anywhere. There wasn't. We went up to our room. The chemist-daughters had lighted up opposite, one saw their bedroom as if it were one's own. In the dusk of the street the maskers were still jigging, all the youths still joyfully being women, but a little more roughly now. Away over the house-tops the purple-red of a dying sunset. And it was very cold.|$|E

60|$|With this {{regulation}} of our measures, we descended the mountains, {{and it was}} the second day before we quite reached the plain; where, however, to make us amends, we found a fine little rivulet of very good water, abundance of deer, a sort of creature like a hare, but not so nimble, but whose flesh we found very agreeable. But we were deceived in our intelligence, for <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> people; so we got no more prisoners to assist us in carrying our baggage.|$|E
60|$|We entered Carfax without {{trouble and}} found all things {{the same as}} on the first occasion.

60|$|We now {{proceeded}} {{to search the}} insensible burglars for arms. Upon the tall man we found a large revolver, a heavy billy, which seemed {{as if it had}} seen service, and a long-bladed knife. The stout man carried two double-barrelled pistols, and upon one of the fingers of his right hand wore a brass ring with a murderous-looking iron protuberance upon it, which, when driven forward by his powerful arm, was probably more dangerous than a billy. Upon the younger man <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>no</b> arms at all, and his hip pocket contained nothing but a small handbook on civil engineering.|$|E
