2500|$|Tyndall was an {{experimenter}} {{and laboratory}} apparatus builder, not an abstract model builder. But in his experiments on radiation and the heat-absorptive power of gases, {{he had an}} underlying agenda to understand the physics of molecules. Tyndall said in 1879: [...] "During nine years of labour {{on the subject of}} radiation , heat and light were handled throughout by me, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter." [...] This agenda is explicit in the title he picked for his 1872 book Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat. It is present less explicitly in the spirit of his widely read 1863 book Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion. Besides heat he also saw magnetism and sound propagation as reducible to molecular behaviours. Invisible molecular behaviours were the ultimate basis of all physical activity. With this mindset, and his experiments, he outlined an account whereby differing types of molecules have differing absorptions of infrared radiation because their molecular structures give them differing oscillating resonances. He'd gotten into the oscillating resonances idea because he'd seen that any one type of molecule has differing absorptions at differing radiant frequencies, and he was entirely persuaded that the only difference between one frequency and another is the frequency. He'd also seen that the absorption behaviour of molecules is quite {{different from that of the}} atoms composing the molecules. For example, the gas nitric oxide (NO) absorbed more than a thousand times more infrared radiation than either nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2).] the amount of radiant heat which they absorb is augmented more than a thousandfold. It may be a millionfold, for <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> know how small the absorption of the absolutely pure mixture really is. The act of chemical union is the sole cause of the enormous alteration in the amount of heat intercepted. The converse is also true: dissolve the chemical bond of the ammonia, and you instantly destroy the absorption." [...] He'd also seen in several kinds of experiments that – no matter whether a gas is a weak absorber of broad-spectrum radiant heat – any gas will strongly absorb the radiant heat coming from a separate body of the same type of gas.|$|E

In the current study, we assessed the between- and within-subject variation of these patterns. The within-subject variation was assessed by measuring the error patterns repeatedly over time for the same set of subjects. Many of these patterns were correlated, which indi- cates that they are fairly stable over time and thus subject-specific. The between-subject analysis, conversely, yielded hardly any significant correlations. We also measured general subject parameters that might explain this between-subject variation, but these parameters <b>did</b> <b>not</b> correlate with the error patterns.

40|$|In {{the meeting}} SN 1987 A 30 years later, I {{presented}} my minority {{view that the}} majority (or even all) of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are driven by jets rather than by neutrinos, and {{that the majority of}} type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) reach their explosion via the core degenerate scenario. New simulations presented at the meeting <b>did</b> <b>not</b> achieve an explosion of CCSNe. I critically examine other arguments that where presented in support of the neutrino-driven model, and present counter arguments that support the jet-driven explosion mechanism.
