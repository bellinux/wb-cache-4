The purpose of this study was to gain a deeper insight into how the system of middle managers systematic <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> looks like. The question was: How do six middle managers perceive and deal with systematic <b>work</b> <b>environment?</b> A qualitative study was conducted with six middle managers from a global company. During the analysis, there were three main themes to be recognized (cooperation and support facilitates the <b>work</b> <b>environment,</b> problem with the systematic work and difficulties with staff) and six sub themes. The results showed that respondents felt great support from management and safety representatives, which according to the respondents made ​​their systematic <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> easier.

40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} the {{implications}} of adopting an STS (science and technology studies) - based conceptualization of the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment.</b> We problematize how <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> research presently divides elements of working conditions into separate physical and psychosocial dimensions. Based on actor network theory, a currently dominant perspective {{in the field of}} STS, we discuss the concept of sociomaterial <b>work</b> <b>environment.</b> An ANT perspective on <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> is relevant and timely, we argue, first and foremost because more entities are embraced in the analyses. We argue that the ANT perspective leads to a more nuanced understanding of the <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> where it is not a set of predefined categories that is the focus of interest, but rather the <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> as multiple locally performed aspects of agency, translation, and collectively constructed reality. This perspective on <b>work</b> <b>environment,</b> we argue, addresses pivotal issues raised in the <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> debate during the last ten years, for instance of how the <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> as a concept saliently belongs to a social democratic Scandinavian agenda in which the singular employee in a <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> context is predominantly seen as a victim.

40|$|Prevention {{of stress}} related ill-health {{is one of}} the most {{important}} occupational health and safety issues of our time. The Swedish <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Act imposes extensive requirements regarding the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> on the employer. The employer is obliged to take all precautions necessary to prevent ill-health, also such ill-health associated with stress at work. These requirements are enforced through rules regarding co-operation between employers and employees, rules of supervision from the Swedish <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Authority and rules concerning criminal liability for <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> offences. The employer’s legal responsibility to prevent stress at work and injuries related to stress is thus, as a starting point, extensive. However, this responsibility is rarely demanded in legal practice. It has, for example, never yet occurred that an employer has been convicted of <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> offence for causing an employee stress related ill-health. This study deals with the employer's responsibility to prevent stress related ill-health and achieve a good psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> from a broad legal perspective. The study covers the fundamental purposes and legal principles that permeate the regulation of the <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> and thereby affects the employer's responsibility to prevent stress. The requirements that the <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Act impose on the employer through the rules concerning the state of the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> and the general preventive obligations are examined. Furthermore, the legal possibilities to demand responsibility for the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> according to the rules regarding co-operation, supervision and criminal responsibility are explored. The study demonstrates that the regulation is so vague in its design that the employer, in practice, is not given the possibility to achieve a clear understanding of what is required to prevent stress related ill-health. Therefore, introduction of clear binding provisions from the <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Authority regarding the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment,</b> to complement the general rules of the <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Act, is proposed...|$|R

The main issue that the diploma work deals with is whether SBC has the responsibility to select a building <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> co-ordinator for the planning and projecting before the contractor takes over responsibility for the <b>work</b> <b>environment.</b> Questions were answered by information from the <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Act, AFS 1999 : 3 and other material from the <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Authority.

He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most <b>work</b> <b>environments</b> was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy <b>work</b> <b>environments</b> and work culture.|$|E
